0	2000	Nice and smooth.
17000	20000	Welcome one and all back again to All Down Comics.
20000	22000	Permit Town is now in session!
22000	34000	It gets better and better. Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Hermit Town.
34000	36000	Dan Hermit!
40000	42000	Thank you. Wow.
42000	44000	What a big crowd.
44000	47000	What's with the big crowd, Jeff? What's going on?
47000	51000	Don't know. Maybe your show got cancelled.
51000	55000	It was cancelled last time. I guess it was a big crowd last time too.
55000	57000	I guess this is all we got now, huh?
57000	61000	This is all the people that were watching community.
61000	63000	All 200 of them.
63000	65000	What's next for you, Dan?
65000	67000	Are you going to rest on your laurels?
67000	69000	I'm really up in the air about that.
69000	75000	My fantasy, as you probably know, is to be able to not write ever again.
75000	82000	But there's this whole mortgage and I want to have a baby and baby need diapers.
82000	90000	Baby's got to go to college because it'll probably be a fucking athlete.
90000	93000	Because that's just my karma.
93000	97000	If baby is an athlete, it'll pay for itself, the scholarships and shit.
97000	99000	You're right.
99000	103000	Anyways, the money. Life is money. I'm in the second half of my life now.
103000	106000	It's time for the selfless half of my life to begin.
106000	110000	I have met with my goddess. I now need to atone with the cosmos.
110000	115000	Are you prepared to be a father? Do you think that you're ready to bring a child into this world?
115000	120000	I mean, worse guys than me have done it, right?
120000	123000	That's not an answer.
123000	128000	The population of this planet is all the evidence you need that it's not that hard a job.
129000	136000	Project yourself into a three-year-old child of yours and Aaron's.
136000	139000	You're a father of a three-year-old.
139000	141000	Am I in the child?
141000	145000	Project yourself into that reality.
145000	149000	You're a father of a three-year-old person.
149000	154000	What's your day-to-day, your quotidian shit?
154000	157000	Well, I'm hoping, yeah, I hope I can work from home by that time.
157000	163000	I hope I can be like a house husband and really put my full energy into the kid.
163000	168000	That's why I don't know what I'm going to do next because I could do a Fox deal.
168000	173000	They enrolled that when I got my job back at Community.
173000	179000	So there's that whole network sitcom world still waiting there.
179000	183000	But now I have this opportunity.
183000	186000	Without really burning any bridges, I could walk away from that.
186000	188000	I could write movies.
188000	190000	I could write a book.
190000	191000	I don't know.
191000	194000	What's your fantasy about your next project?
194000	197000	If you could have anything as your next thing, what would it be?
197000	202000	Well, I want to write this one movie that I've been trying to write for 15 years now.
202000	203000	Daedalus?
203000	204000	Yeah, yeah.
204000	206000	Do that one.
207000	210000	Can we talk about that or would that be bad business?
210000	212000	Well, I don't know.
212000	215000	No, I don't want to talk it out or anything.
215000	217000	Well, it's just a story I want to write.
217000	219000	Get off my dick.
219000	223000	But you and I used to go to the drawing room and talk about this movie,
223000	229000	and you would cry and not write that movie.
229000	231000	Yeah, I've been working on it for quite a while,
231000	233000	which is a good sign that you probably shouldn't.
233000	234000	I don't know.
234000	237000	I always tell the kids, don't throw that idea away,
237000	239000	that one you've been thinking about since high school,
239000	241000	because it's too precious.
241000	246000	It's a recipe for writer's block, like focusing on that thing.
246000	252000	But it also might be incumbent upon the elderly writers like myself
252000	256000	to actually get around to that thing they always wanted to do.
256000	258000	Do you feel elderly at 41?
258000	259000	Well, yeah.
259000	261000	I'm in the second half of my life.
261000	266000	I'm not about to blow anyone away as a Wunderkind.
266000	277000	Or more pronounced Wunderkind, right?
277000	279000	There's certain words I've only ever seen in type.
279000	282000	I've never heard anyone say it.
282000	286000	Bangle and Wunderkind.
286000	290000	Hey, you know that Playboy liquor store over in Hollywood?
290000	291000	Yeah.
291000	292000	It says Playboy liquor.
292000	293000	Do I?
293000	294000	How are they getting away with that?
294000	295000	Isn't that crazy?
295000	297000	Because if you guys ever drive past that Playboy liquor store,
297000	301000	there's a liquor store in LA that's called Playboy Liquor.
301000	304000	It is dead on the font of Playboy magazine,
304000	306000	but the Y is a martini glass.
306000	308000	And it's just like Playboy liquor.
308000	310000	Like, hey, you like Playboy.
310000	314000	It's rich tradition of high quality pornography.
314000	315000	Come on in.
315000	318000	It's just a fucking dirtball liquor store.
318000	319000	You can't do that.
319000	323000	You can't have like a Nintendo grocery store.
323000	325000	It's spelled Nintendo with a Y.
325000	329000	But you can do whatever you want.
329000	331000	Don't let me get in your way.
331000	334000	I'm half done living.
334000	337000	So Dan, you're getting married in what?
337000	338000	November?
338000	339000	Yeah.
339000	341000	And then you're a married fellow.
341000	342000	You're a husband.
342000	343000	Yeah.
343000	344000	And then you're going to have a baby.
344000	345000	Yeah.
345000	347000	Or as far as we know, it could be twins.
347000	348000	We don't know.
348000	352000	You might suddenly be the father of twin girls.
352000	354000	Am I projecting onto Jeff, or can anyone else
354000	358000	sense that he doesn't want me to get married and have a baby?
358000	362000	No, you're projecting.
362000	365000	Well, a couple people are getting that pheromone off of you.
365000	368000	You're projecting onto me.
368000	371000	I'm saying like you're going to be a fucking father.
371000	372000	That's crazy.
372000	373000	Yeah.
373000	375000	Crazy cool.
375000	376000	I'm all for it, man.
376000	378000	Imagine me replicating myself genetically.
378000	380000	I know.
380000	381000	Horrifying.
381000	382000	It's going to be amazing.
382000	387000	Imagine me, imagine me, imagine if you're a little kid
387000	393000	and you want a bedtime story, then this motherfucker walks in.
393000	396000	Best writer in the fucking world.
396000	397000	Whoa.
397000	398000	All right.
398000	399000	That's like.
399000	402000	Dan, give me a bedtime story.
403000	406000	I'm 18 months old.
406000	410000	My name is Vanessa.
410000	413000	Because Erin named your first daughter Vanessa.
413000	414000	Oh, man.
414000	417000	She's got worse in store.
417000	419000	What are the names?
419000	421000	I got one last night that she really likes.
421000	422000	Scorpion.
422000	425000	She really likes that song.
425000	430000	It's in that Pedro Almodovar movie.
431000	434000	There's a musician in one of the movies and he sings that song.
434000	438000	Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.
438000	441000	Contado.
441000	444000	Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo.
444000	447000	What's happening right now?
447000	448000	It's this song.
448000	449000	It's like a Spanish song.
449000	452000	So the baby's name is going to be coo, coo, coo, coo.
452000	455000	No, in the song, what is it?
455000	456000	Oh, no.
456000	459000	What does Erin want the baby to be called?
459000	460000	Erin?
460000	461000	Erin?
461000	462000	Now I forgot.
462000	463000	She's not here.
463000	464000	She's not here.
464000	465000	Oh.
465000	466000	She's in that show.
466000	467000	Paloma.
467000	468000	What?
468000	469000	Paloma.
469000	470000	Paloma means dove, right?
470000	471000	Yeah.
471000	472000	Who knew that?
472000	473000	Who's raising their hand?
473000	474000	I don't hear it yet.
474000	477000	Who are you?
477000	480000	His name is Darren McGathey.
480000	482000	Your name is what?
482000	483000	Another song.
483000	484000	Oh, okay.
484000	485000	You're just guessing that.
485000	487000	But you're right.
487000	488000	Paloma.
488000	489000	Yeah.
489000	493800	But you didn't have a conversation with me about this.
493800	494800	You guessed.
494800	495800	Yeah.
495800	496800	Paloma.
496800	497800	Paloma.
497800	498800	That's what it is.
498800	499800	Didn't Picasso name his daughter Paloma?
499800	500800	It means dove.
500800	501800	Yeah.
501800	502800	All right.
502800	503800	Fine.
503800	504800	What?
504800	505800	She's a hack.
505800	506800	I don't know.
506800	508320	But Paloma, I like to have a little daughter named Paloma.
508320	517800	For some reason, I wonder if I'm sexist, then let's take it to the bank.
518800	523800	I think I must be sexist, or whatever the opposite of sexist is.
523800	528120	I would really like to have a daughter, and I also don't care what her name is.
528120	533200	As much as I would care, is it just gender identity?
533200	540560	I'm more reticent to name my son something weird than my daughter.
540560	547080	I kind of feel like the daughter's name is just a fuck off.
547080	548920	It's misogynist.
548920	549920	I don't know.
549920	553880	Or is it like I'm already unconditionally loving my daughter, and I'm just going to
553880	557440	make my son's life a living hell, because I'm going to be thinking, that's little me.
557440	558440	That's a little me.
558440	560840	And the daughter, because of my...
560840	562800	Why wouldn't your daughter be a little you too?
562800	564560	You know why, Jeff.
564560	565560	I don't know why.
565560	571480	She'll have a hole where her wiener should be.
571480	575000	And you just can't...
576000	579080	She's going to have her hands full with problems.
579080	580600	She's not going to...
580600	581600	No.
581600	582600	I'm very much...
582600	588680	What would you prefer, if you could make a choice, son or daughter?
588680	594080	I think I would prefer a daughter, because I'm terrified of getting eaten by the kid.
594080	600960	Like in a mythical sense, like prom night, and your teenage kid comes after you drunk,
600960	603800	and he's like, fuck you, old man.
603800	604800	That whole energy.
605600	607720	Because she can't beat you up when she's 18?
607720	610040	She'll beat Erin up.
610040	611040	Her issues will be with...
611040	612920	She'll be like, you old lady, fuck you.
612920	618600	And I'll be like, now, now.
618600	625320	Come sit with daddy and watch Blazing Saddles.
625320	626320	Fetch my bifocals.
626320	628880	Does Erin have a name for the boy, if it's a boy?
628880	632240	She doesn't have a name for Saddle Soap.
632400	634240	I've heard her throw out Cormac.
634240	635240	Cormac?
635240	636240	I reckon.
636240	637240	I reckon.
640240	641240	Connor.
641240	642240	Connor, is it...
643240	644240	All C names.
644240	646240	I like biblical names.
646240	648240	I like, my name's Daniel.
648240	650240	What does that mean?
650240	652240	God will be my judge.
653240	654240	For real?
654240	655240	Yeah.
655240	658240	And I interpret that to mean, and only God.
659240	660240	Only God.
660240	662240	There's a dot, dot, dot after that.
662240	664240	Only God will tell you to tie your shoes.
664240	665240	Yeah, exactly.
665240	666240	God will be my judge.
666240	668240	That's it, motherfucker.
669240	671240	Yeah, the story of Daniel is great.
671240	672240	Not Sony, not NBC.
672240	674240	Daniel was a dream interpreter for a king,
674240	679240	and then his rival colleagues, these hacks,
679240	683240	they tried to, they framed, they turned him in
683240	688240	for praying to the wrong God, secretly.
688240	691240	And he was using his position as a dream interpreter
691240	695240	to kind of move the king in a Yahweh direction.
695240	700240	And the king was kind of under his psychological thumb
700240	702240	because he was good at what he did.
702240	706240	He was winning him with being good at his job.
706240	710240	And so his rivals tried to turn him in.
710240	712240	And I can't remember how the rest of the story goes
712240	715240	except it ends with all of those, right?
715240	717240	They throw him in the lion's den,
717240	719240	and then God closes the lion's mouths,
719240	721240	and they pull Daniel out, and they go,
721240	724240	I guess you're on the winning team.
724240	728240	And then they throw all of the guys that fucked with him
728240	731240	and all of their families and all of their families' families
731240	734240	into the lion's den, and the lions eat them.
737240	739240	It's a horrible story.
740240	742240	God will be my judge.
742240	745240	And also he'll kick ass on your behalf.
745240	748240	Yes, he's in my corner.
749240	751240	So I like that name.
754240	758240	I wouldn't mind just a straightforward kind of Hebrew name
758240	759240	for my kid.
759240	760240	Like what?
760240	761240	I don't know.
761240	762240	I have to look it up.
762240	763240	I want to look up all the stories
763240	766240	and see what kind of myth I would like the kid
766240	770240	to be able to delve into when he learns what his name is.
770240	772240	Do you feel like your parents thought about Daniel
772240	776240	as a name for you and had foresight?
776240	780240	My mom said that she chose the names based on...
780240	784240	She named me and my brother with these alliterative names,
784240	785240	Doug and Dan.
785240	789240	She said at one point that the way she picked the names
789240	791240	was she imagined them being announced
791240	795240	over the loudspeakers at a football arena.
796240	801240	Like, quarterback Dan Harmon at...
801240	802240	Douglas?
802240	805240	Yeah, like, oh, there's the Harmon brothers.
805240	807240	Doug and Dan out there,
807240	809240	throwing the football around.
815240	816240	Anyways...
818240	820240	I want to see you as a father.
820240	822240	You're gonna.
822240	823240	I know.
823240	825240	I'm going to and I want to.
825240	828240	I want to see you change your diaper.
829240	832240	I'm going to be good at that.
832240	835240	What qualifies you to be changing your diaper?
835240	838240	Well, I don't change my underwear very often.
838240	841240	So when I do, it's gross.
841240	843240	So I'm prepared for...
843240	846240	No, no, you're not prepared for that.
846240	847240	No, I am.
847240	849240	Why does a guy that doesn't change his own underwear
849240	852240	qualify to change another human being's underwear?
852240	853240	Because I take them off and I'm like...
853240	855240	And I throw them in the hamper
855240	857240	and that's what you do when you change a diaper.
858240	860240	There's shit everywhere.
860240	863240	It's about tidiness, it's about health.
865240	868240	I'll see you in the parental funny papers, baby.
869240	871240	I'm going to raise the fuck out of this kid.
871240	875240	You being a father, you're going to get what you don't want.
875240	879240	You're going to get some strangely...
879240	881240	the person that you didn't want to raise,
881240	883240	a human being,
883240	887240	and you'll be there giving it...
887240	890240	probably good bedtime stories.
890240	893240	What would the bedtime stories be?
893240	895240	That opportunity went away.
898240	900240	Chicken shit.
904240	906240	You're going to have a child.
906240	911240	This is the batting cages of learning how to tell a baby's story.
914240	917240	Vanessa...
923240	926240	Once there was this farmer
926240	929240	and he kept telling in his fields
929240	932240	so he could make little jelly bean plants.
933240	936240	And then one day one of the jelly bean plants
936240	938240	looked up at her and said,
938240	940240	please don't harvest me.
940240	942240	I'm a magical jelly bean plant.
942240	944240	I don't want to be harvested.
944240	946240	I need to stay here
946240	950240	so that I can keep talking to you and hanging out.
950240	953240	You can have all the other jelly bean plants.
953240	955240	This is what I'm talking about.
955240	957240	Don't cut me down.
958240	962240	So the farmer who was also a princess
968240	971240	obliged the magic jelly bean plant,
971240	973240	harvested all the others,
973240	975240	took them inside to her father and said,
975240	977240	here's the jelly beans. He counted them up.
977240	980240	I count only seven jelly bean plants
980240	983240	worth of jelly beans here,
983240	985240	Rodrigo.
988240	990240	That is because one of them was magical
990240	991240	and asked me not...
991240	993240	Silence!
993240	996240	Bring me my belt.
996240	1000240	Why?
1000240	1004240	You know why.
1006240	1008240	Where is it?
1008240	1011240	It's over there on the dresser.
1011240	1014240	Slowly Rodrigo went and grabbed the belt
1014240	1017240	off the dresser with trembling hands,
1017240	1019240	handed it to her father,
1019240	1022240	who put it on because his pants
1022240	1025240	were just falling down a little.
1027240	1030240	And then he ran out to the field with Rodrigo
1030240	1032240	and they talked to the jelly bean plant
1032240	1034240	and they had an hour conversation
1034240	1036240	about covering a wide range of topics
1036240	1040240	and including how to irrigate better
1040240	1042240	so that they ended up growing more
1042240	1044240	jelly bean plants than ever.
1044240	1048240	So the moral is go to sleep.
1051240	1055240	It's Star Wars episode one.
1055240	1057240	Yeah.
1057240	1059240	You're gonna be a good dad.
1059240	1061240	Yeah, thank you.
1061240	1064240	Thanks, thanks everybody.
1064240	1065240	I'm just looking through...
1065240	1068240	This is another Playboy licker.
1068240	1070240	Bumper stickers, I don't really...
1070240	1071240	Oh dear.
1071240	1072240	I wouldn't be the first person
1072240	1073240	to not understand bumper stickers.
1073240	1075240	I understand like if you're in a band,
1075240	1077240	you put your band's bumper sticker
1077240	1078240	on your bumper because it's like,
1078240	1079240	hey, it's my car,
1079240	1080240	I'm gonna promote my band
1080240	1081240	with my bumper sticker.
1081240	1083240	I understand like...
1084240	1088240	The clever ones, like the pithy ones,
1088240	1091240	like here's a little something about me,
1091240	1093240	you know, I don't get it.
1093240	1095240	But we don't have to talk about it.
1095240	1097240	Wait, for instance...
1097240	1098240	I can't remember.
1098240	1099240	I don't know.
1099240	1100240	I just saw...
1100240	1101240	Well, I saw...
1101240	1102240	Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
1102240	1103240	I just don't...
1103240	1105240	I can't think of any really, honestly.
1105240	1106240	There's just what, you know,
1106240	1109240	what about ones that espouse
1109240	1111240	like a political agenda?
1112240	1113240	I think it's a bad idea
1113240	1114240	to have a bumper sticker
1114240	1118240	because it can't be so large
1118240	1120240	that I could read it from far enough away
1120240	1122240	to be safe to read your bumper sticker.
1122240	1124240	I have to get close enough
1124240	1126240	to read your political philosophy
1126240	1128240	and maybe hit you.
1129240	1131240	I'm almost positive
1131240	1132240	that no one on this earth
1132240	1134240	has ever been converted to anything
1134240	1136240	by a bumper sticker.
1136240	1138240	So I don't know what purpose...
1139240	1141240	Is it just the idea that it's just like,
1141240	1143240	we'll whittle away at you?
1143240	1145240	I saw a bumper sticker that said,
1145240	1147240	Honk if you're horny.
1147240	1148240	You like that one?
1148240	1149240	I honked.
1150240	1152240	You ever see that guy on the corner
1152240	1154240	outside the Vista Theater
1154240	1156240	and he's always holding a sign
1156240	1158240	that says Honk for Peace?
1158240	1160240	And he keeps gesturing,
1160240	1162240	he seems really exasperated
1162240	1164240	when people aren't honking.
1164240	1165240	And then people honk
1165240	1167240	and then he just gives him a big thumb up.
1168240	1171240	I got 40 questions for that guy.
1176240	1178240	How do you know when you're finished?
1181240	1182240	How does that work?
1182240	1185240	Why is he mad at people who don't honk?
1185240	1187240	I can already see the anger on his face
1187240	1189240	when he doesn't get the honks he wants.
1189240	1191240	So I know that if he was in control of an army
1191240	1193240	he'd attack someone.
1194240	1196240	But he's just in control of a sign.
1197240	1198240	I've seen that guy,
1198240	1201240	but before I see him I hear a bunch of honking
1201240	1202240	which makes you unhappy
1202240	1204240	because of the sound of horns honking.
1204240	1205240	Yeah, it's like make your baby cry
1205240	1207240	if you want world peace.
1207240	1209240	Poke your baby in the eye.
1209240	1212240	It's like a sound that distresses you.
1213240	1215240	Isn't that wonderful how babies crying
1215240	1217240	really makes us upset on an airplane?
1217240	1219240	You hear that sound and you're like,
1219240	1221240	you think you're a bad person
1221240	1222240	because you're like,
1222240	1223240	shut that fucking baby up.
1223240	1225240	But really the reason you're upset
1225240	1228240	is because you're having an instinctive reaction
1228240	1231240	to a human child in distress
1231240	1233240	and what you're frustrated by
1233240	1235240	is the fact that you can't do anything about it.
1235240	1236240	You're not allowed to do anything
1236240	1240240	because we're a disenfranchised tribe.
1240240	1242240	Ryan Stiles is the coolest thing in the world.
1242240	1245240	We're on a plane and Ryan has three children
1245240	1248240	and there's a woman that brought a baby on board
1248240	1251240	in first class and the baby was just screaming
1251240	1255240	and probably a three-year-old boy
1255240	1261240	just fucking absolutely abject pain, just screaming.
1261240	1265240	And Ryan said, can I take your baby?
1265240	1268240	And Ryan took the child and he doesn't like to fly.
1268240	1270240	Ryan is a bad flyer.
1270240	1272240	He does not like flying.
1272240	1275240	He took the child and walked out of first class
1275240	1277240	all the way to the back of the plane
1277240	1280240	and the crying stops.
1280240	1283240	Ryan killed that baby.
1283240	1287240	The North Korean soldiers never got on the bus.
1287240	1290240	All we heard was a door open.
1290240	1293240	Ryan came back with a quiet child
1293240	1295240	and sat down and leaned his chair back
1295240	1299240	and put the baby, the toddler, on his chest
1299240	1302240	and they went to sleep for the next four hours.
1302240	1304240	And the mother was like, when we landed,
1304240	1305240	she's like, how did you do that?
1305240	1309240	He goes, give it a change of scenery.
1309240	1311240	I take the baby for a walk once in a while.
1311240	1314240	I move it around and don't panic.
1314240	1316240	It was so cool.
1316240	1319240	It's possible to take a crying baby on a plane
1319240	1322240	and assuage the pain.
1322240	1326240	Yeah.
1326240	1329240	I always imagine the babies, their ears aren't popping.
1329240	1331240	I know how terrifying it must be for the baby.
1331240	1333240	I always think about that too.
1333240	1335240	People bring animals on the plane,
1335240	1337240	like they're in the cargo bay or whatever
1337240	1341240	and they must be back there like, what the fuck is going on?
1341240	1343240	Isn't it weird how dogs love being in cars
1343240	1346240	and cats are like, fuck you?
1346240	1347240	It's so amazing.
1347240	1349240	Dogs are so comfortable with everything.
1349240	1352240	Aaron just puts fucking t-shirts on the dog.
1352240	1354240	It's a hat on his head.
1354240	1357240	He doesn't get it.
1357240	1359240	He just feels like, oh, this is my job.
1359240	1362240	I'm dressed like a lizard now.
1362240	1364240	Cats are like, he puts something on a cat
1364240	1368240	and it starts running around backwards like a crayfish,
1368240	1371240	trying to back out from it.
1371240	1375240	Cats do not cotton any kind of unnatural behavior
1375240	1378240	or costuming.
1378240	1380240	All right.
1380240	1382240	Let's break the Kumail glass
1382240	1385240	because to give this show a kick on the ass,
1385240	1389240	Kumail Nanjiani.
1389240	1395240	Hello.
1395240	1397240	I'm hungover, so the show's low energy,
1397240	1400240	so I'm bringing out the big guns.
1400240	1402240	The show's been going great.
1402240	1404240	I've been listening and watching.
1404240	1407240	These people love it.
1407240	1409240	They're like, yeah, kind of.
1409240	1411240	We're on board, kind of.
1411240	1412240	Kumail, is it just me
1412240	1415240	or do you get sexier every time I see you?
1415240	1418240	I've been taking pills.
1418240	1419240	What sort of pills?
1419240	1422240	Just like diet pills.
1422240	1423240	They work, guys.
1423240	1426240	Don't listen to what moms say.
1426240	1428240	Here, I'm making you a drink.
1428240	1429240	Oh, thank you.
1429240	1430240	Thank you.
1430240	1432240	I'm just using my hand to put the ice in the cup.
1432240	1435240	Kumail, do you fancy yourself a father?
1435240	1439240	You know, it's so weird that you guys are talking about this
1439240	1441240	because we've been talking about it.
1441240	1444240	It's been like, I don't know.
1444240	1445240	I don't know.
1445240	1447240	It's some of those things your whole life,
1447240	1449240	you know, you think life's going to be a certain way,
1449240	1450240	supposed to do certain things,
1450240	1452240	and my whole life I've been like, I'll be a dad someday.
1452240	1453240	I'll be a dad someday.
1453240	1454240	My kid's going to be great.
1454240	1456240	And then at a certain point, you're like,
1456240	1459240	well, do I really want to be a dad?
1459240	1462240	It's hard to ask yourself a question
1462240	1465240	that you thought the answer was made for you your whole life.
1465240	1468240	And now in my 30s, I'm like, do I really want that?
1468240	1469240	I don't know.
1469240	1471240	It's very hard to think about.
1471240	1473240	I would imagine you being a good father.
1474240	1475240	I don't think I'd be a bad father.
1475240	1476240	I think I'd be a good father.
1476240	1480240	But I don't know if I want to be a father.
1480240	1481240	I don't know.
1481240	1482240	We've just started.
1482240	1485240	Certainly we don't need that incumbent upon us
1485240	1490240	to choke the planet with more flesh.
1490240	1492240	Yeah, but...
1492240	1495240	If people are having second thoughts about it.
1495240	1497240	That's like the worst gynecologist ever.
1497240	1499240	Listen.
1500240	1504240	You're going to have a little thing that chokes the planet with more flesh.
1504240	1505240	That's right.
1505240	1506240	More flesh.
1506240	1508240	Yahweh said in the Old Testament, right?
1508240	1512240	He said, go forth and choke the planet with more flesh.
1513240	1516240	It's going to hurt when you take a shit from now on.
1516240	1518240	Dan, are you driven?
1518240	1521240	Do you feel like a party who needs to be a father wants to be a father?
1521240	1523240	Why do you want to be a father?
1523240	1524240	Or do you feel that way?
1524240	1526240	I feel driven to it.
1526240	1530240	I always go, when I have to make a choice,
1530240	1532240	I go best case, worst case.
1532240	1535240	Compare all the possibilities.
1535240	1539240	The worst case scenario of having a kid is having a kid
1539240	1541240	and just being like anybody else that has a kid.
1541240	1544240	Just like, ah, I had a kid.
1544240	1549240	Sometimes people with kids secretly warn you when no one's listening.
1549240	1550240	Don't do it.
1550240	1551240	Oh, yeah.
1551240	1553240	I've been pulled aside at parties.
1553240	1554240	Listen.
1555240	1556240	But it's always tongue in chest.
1556240	1557240	I mean, they mean it.
1557240	1558240	But it's truth and jest.
1558240	1565240	But that's the worst case scenario is regretting.
1565240	1569240	Is having a kid and wondering what it would be like
1569240	1571240	to be a bachelor and play video games
1571240	1574240	or just be with Aaron and not have a kid.
1574240	1576240	Like what Shrob and Kate are doing.
1576240	1577240	They're not having kids.
1577240	1578240	They're just hanging out.
1578240	1585240	The worst case scenario is worrying about that.
1585240	1586240	What am I missing?
1586240	1592240	The worst case scenario with not having a kid is far worse.
1592240	1597240	It's like being 70 years old and going like,
1597240	1598240	I've had a pretty good life.
1598240	1600240	We've had our ups and downs and our chuckles.
1600240	1601240	I'm going to die.
1601240	1603240	Bring in the people I'll say my final words to.
1603240	1605240	There is no one.
1605240	1607240	Bring in little Danny Jr.
1608240	1612240	You traded his soul in for playing Wolfenstein.
1614240	1615240	That sounds pretty good.
1617240	1620240	That's no reason to have a child is that you feel like
1620240	1625240	at your dying breath that you wish there was a younger version of you.
1625240	1626240	But it's not just about my dying breath.
1626240	1629240	I'm talking about all those years in between too.
1629240	1634240	What I'm trying to say is that wondering what it would have been like
1634240	1641240	to have children is for me a more dire fate than wondering
1641240	1643240	what it would be like to not have children.
1643240	1646240	Something that I have 41 years of experience with.
1646240	1652240	I know the path that I've been on and I know that sometimes
1652240	1653240	I wish it would last forever.
1653240	1654240	You're like, this is going great.
1654240	1656240	Let's bring a couple children into this.
1656240	1663240	I also know that my hair is falling out and that my boobs are sagging
1663240	1668240	and I have boobs and I'm melting.
1668240	1669240	I'm dying.
1669240	1670240	I'm disintegrating.
1670240	1673240	So are you combating mortality by having children?
1673240	1674240	Is that what it is?
1674240	1677240	No, it's not like a Pharaoh thing like I want my legacy.
1677240	1678240	It's not.
1678240	1679240	Because it is for a lot of people.
1679240	1683240	No, I would never put that whammy on a kid.
1683240	1685240	I hope he's a garbage man.
1685240	1687240	My mom used to tell me, be a garbage man.
1687240	1689240	Be the best garbage man everybody works with.
1689240	1691240	I don't give a shit what you do.
1692240	1693240	Because who are we kidding?
1693240	1696240	Everybody's been doing remarkable things for 6,000 years.
1696240	1697240	Where has it gotten them?
1697240	1698240	Who gives a fuck?
1698240	1702240	Just have a good life, Harmon Jr.
1702240	1705240	That was like inspiring and cynical at the same time.
1705240	1713240	The awareness of my mortality is, I'm saying like,
1713240	1719240	I want to tell a story with my life and I'm halfway through that story.
1720240	1726240	And if, for me, reproduction is the second half of a full life.
1726240	1728240	Oh, I thought it was like setting up a sequel, you know,
1728240	1730240	when like Freddy's Hand comes out again.
1730240	1733240	You're like, oh, there's more Harmon happening.
1733240	1737240	I don't even know how to think about this because, you know,
1737240	1740240	for me, a reason that I always assumed I wanted kids was like,
1740240	1742240	you know, that's how you, because I have, you know,
1742240	1744240	I've been thinking about death my whole life.
1744240	1747240	And I'm like, that's how, for me, you combat it, you get a kid,
1747240	1750240	and then that person continues on the stuff you've done and you sort of
1750240	1751240	live on through them.
1751240	1755240	But now I'm like, well, I kind of want to live on through the stuff I do,
1755240	1758240	you know, like you sort of like the, you know,
1758240	1761240	shows you right or whatever that kind of stuff.
1761240	1767240	So, so I think I would rather do that, but I don't know.
1767240	1769240	I don't even know how to start thinking about it.
1769240	1770240	It seems like so much.
1770240	1774240	Your parents have an opinion about whether you should be a father or not.
1774240	1775240	Me?
1775240	1776240	Yeah.
1776240	1779240	They have a very strong opinion.
1779240	1781240	They're very proud.
1781240	1783240	I'm like, now, I kind of want to be like,
1783240	1786240	remember how difficult it was when I brought a white woman home?
1786240	1787240	Now I'm bringing a person.
1787240	1789240	You can't even separate the person.
1789240	1790240	It's like a swirl.
1790240	1792240	Like they're together.
1792240	1794240	It's going to be so much more complicated.
1794240	1801240	Like this is like we went to fucking Cold Stone and mixed it all up.
1801240	1802240	There's no conversation now.
1802240	1804240	So do you think they're excited about that or?
1804240	1805240	Yeah.
1805240	1807240	I was just with them this weekend and they brought it up a lot.
1807240	1810240	So they're, I mean, they're like, when you, you will, you reference,
1810240	1812240	you're how difficult it was when I brought a white woman home.
1812240	1815240	Like, what was the family situation when you normally started going out?
1815240	1817240	When you, when, when it was time to meet the parents,
1817240	1820240	we taught, we've talked about your parents, like ambitions for you.
1820240	1822240	He wanted you to be a doctor.
1822240	1823240	Yeah.
1823240	1829240	I mean, they, so they had maybe ambitions for you in terms of your mate as well.
1829240	1830240	Oh yeah.
1830240	1834240	They used to send me pictures of women, like, cause it's all arranged marriage,
1834240	1835240	you know?
1835240	1838240	So it's all these women who, so this is how it's set up.
1838240	1841240	There's like older women in the community who are always aware of like,
1841240	1843240	Oh, you know that they have a girl.
1843240	1844240	She just there in the market.
1844240	1847240	Like, so they, they know the guys and they know the women in the market.
1847240	1851240	So they'd show me these pictures that are obviously these old ladies taking
1851240	1853240	pictures of like these girls at weddings and stuff.
1853240	1857240	Like, you know, they're eating, they're like caught unaware.
1857240	1858240	It's completely true.
1858240	1861240	And my mom would send it over with like sort of like a resume.
1861240	1863240	Like she's, you know, she's pre-med.
1863240	1864240	She's got a green card.
1864240	1867240	So that's not going to be a problem.
1867240	1868240	And I kept saying no to them.
1868240	1873240	And I swear the women got more and more attractive.
1873240	1876240	And the last one was like fucking Cleopatra.
1876240	1878240	She was stunning.
1878240	1882240	So if you're in Pakistan and you're listening to this podcast, like always like
1882240	1883240	hold out.
1883240	1884240	Oh yeah.
1884240	1885240	Oh yeah.
1885240	1886240	Hold out.
1886240	1887240	They're bluffing.
1887240	1889240	Even if you're going to stay in the system.
1889240	1890240	What was her?
1890240	1892240	I wonder if it works that way for the, for the poor girls.
1892240	1893240	Yeah.
1893240	1894240	Like do their men.
1894240	1895240	I don't know choices.
1895240	1896240	Yeah.
1896240	1898240	But it's like kind of when you go to a store and you're like, Hey, what, what,
1898240	1899240	what's the shit in the back?
1899240	1901240	What do you have in the back?
1901240	1902240	Yeah.
1902240	1903240	What's, what's that girl?
1903240	1905240	Cleopatra is that girl.
1905240	1906240	What's her stake in it?
1906240	1907240	Like, what is she?
1907240	1909240	She's getting me, dude.
1909240	1910240	What the fuck?
1910240	1914240	They're merging the house Nangiani with.
1914240	1915240	Yeah.
1915240	1916240	It is like that.
1916240	1922240	It's the iron bank will have a line of credit for that.
1922240	1923240	Yeah.
1923240	1924240	No, it totally is like that.
1924240	1930240	It's more of a, a pact between two families rather than just love.
1930240	1933240	We actually have a term for a marriage that's not arranged.
1933240	1934240	They call it love marriage.
1934240	1939240	It's called love marriage, which here seems so redundant, but over there.
1939240	1941240	And they say it's like a bad term.
1941240	1942240	Like, Oh, she had a love marriage.
1942240	1945240	You know, love marriage.
1945240	1947240	I mean, she had a say in the matter.
1947240	1949240	No, you always have a say in the matter.
1949240	1953240	The difference is whether you get set up, you sort of hang out.
1953240	1956240	So it'll be like the two families meet and then they're like, find an excuse to
1956240	1959240	leave and the guy and the girl are there and you talk.
1959240	1962240	And then you decide like, yeah, this is the person rest of my life.
1962240	1963240	She likes purple.
1963240	1964240	Is it male?
1964240	1966240	Is it male driven or female driven?
1966240	1968240	Like who's driving that car?
1968240	1970240	Both people can say no.
1970240	1974240	It's like in that it's fairly even for how crazy a system it is.
1974240	1977240	The woman can say no and she doesn't have to get married and the guy can say no
1977240	1979240	and they don't have both have to say yes.
1979240	1980240	All right.
1980240	1981240	Yeah.
1981240	1982240	So crazy.
1982240	1984240	It's a little charming.
1984240	1988240	Do you think it is a little charming?
1988240	1989240	It's not charming.
1989240	1994240	Well, I mean, it's charming from the vantage point of having to deal with it.
1994240	1995240	I'm currently pissed off.
1995240	1999240	I mean, I think we all are about that fucking douchebag that that didn't get
1999240	2003240	laid and killed a bunch of people and blames it on women.
2004240	2005240	And also there's two.
2005240	2006240	I'm just hungover.
2006240	2007240	You're bummed out about that guy.
2007240	2008240	Yeah.
2008240	2009240	Yeah, I know.
2009240	2010240	That's what I mean.
2010240	2012240	And also like there's been two attacks from Griffith Park.
2012240	2016240	Girls just taking a walk and they can't take a walk because a guy is going to
2016240	2021240	fucking attack them like like it's different being a woman than being a guy
2021240	2023240	because men expect things.
2023240	2026240	And when they don't get what they want, they actually do attack.
2026240	2028240	It's the worst fucking thing in the world.
2028240	2029240	I used to.
2029240	2033240	I was like, I made it into my late 20s before I knew that that was a real
2033240	2034240	thing.
2034240	2037240	Like I would get mad at my girlfriends where they would come home and they
2037240	2042240	were like the first girlfriend that came home and said like the guy out there,
2042240	2046240	you know, the one on the corner that's selling the oranges.
2046240	2050240	Like he makes these fucking sounds like like when I walk by him, I'm like,
2050240	2051240	what are you talking about?
2051240	2052240	Come on.
2052240	2053240	Guys selling oranges.
2053240	2054240	He's sucking on oranges.
2054240	2057240	He's like, no, it happens all the time.
2057240	2062240	He's just being angry that you're a woman and then that doesn't happen the
2062240	2063240	other way.
2063240	2067240	Or yeah, making like they make like kissy, kissy sounds and like and the and
2067240	2068240	comments and stuff like that.
2068240	2074240	If a woman's not with with a man, sometimes if she is like like like the
2074240	2079240	crazy thing to me was when I was like 29 that when I first was being
2079240	2085240	introduced to that concept in a secondhand fashion by one of my girlfriends,
2085240	2091240	my immediate emotional response was was knock it off.
2091240	2092240	Stop.
2092240	2093240	Stop being dramatic.
2093240	2100240	Like I had like a weird membrane there that was inherently misogynist.
2100240	2104240	Like I was as if there was like like there was a there was a robocop
2104240	2110240	directive like like in my programming there were where women like like like
2110240	2114240	like the idea of I was just I just believed in my brain.
2114240	2115240	It was like I was like you're making that up.
2115240	2116240	That's crazy.
2116240	2119240	Like like like women don't walk around on the sidewalk and just constantly get
2119240	2120240	harassed.
2120240	2121240	It's every day.
2121240	2124240	And it's also like an everyday thing.
2124240	2126240	I can't speak for women.
2126240	2129240	There's probably women here that would absolutely say it better.
2129240	2135240	But like you're prepared for guys to be shitty to you at all times and and
2135240	2138240	knowing that they're riddled with testosterone.
2138240	2142240	Learn how to not get raped by what you wear, what you say, how you reject
2142240	2143240	somebody.
2143240	2145240	You say you have a boyfriend when you don't.
2145240	2147240	You give a fake phone number.
2147240	2149240	Like guys never have to do that.
2149240	2151240	It's just the ugliest thing in the world.
2151240	2157240	And I hope that the people that died on this fucking because that little
2157240	2163240	asshole I hope the conversation becomes something so cool that actually like
2163240	2164240	guys change.
2164240	2168240	Like I actually grow up and learn that what they want isn't a mandate.
2169240	2174240	Women aren't simply things that will get fucked.
2174240	2176240	They can say fuck you.
2176240	2179240	I don't want to fuck you.
2179240	2181240	That's not who I am.
2181240	2185240	Yeah I think that's I mean I don't want to be the guy who says it's over.
2185240	2186240	No more problems.
2186240	2191240	But I want to be hopeful and say I feel like when I monitor the younger
2191240	2193240	generation I feel like they are.
2193240	2195240	It's so far away from that.
2195240	2199240	Women got to vote way later than black people.
2199240	2203240	We had to hate our women.
2203240	2207240	We will be misogynist way after we fix racism.
2207240	2209240	Like terrible.
2209240	2211240	And women are the coolest.
2211240	2213240	They have everything on us.
2213240	2217240	Now I'm being misogynist.
2217240	2219240	I'm even fucking going on.
2219240	2221240	I just wish.
2221240	2223240	Can I start just grabbing their bodies?
2223240	2225240	Is that what that was going?
2225240	2226240	Were you going to talk?
2226240	2227240	Go ahead.
2227240	2228240	Sorry.
2228240	2229240	How was it going to get misogynistic?
2229240	2230240	I want to know.
2230240	2233240	It's like a guy talking about what women should or should not get.
2233240	2237240	What they shouldn't be is treated like anything other than a person.
2237240	2242240	And this little guy is saying he's probably crazy like whatever the fuck
2242240	2243240	was going on with him.
2243240	2248240	The idea that because he's a 24 year old virgin and he has to kill blonde
2248240	2249240	women.
2249240	2254240	And then on Twitter people backing that guy up saying hey it's memorial day
2254240	2255240	man.
2255240	2259240	Stop your feminist bullshit and support our troops.
2259240	2260240	Wait what?
2260240	2263240	That's a pretty big segue.
2263240	2268240	That's a weird comment section to plant any flag.
2268240	2271240	There were people because it was the yes all women thing going on.
2271240	2275240	As opposed to the not all men are rapey.
2275240	2277240	I'm the coolest guy.
2277240	2279240	Not all men do that.
2279240	2280240	But women are saying no.
2280240	2284240	Yes all women have to learn how to not get raped when they walk through a fucking
2284240	2287240	parking garage.
2287240	2289240	Women have to deal with it.
2289240	2290240	All women do.
2290240	2292240	Yes not all men are bad people.
2292240	2302240	But all women have to learn how to deal with guys being bad at rejection.
2302240	2307240	I really wish I had met that little fucker the day before he did that.
2307240	2314240	Wait you didn't have like a psychic dream that this was going on?
2314240	2317240	What's funny is I kind of did.
2317240	2318240	What?
2318240	2319240	What?
2319240	2320240	Go ahead.
2320240	2322240	You have the floor.
2322240	2323240	No I don't.
2323240	2326240	What was the psychic dream that I don't want to get off from?
2326240	2327240	No it's not.
2327240	2328240	Just let's do a quick side bar.
2328240	2335240	It's almost like I feel like I wake up after things happen and feel like something subliminally
2335240	2336240	happened.
2336240	2339240	Oh you like sort of backtrack and you're like oh that thing.
2339240	2345240	I did not have a dream that a guy was going to go punish women because he's an asshole.
2345240	2349240	That would be a stupid dream because that should be the story of every movie that we
2349240	2350240	make.
2350240	2353240	I didn't think we were going to talk about this guy because I imagine that all the podcasts
2353240	2359240	are but my goal as always is originality.
2359240	2366240	But now that we're on the topic I just watched the video in the green room and I was stricken
2366240	2371240	by how strangely disingenuous.
2371240	2374240	He acted like he was acting when he's talking.
2374240	2377240	Because his father's a director.
2377240	2378240	Oh really?
2378240	2379240	Are you joking?
2379240	2381240	No he's an AD.
2382240	2385240	It was so weird acting like he's like Josh Hartnett or something.
2385240	2388240	I'm so into it.
2388240	2390240	This fucking giggles.
2390240	2391240	But that's so weird.
2391240	2393240	You're being shitty at being a bad guy.
2393240	2394240	He's acting.
2394240	2400240	Yeah but I didn't understand that because normally when somebody is acting that way
2400240	2406240	and you feel like they're being dishonest there's something inside them that they're
2406240	2408240	suppressing and keeping down.
2408240	2414240	For instance I hate women because they don't love me and I want to kill all of them.
2414240	2417240	Like this guy's saying that.
2417240	2419240	So what are you hiding?
2419240	2420240	What was his secret?
2420240	2422240	He seemed so fake.
2422240	2426240	The secret is he's an asshole.
2426240	2432240	He probably had everything going for him except the fact that nobody likes him.
2432240	2435240	That's what he says.
2435240	2438240	I bet he had a real shitty vibe as a person.
2438240	2441240	We have a young lady raising her hand in the audience.
2441240	2443240	There was something about this so he was acting.
2443240	2444240	Bring her up.
2444240	2446240	Come on say hey.
2446240	2449240	Adam take it easy buddy.
2449240	2451240	Adam gets to bring her up.
2451240	2455240	He's got by the way he has a chair for his laptop.
2455240	2457240	Oh nobody sat here.
2457240	2458240	What's your name?
2458240	2459240	Annie.
2459240	2460240	Hello Annie.
2460240	2461240	Hi.
2461240	2464240	So I just read an article it's not like I knew this guy or anything.
2464240	2467240	So it turns out he was into pickup artistry.
2467240	2468240	Oh the game?
2468240	2469240	No no no.
2469240	2471240	The thing we know how men try to get into.
2471240	2472240	The game.
2472240	2473240	Sure.
2473240	2474240	Yeah.
2474240	2476240	Yeah there was a book that a guy wrote that's like.
2476240	2478240	It's a very specific thing.
2478240	2481240	He was into that but it didn't work for him.
2481240	2484240	So he was a member of this group that was called Pua Haters.
2484240	2485240	Or Pua hate or something.
2485240	2486240	What's Pua?
2486240	2487240	Wait Pua?
2487240	2488240	Pua's pickup artistry.
2488240	2489240	Oh.
2489240	2490240	Is what they refer.
2490240	2491240	I know right.
2491240	2492240	It already sounds gross.
2492240	2494240	That can be a thing.
2494240	2495240	Right.
2495240	2500240	So yeah so he's a member of this like this online community of people who hate pickup
2500240	2502240	artistry because it didn't work for them.
2502240	2506240	So they're like so now not only were they already angry at women they're now doubly angry because
2506240	2507240	these techniques just didn't work.
2507240	2509240	Yeah even science doesn't work.
2509240	2510240	Yeah exactly.
2510240	2511240	That's how awful women are.
2511240	2515240	Even the science of being just verbally abusive and deceptive to women.
2515240	2516240	Yeah.
2516240	2517240	Is that that friend zone thing?
2517240	2518240	Is that part of that?
2518240	2519240	I don't think so.
2519240	2521240	On Twitter there's a whole thing about like friend zone here.
2521240	2522240	I think that's separate.
2522240	2523240	I think friend zone.
2523240	2524240	Please correct me if I'm wrong.
2524240	2527640	I thought friend zoning was like no this is never going to happen you've never been friend
2527640	2528640	zoned.
2528640	2529640	Yeah.
2529640	2530640	Yeah.
2530640	2535960	And the men being mad at the idea that women could possibly send you to the I don't have
2535960	2540520	to fuck you cornfield like it's so crazy.
2540520	2544040	So so he got mad that there was a book that he read that didn't get him laid.
2544040	2547880	Right that didn't get him laid and then and then and then he was part of this group of
2547880	2548880	people.
2548880	2549880	Yeah.
2549880	2550880	Those three Chinese guys.
2550880	2556000	There was that he also hated he hated this is another part of it.
2556000	2561000	He's biracial and so he's half he's half I forget what kind of Asian but and half white
2561000	2563080	and he hated Asian guys.
2563080	2566800	And on message boards he'd be like you guys suck girls don't want you.
2566800	2571600	And he said that it was a spark Asian this that drove women away because women don't
2571600	2572600	like Asian.
2572600	2574480	He was racist against himself.
2574480	2575480	Well part of himself.
2576080	2577080	Yeah.
2577080	2580840	This guy had no shortage of a shortage of dick.
2580840	2581840	Yeah.
2581840	2587080	I mean it's not a brave stance to I mean whatever I don't know what we know that this guy's
2587080	2588080	a bad person.
2588080	2589080	Thank you.
2589080	2590080	Thank you.
2590080	2591080	Any.
2591080	2592760	That game stuff.
2592760	2593760	What was what was her name?
2593760	2599120	Did you get any any she had a night for the listeners in a pink sweater and a pink bow
2599120	2600120	in her hair.

2610760	2612240	I left my wallet.
2612240	2617840	Somebody somebody here came from New York and he was telling me outside that that Harman
2617840	2623440	town got him through Hurricane Sandy what because he didn't they didn't have any power
2623440	2627760	and they just had a bunch of podcasts on the computer and they would.
2627760	2633040	My question was like what if you didn't have power what did you said they would go to
2633040	2640160	an office or one of them worked I think and listen to Harman town through and it helped
2640160	2642040	him survive.
2642040	2646840	It would be so great if you asked who it was and it wasn't anybody you just like had like
2646840	2649800	in your head you made it up and bought it.
2649800	2651760	I was very politicians do that.
2651760	2653920	I talked to a plumber named Mike.
2653920	2654920	It was like that.
2654920	2662320	He's got three kids and Camille how's the.
2662320	2667000	We become a street celebrity now like from.

2690040	2691040	It's a good show.
2691640	2692640	Thank you.
2692640	2698800	So yeah every like now when you're free stuff when you read for that as I don't we haven't
2698800	2699800	talked about this.
2699800	2702680	When you read for that was that something that you thought that they had written kind
2702680	2705240	of for you or that you were just auditioning for it.
2705240	2710720	Well I didn't know I auditioned for two parts that I didn't get TJ's part TJ Miller or next
2710720	2716960	part and Big Hat and I didn't get him and this they just like the names.
2716960	2720920	They they said you're not right for these but we'll write something for you and you
2720920	2723960	always hear that whenever you have a good audition you don't get it don't worry we'll
2723960	2729200	write it for you and it's just like we'll see you never yeah or they'll bring the Chinese
2729200	2732520	food one episode you know.
2732520	2735480	But then they were like yeah we're gonna write something for you and I didn't hear anything
2735480	2740160	for a while and then the final round of auditions was happening and I was out of town and I
2740160	2744160	was like I got to fly back early but I couldn't fly back early so I was like all right I'm
2744160	2747680	gonna miss the final round of auditions and then I landed and I had this phone call that
2747680	2752360	was all my agents and manager and everybody and I was like oh this is something and they
2752360	2759160	said that you they wrote a part for you and that we I'm gonna be in the show and it was
2759160	2763600	I did one audition just with Mike and from that like I didn't have to do like the whole
2763600	2768880	round of testing and shit I did one audition with Mike judge and then oh really you didn't
2768880	2775200	have to do that fucking horrible thing where people go it was HBO let some kind of like
2775200	2778240	do their own thing so Mike was like oh I like this coming to write something for they're
2778240	2781880	like okay great if you like them use them fucking awesome it was awesome it was the
2781880	2786760	easiest like wasn't the easiest job to get I was fucking terrified going into the audition
2786760	2791400	because it's Mike judge and you know it must be Carolyn Strauss right the the she must
2791400	2798760	be some kind of mad genius because she's been there forever at HBO and HBO plays this really
2798760	2806720	high-risk high-yield game and television they bet all that they have on shows hoping
2806720	2812960	that they become Game of Thrones Sopranos because their money is made from subscription
2812960	2817760	they don't give a fuck about ratings they give it care they want people to buy the product
2817760	2823240	and they have to actually make they have to create cultural phenomena yeah there's a business
2823240	2827280	they have the buying is so much bigger it's not just a shoot that people aren't just giving
2827280	2831560	them a half hour of their time people are giving them you know 20 bucks a month or whatever
2831560	2836360	so you have to create shows that like become part of to make people on the subway start
2836360	2843120	to just get humiliated that they don't know what game of Thrones you have to make people
2843120	2848680	you have to bully people into like okay fine if I can subscribe to this yeah I'm so tired
2848680	2856480	of hearing about these dragons yeah for me the wire was like that yeah I mean though you
2856480	2861480	haven't seen the wire I'm gonna watch it just like don't ever have to hear that said HBO has
2861480	2865800	been in that business for decades now and successfully like that and it's like that's
2865800	2871280	not at all all the other networks they're like oh we'll make 20 pilots and then we'll you know
2871280	2875920	no no we'll be bad other than the one that's good also made ten one out of ten won't make
2875920	2881720	it past six episodes and it's like this ridiculous fuck off like frog eggs being laid knowing that
2881720	2886920	they're all gonna be eaten Dan you should like I mean you know you should do like an HBO kind of
2886920	2894520	thing like a scripted like like myth mythological maybe my child will perhaps that's what I what I'm
2894520	2901560	what I'm gearing up to yeah I would like my child to have an overall deal at HBO but that is so
2901560	2906440	interesting because the it's the opposite approach like networks like you said frog eggs at the HBO
2906440	2912240	they've got like a hundred million dollars in the first season of Game of Thrones yeah they
2912240	2915720	would have been out a hundred million or they didn't know what they were doing that would be
2915720	2921280	a horrible mistake but they did with and they ran out of money on deadwood right they couldn't
2921280	2925680	finish the season because it was too expensive is that what it was right I thought it was like
2925680	2931360	milch got busy and like bored I thought that they did they just like ran out of dough well it's
2931360	2936680	what HBO has done uh-huh Rome Rome I never saw it let's let's get some of these television
2936680	2952800	questions answered by entertainment expert Spencer Crittenden Master of Dungeons and
2953760	2961440	television industry gossip I love the way they talk like when they say on deadline with their
2961440	2969440	like thesp or Helver I love I can't read that stuff oh yeah it makes me feel so tiny because
2969440	2975720	everything being reduced to like this actual industry like it makes me it makes me nervous
2975720	2981840	whenever I I've been in a waiting room and I see the variety on the table I'm like fuck and I kind
2981840	2986400	of like glance at some of the headlines and I go ah it kind of it's like a it's like walking
2986400	2992480	through a casino like all of a sudden you're I don't know I got this far by denial of the world
2992480	2998040	around me like I just do what I do and then I read these headlines and I go I want an overall deal
2998040	3003320	yeah I want I want I want to I want eleven million dollars from scribe pen helm Laffer
3003320	3010080	script or a scrippy I want to be one of these guys I want I want to I want a photo that doesn't
3010280	3018400	look like I have yellow teeth and tiny hands some of those you can't control my hand size is always
3018400	3024360	gonna be no I met the other stuff yeah Spencer what do you think about the television industry
3024360	3037520	yeah deadwood too expensive no television industry that's an it exists Jesus Christ he's high I just
3037520	3042680	think that reality shows are bad every time someone watches or every time anyone mentions a
3042680	3048000	reality show by name I always like go through this mental process like Jesus Christ someone
3048000	3053840	watches reality shows oh yeah they're very popular a lot of people like those Jesus Christ
3053840	3058640	I'm talking to someone who watches reality shows but you're not counting Project Runway right
3058640	3065560	yeah I can't well I mean that was that was that was different to this actual skill merit base
3065560	3069640	those people are trying to be good and it's usually a pretty positive show Erin just started
3069640	3077280	binge-watching Project Runway and I now know I'm starting to learn about fashion I think tell me
3077280	3086080	what you know about fashion this is what I know if if your outfit can be compared to a pop cultural
3086080	3094840	reference it's bad so if a gay man can look at what you're wearing and and and and and reasonably
3094840	3101400	compare it to Pac-Man or strawberry shortcake if you can say anything while you're looking at it
3101400	3105960	that like that makes everyone go ah it's it's sort of like it's it's just like playing the
3105960	3111480	dozens fashion like it's it's like like the person comes out and then it's like the bad outfit is the
3111480	3118120	one that it's too evocative of like like I don't know I I'm looking at this she seems like a housewife
3118120	3124360	from Tron yeah and then fucking you're eliminated you're gone it's also like every time that that
3124360	3129280	one guy I don't know who the guy is I love that I love that Tim Gunn guy I don't know why that's
3129280	3136480	great but then there's the other guy I'm gesturing I'm gesturing with my hands just do a just do a
3136480	3143760	face to mime a giant head that's that one guy he's the guy that what's his name Michael that's
3143760	3151000	Michael Kors okay if if he if he can say that your outfit looks like blank then you're fucked
3151000	3158240	it's interesting do any of his references go beyond the 80s like oh you hear a game of thrones
3158240	3165240	sometimes I get all of his references I always get all of them like yeah he looks at the thing
3165240	3171600	goes like Malek's like a like a lucky charms could you do his impression of me coming on stage like
3171720	3175760	the dress like I'm dressed I can't I can't really do an impression of him it'll just sound like a
3175760	3183600	homophobic like like like stereotype Tim Gunn I think I was doing pretty good on I can't give
3183600	3191280	give give Camille the Tim Gunn treatment wait no I don't want that I just got really there five
3191280	3202880	minutes designers I'm I have to tell you I'm starting to get very concerned okay so this is
3202880	3211280	an average a line is she thin-waisted your model oh she's high-waisted well then you're okay you're
3211280	3216480	gonna put the shawl on well that's a relief I have to tell you I'm very excited about this keep
3216560	3224880	keep going keep doing what you're doing he is like that he is like that it's interesting
3224880	3229200	cuz Emily watches that show and I was like fuck this show and then I watched like three episodes
3229200	3236960	later I'm like yeah we know you can drape Rami show us something new like I know what they're
3236960	3243760	gonna say before they say it it's also interesting how far down the list being wearable is in their
3243760	3248800	criteria like when they say oh and that's wearable you hear that once every three episodes yeah it's
3248800	3254320	like it's made out of tires and the model is holding the hem because if she lets go she'll
3254320	3260960	be naked yeah I love what you did it's bold it's dangerous it's aggressive it's like a random
3260960	3266000	adjectives if all I can come up with is random adjectives that sound like you're describing like
3266000	3274160	a car aggressive yeah it's a ruby it's suspicious it's it's swarthy I love it it's impeccable
3275200	3280800	but if they can say oh boy it looks like Popeye's going to the spaghetti factory
3286160	3289280	I mean I am what I am but this is not what I am
3289280	3299200	I love that you guys both have girlfriends or wives watch that show it's a great show
3300240	3304560	I mean watching quotes man I'm sitting there I'm playing Wolfenstein on my laptop
3304560	3308640	hey Wolfenstein is pretty good right yeah I'm loving it yeah I've been playing that too
3308640	3313520	it's a fun game what do you what do you get Wolfenstein baby Spencer no I don't I don't I
3313520	3319280	don't game on my laptop but you're aware of Wolfenstein oh of course
3321280	3327040	it's the premier Nazi shooting game that's exactly right it's an anti-nazi game what did
3327040	3332000	German people feel like when they when they buy that game the German version actually is kind of
3332000	3337440	different they have like not swastikas and stuff it's all like censored and stuff are you joking
3337440	3342720	no yeah they hate swastikas over there now yeah the Nazis have these little eagle insignias or
3342720	3348560	something like that well just just because of the actual visual like the the image of a swastika
3348560	3352960	is like the n-word like it's just oh yeah that's inflammatory oh yeah it's not it's not like the
3352960	3358480	Germans don't know that you're watching German soldiers get knifed in the face I think they get
3358480	3363920	it and it's like it's a it's such a brutal like it's oh yeah they get knife in the face sometimes
3363920	3368640	Tyler's raising his hand I don't know whether it's cultural or actually there is something
3368960	3373360	you aren't allowed to have like swastikas you know what it's like I think it's like I
3373360	3380240	smoked so much for so many years and then I quit and now that I uh whenever I smell smoke I get like
3380240	3385840	queasy I think that's how they are with swastikas no I know that I I'm yeah I know that they were
3385840	3392320	like we were way into it that was interesting I know oh yeah when I drink gin if I taste gin
3392320	3400080	yeah yeah yeah yeah I had a horrible jager night one night and I could never that's how they are
3400080	3404720	with swastikas I immediately could pictures picture the playground where I puked my guts out
3404720	3411200	like I drank a bottle of gin because it was the only thing in the on a playground well I was it
3411200	3416640	wasn't like I was like I wasn't I wasn't there as a student I was it was a playground in a park near
3416640	3422000	my that's way worse you're a grown man drinking gin looking at children playing I was not a grown man
3422000	3428480	and I wasn't watching children play it was night time oh way better it was an abandoned playground
3429680	3435280	night time oh good where where do you want me to go the Russian tea room or what am I supposed to
3435280	3443760	drink gin when I'm 15 uh no I know I know the Germans are pulled to 180 for sure I mean they
3443760	3448720	but I'm saying like I wonder how they feel when they because we meanwhile like we don't
3449680	3455120	it's it's it's kind of a funny thing like in this in this world of like like like hey don't
3455120	3459680	watch what you say and how you do it and this long-standing thing that's been accepted as a way
3459680	3465200	of expressing ourselves like let's let's take a second look at that and uh we're definitely like
3465200	3471600	never gonna you can always just have you know just show like Nazis and then just fucking like
3471600	3477040	stab them in the eyes and go like you fucking Nazi cocksucker fucking fucker you fucking
3477040	3482240	Nazi piece of shit um even whether it's just a guy taking a pee like in this game you're just
3482240	3487440	like you just you know I mean like like they're they're just soldiers walking around like like
3487440	3493040	and there's actual actual that was their references to their wives and families like
3493040	3498080	like it's like a joke how cruel it is like there's there's you're listening to them talk about their
3498080	3503040	what my wife is yeah like this is a good job for me I haven't actually killed anybody and then you
3503200	3508400	fucking like slit their throat and like drink their blood because you know they're Nazis and
3508400	3513680	I just went I just I just I just picture like a German 16 year old buying the game and being like
3513680	3519840	man I fucking I didn't know what any of this is about man I was like yeah I really got handed
3519840	3528240	a fucking fucking lot of karma there's a lot of baggage it's so fucking weird to
3528240	3531840	it's also interesting that in games when they want to be super violent they just made the bad
3531840	3537120	guys Nazis because then you could do anything to them and everyone's kind of on board I mean is it
3538080	3544960	is it trite or inflammatory to point out that that's a very naziistic way of dealing with our
3546240	3552880	our feelings about things like that you pick a scapegoat and you yeah you make them the other
3552880	3559280	and then you fucking murder like British people or Russians are always our bad guys in films
3559280	3565840	because there there are the other our foe like our xenophobic bullshit like Germany like
3567600	3573920	when the Nazi party came to power they didn't have the majority they got they got like a lot
3573920	3579360	of the vote and and Hitler became the chancellor a lot of people didn't like the Nazi party when
3579360	3586320	they became powerful there was the SA and the SD and this police force that if you didn't like them
3586320	3591360	you were sent to a fucking concentration camp and if you're intellectual if you were smart
3591360	3597440	Jewish gay like like lots of other interesting things uh you you were simply pushed away
3598400	3604960	most of Germany like most of Europe at that time very anti-semitic like there was lots of countries
3604960	3611920	oh sure yeah like like Jews weren't uh welcome in most countries back then that's fucking terrifying
3611920	3616560	man when you the history high school history books like they always just you know they throw
3616560	3621840	that aside like it's always just this formula with dictatorships is that is that that stage
3621840	3627600	where they round up the intellectuals yeah they round up the doctors and the like like everyone
3627600	3632960	in this room is fucking dead yeah that's like like if if some shit goes down in this country
3632960	3637600	like the economy collapses and then there's like this you know this is this is what happens like
3637600	3643920	economic uh turmoil is the potting soil for fascism um because because some guy in a uniform
3643920	3647040	is going to come out and he's going to tell everybody in the mainstream that they're going
3647040	3652720	to be safe as long as we make our new business blowing shit up yeah and uh and and and that is
3652720	3658080	exactly what happens over and over and over again and then i'm gone i'm i'm in the first fucking
3658080	3663120	bus out for whatever reason in my head you guys know uh jeff foxworthy's uh you might be a rat
3664000	3668080	i can just in my head i was like you might be a dictator like if you're rounding up all the
3668080	3676720	intellectuals you might be a dictator if you think reason is a reasonable thing
3677840	3681840	you might be a dictator you might be a dictator also they called it fascism they called it
3681840	3686480	dictatorships and people were cool with that like like that was a thing well but that was an
3686880	3694240	back then it wasn't a bad also also women absolutely marginalized women were simply
3694240	3695280	stop trying to get laid
3699120	3702240	stop trying to make my feminism about me getting laid
3703920	3708800	the misogynist cold cheese now you're calling yourself a feminist you really are trying to get
3708800	3718800	laid also like there was some fucking fucking fuck with on on on internet that said that because
3718800	3726720	like this is like a fucking andy-rooney rant right now somebody's like like jeff hates men
3726720	3732160	it's like no i i said a nice thing about women and that like that's me being like anti-men like
3732160	3740720	that's fucked up like men need to grow the fuck up and start like i i'm not trying to be sexy i'm
3740720	3746080	not trying to get laid but i'm not trying to be sexy this shit comes naturally
3748400	3756160	it's just how i am man misogynist i just make feminism look good also also there should be
3756160	3758960	more women in our show how about that there should be there should be a guy
3760320	3767600	what do you think is she's three fucking i agree women yay no it's jeff you were like
3768240	3772400	there was a you know there's a tragic shooting not too long ago but jeff's like
3772400	3778960	there's a guy who says i hate men that's fucked up yeah that's that's that's what's fucked up
3779040	3780080	incredibly fucked up
3783760	3788240	we live in a world where women aren't people they're objects person people second so that's
3788240	3795040	fucking crazy it's absolutely crazy uh i like your thing that i think we're gonna like disagree with
3795040	3801280	you i don't know man maybe they should be but but hey that's absolutely i know i hear what you're
3801280	3806080	saying i like the idea let me play devil's advocate here i'm not trying to be provocative
3806960	3810800	i'm just saying that's the case it's a fucking this it's absolutely i like the idea of going
3810800	3815680	with that thought and seeing how long you could go with it until the women stop clapping because
3815680	3820000	you would you would go like we live in a world where women are objects first they're animals
3820000	3825440	they're pieces of shit they're human garbage no one gives a fuck about women you see what he's
3825440	3830640	doing ladies you see what he's doing and you just keep going until the women are like like
3830640	3835200	legally would be like like yay yay and then after a while they're like wait wait a minute he's
3835200	3842720	thought about this too much this feels prepared how many women does it take to screw the light bulb
3842720	3848560	for god's sake you're doing exactly what i was talking about as a feminist i i i wonder why it's
3848560	3855040	three instead of one that's not even a thing you can say dad you're just naturally being
3855040	3862160	misogynist right now it's a natural thing uh i uh as with alcoholism and racism i will i will agree
3862160	3871040	first so that uh people stop accusing me i know i want i want the conversations about whether
3871040	3878640	you're an ism uh the the big secret is fucking say yes i am yeah and then it's done because then
3878640	3885840	what are they going to do help you they're not putting in that elbow grace you're racist you're
3885840	3893280	racist okay i'm racist yeah what are we going to do about this uh you're you're racist
3894800	3900160	and i am i am going over there for a drink to tell other people that you're racist
3900160	3904240	that's what like that's the approach like jennifer lawrence who's awesome who is it like a ton of
3904240	3908880	stuff coming out and before she was like there's gonna be a backlash soon and it's just gonna be
3908880	3912960	fine and then because she said that people were like well now we can't do the backlash because
3913920	3919040	you told us that's what we were gonna do it's the best thing to do you just got it like you're
3919040	3932400	right let's bring up race and gender expert dimorge brown and soccer expert

4788240	4793440	there they relieved themselves and met with fliz dam a scared but friendly chap and after
4793440	4800480	calming him down he revealed he was a member of a secret order the seekers of paradise and took our
4800480	4806880	heroes to meet with this order after a tense introduction introduction charles hoffman revealed
4806880	4813520	an ancient relic recovered from ruins quark heartily activated the relic by pressing red
4813520	4820080	and opened a deadly and consuming vortex that sucked our party to the magical isle of paradise
4820080	4824640	there they met yo miji the guardian over paradise who demanded our heroes determine
4824640	4830720	their worth by telling a joke and quark did so and told a great joke but would it cause
4830720	4834160	yo miji to raffle as ao let's find out
4842640	4849440	i guess strictly speaking it did already in the past last time on harman town he chuckled
4849440	4856240	he was chuckling and he said that's a nice joke yeah he did do that all right so so are we in
4856240	4862320	the isle of paradise you stand in the unfiltered sunlight on the floating isle of paradise green
4862320	4869120	grass and gorgeous flowers and plants all in bloom coat the island which is bordered by fluffy
4869120	4876000	white clouds adrift in the sky you feel life and vibrance all around you and hear the rolling
4876000	4882480	laughter of the massive angel rolling around on the ground he finishes laughing and gets up
4882480	4889120	and grabs his flaming shovel he lights a cigarette and starts smoking it you know you know where the
4889120	4896400	tarragon of virtue is that's our objective tarragon of virtue we're looking for it yeah yeah you guys
4896400	4902720	seem pretty worthy uh this is a good joke man this is a good joke man yeah what was the joke
4902800	4908320	the uh welder's mask the what i'll tell it i'll tell it
4910240	4916640	what was the joke sharpie sharpie tell the welders his kid finds a welder's mask and then he's like
4916640	4920480	walking around with him he's like oh what an interesting welder's mask and then a pickup
4920480	4926720	truck comes by and the pickup driver says why is that pickup truck it wasn't it's just a guy in
4926720	4933200	a car but he's painting a specific picture the board has a red solo cup this is a pickup truck
4933200	4939840	all right and he goes like hey kid do you do you want to ride and the kid goes like uh flips up
4939840	4945200	the welder's mask goes uh yeah sure i could use a ride the welder's mask is heavy so
4948240	4955520	even even though i walked this far now like like now i'm encumbered so so gets in the car truck
4955520	4963760	van and uh and they start driving and the driver says uh hey hey kid uh you uh do you do you like
4967040	4974640	that's my fault do you do you like candy uh kid flips up the mask it's like yeah i like i like
4974640	4983680	candy it's like flips the mask down this is the joke you know i told i told it right the driver
4983680	4990720	says uh hey kid do you do you know what uh fallatio is how old is this kid flips up the mask and he's
4990720	5000720	like six and uh and he says uh says no no no i don't flip some mask down and uh and then the
5000720	5011360	the driver says uh hey kid do you know what uh what uh uh sodomy is and uh and the kid flips a
5011360	5020560	mask up it says uh uh and uh and then the driver says hey kid do you know what a pedophile is
5020560	5025360	and the kid flips up the mask exasperated and says look i gotta be honest with you sir i'm not
5025360	5037840	a real welder pretty good he has to keep flipping the mask up and down right isn't that a thing
5038720	5043200	no i like it has to work in threes you made it work in fours so what what happens with the
5043200	5050400	kid i'm worried because that kid is still with the pedophile the kid wins i like i like it
5050400	5055200	the kid wins this guy's like oh this kid oh you're not a real welder and then he drops him off
5059840	5065760	is that how it ends he just wants to fuck kid welders mr mr i gotta be honest with you i'm
5065760	5073120	not really a welder the end uh the guy goes okay for the kid yeah no yeah for everybody
5075120	5081120	not forever the kid wins that is the kid wins yeah how does the kid wins by by being uh guileless
5082560	5087920	the kid kid the kid gets a chuckle in before he before he's taken back to uh
5088720	5092720	the basement later i like this i like the thing the guy goes oh i'll tell you why i've been
5092720	5099440	outsmarted uh i'll drop you off here i've been outsmarted he's not outsmarted he's been out dumped
5100560	5105600	yeah same thing yeah so the guy is not turned on by the kid anymore no because he
5108480	5114240	he he wanted a fucking welder he wanted a welder he's nothing like kids he wanted to
5114240	5120640	fuck a welder yes and the kid says he was acting he was like sir you're off the hook i'm not a welder
5121600	5128000	so it turns out the guy really was on the prowl for child welders he wanted to fuck a young welder
5128880	5133360	i like to think that it was just any welder and it was kind of hurting him that it was a kid because
5133360	5137920	he knows that's wrong yeah he just was like the kid didn't know what fellatio and salmi was you
5137920	5143760	know oh i'm gonna repeat this kid i'm confused about the part where he asks him if he knows
5143760	5148960	what a pedophile is like like why how why is he asking him how is any answer to that question
5149920	5154960	taking a hint he's saying look look like like let's let's uh let's put our cards in the table
5156320	5162000	so do you think he was hoping the kid would say i i do know what one is and i'm into it
5164080	5168960	not only do i know what a pedophile is i'm all for it right and he goes good then we're all
5169520	5174800	but what kind of kid that's into pedophiles doesn't know what fellatio is yeah a welder
5174800	5181840	all right all right come on now all right what sorry spencer no i'm having a great time
5184000	5189600	i just think the joke's a real bummer it's it doesn't it does you leave the world you pull
5189600	5194800	your camera pulls out of that truck pickup truck van why is it a truck it's a car it's a cart i
5194800	5200240	always pictured it as a as an orange pickup truck that's good that makes you rapey with propane
5200240	5206960	tanks in the bag why because he's got a day job he's not just he's gonna he's going to get his
5206960	5213040	propane tanks refilled and and along the way you know a successful pedophile doesn't like uh
5214400	5219920	doesn't put all his eggs in pedophilia his basket like he doesn't he it's not a job he's gonna he's
5219920	5224400	gonna he's gonna make it a side mission you know like in grand theft auto it's like yeah it's like
5224400	5229040	a bonus mission yeah it's like he's got an a-story going on he's got got a whole he's getting married
5229280	5232320	i don't know i think if you're a pedophile that is your a-story
5233520	5240000	i well i mean you know it'll all it'll all be uh revealed in my new movie daedalus

6108720	6113920	blowing runes light up on the bows surface as you surface as you whisper in elvish and then
6113920	6120720	you quickly knock and loose four arrows in rapid succession three of which sink into the uh you
6120720	6129040	know i was gonna call it a gnome but it's more of a ghost skin flesh a skin free orlando blimp
6131760	6138080	one of them manage or one of them just kind of goes through it like a like a like an arrow through
6138080	6145600	ghost but the other two sink into its ghostly flesh and cause it to bleed ectoplasm taking

6196800	6203120	because he was inside me for so i'm not a welder and then i stab him
6210640	6215200	stabbing him with your words at the same time your knife plunges in and
6215840	6220880	poison courses through its blade into his ghostly form and he takes six damage
6220880	6229760	and also is poisoned oh he's poisoned no he wasn't flanked ghosts can't be flanked
6230720	6234720	maybe they can i don't know let's debate it who is he
6236720	6242000	whose turn is it if you've flanked a ghost call into harmontown one eight hundred
6243680	6246640	three six six harmon it's probably too many numbers
6246640	6253600	uh they do that sometimes where it's too long but it just starts dying but if you're an idiot
6253600	6259440	you keep like pressing the numbers it used to be like yeah harm three six six harm it's uh the
6259440	6266400	ghost's turn oh shit it uh it it screams and squeals again and then it kind of starts to shimmer
6266400	6273120	and vibrate its form becomes more immaterial and hazy as it does and then it shoots it shoots
6273120	6282160	directly towards uh charles hoffman great oh i think i can't get a break yeah dodge that bullet
6283200	6291920	and uh enters his body and he goes oh no oh god and then his arms start moving about and he's like
6293760	6296800	this is cool and then he goes
6297520	6305760	oh boy and he casts black magic and uh black tentacles of evard
6305760	6314720	sprout forth from the ground and try to grab at your legs oh that one does that one doesn't
6317120	6324800	not one doesn't okay so quark is uh grappled by these tentacles i can't the rest of you
6324800	6332400	can't get a break i can't either all right missing all well what we have to do is we have
6332400	6339600	to feed okay we have to feed tarragon to this new guy now oh you think so yeah because that's how
6339600	6347040	the thing comes out right all right then do it okay well it's not my turn though i pass really
6347040	6354320	yeah okay is there is there more tarragon or did we feed it all to you look more around with your
6354400	6360880	half elf eyes and your knowledge of what tarragon looks like and you see maybe about 15 feet off
6360880	6366960	there's some in the shade of a bacon bush all right there now i have to make one stop
6369520	6376160	tarragon grows in the shade of the bacon bush uh so then i i i rushed toward the bush
6377120	6383840	fending off this guy who wants the bacon uh and i rip up the tarragon what's there in clumps
6384400	6391920	you grab several clumps i rush back to the tentacle feed it to the uh chef shove it down
6391920	6399280	like it's a Charles Hoppin of this thing attacking me yes i have Charles Hoppin and i make him eat it
6401040	6405520	you try to make him he eat it he's he's wrestling you but you get him you get him
6405520	6410000	in a headlock and you just stuff a clump of tarragon into his mouth that's right
6414560	6421280	and uh he he also goes into a fetal vomiting position and and vomits uh the ghost up again
6421280	6425760	and the ghost starts screaming and making all sorts of a ruckus oh this ghost again all right
6425760	6432080	everybody yeah attack this ghost well also everybody grab a bunch of tarragon yeah just
6432080	6437520	i just have it in bushels around yeah just fill your pockets with tarragon did you bring any extra
6437520	6442880	did he have any extra he got several clumps worth oh all right i take one of the clumps i have a
6443520	6450880	bummed that my shocking grasp didn't work um but i'm not gonna let it get to me your hands are still
6450880	6459200	electricity yeah yep so use them well but it doesn't work on them yeah it doesn't work oh
6459200	6467200	can i ask you about bull's strength yeah is that a beer yeah it's a heffa fight
6467200	6476320	what is what is bull's strength they love heffa fighting was that a joke on like heifer
6476320	6485200	ball is that oh i guess it was you didn't know and you said that it's it was the most comedic
6485200	6491280	uh beer thing i could think of but it also worked as a pun yeah that's the way you get for not going
6491360	6500320	for lager uh what is bull's strength it gives one touched target 1d4 plus one strength yeah
6500320	6507840	oh don't give it to that guy yeah um i think i mean what we're doing is working i'm just gonna
6508480	6515600	attack this ghost yeah i'm gonna with isn't it poisoned also oh it's ghost poisoned um i
6516560	6521920	i take my short bow and i tie the poison dagger to the tip of it
6523040	6527120	and i whisper the same stuff that he whispered into his thing i'm like i don't know if that's
6527120	6534960	gonna work but here it comes so i say that too you said you tied it to your bow or you're
6534960	6540560	an arrow you know what i meant i mean it's an important distinction okay i want i call out to
6540640	6544320	yo michi to kill the uh to kill the ghost i'm on break
6550000	6558800	i tie it to the arrow that was beast egg bills uh i'm knee deep in utopia fruits what i i tied to
6558800	6566080	the arrow okay and i aim up above it but since i'm a master arrowsman what did you tie to the
6566080	6574800	arrow the poison dagger you tied a dagger to an arrow tie the poison dagger to my can i have that
6574800	6581840	oh what is the what is what is what is gonna happen the arrow is gonna go into him and the
6581840	6584400	dagger is gonna hurt him
6589040	6593760	oh and i put tarragon on it too on the arrow someone yelled this out
6593760	6599440	so i'm going right to the source with so i got i got an arrow i got the poison dagger on the
6599440	6603120	arrow i got tarragon on the it's like the turducken of weapons
6608160	6615040	that's a big cmb so you you arc you aim upwards to counterbalance the weight you're adding to
6615040	6622000	this arrow and you lose it from your bow and it plunks right into the heart of this ghost yeah
6624560	6630320	but but it slides through harmlessly and just impacts the soil and the paradise
6630320	6633280	below he seems completely unharmed somehow
6636320	6643520	uh can i draw my speedy longbow yep and i use my power to heat up metal to
6644640	6648960	warm the shafts of the blade the shafts of what the shafts of the arrows
6649200	6654560	uh the heads would be metal heads okay sure yeah you just warm my shaft
6656400	6664160	that comes later first i fire five at once i think you can only do three damn it without
6664160	6669200	the whispering well that was with the other whisper oh yeah you can only whisper once per day
6669200	6678640	can i shout until you lose your voice yeah so three hours yeah we good sure
6679920	6683920	i'm so that's it and that's right
6687120	6691520	all right two of your arrows miss but one hits them right in his ghost eye
6692880	6694720	it's a critical hit and he takes
6698480	6699680	23 damage
6702320	6703280	black paper
6709200	6715120	so i think quirk has a move yeah wait did you do yours i don't think you've done like that
6715120	6720480	whenever jim orange gets a victory we then we then take it away from him by ascribing it to all black
6720480	6725040	people no but i thought we were just doing it that every time something good happened no i know
6726720	6731120	i'm connecting the dots and i'm going like let the guy have a victory like
6731120	6735200	you're calling out black people every time he does something great you know it's it's really
6735200	6742400	it's really i i i go into a barbarian rage and barbarian rage and take my flaming sword
6742400	6749600	and attack the ghost all right flying into a barbarian rage rage settles over your face
6749600	6757520	and your body it's comfortable somehow that's probably why you're barbarian and you charge
6757520	6765760	directly at the ghost and slash with your great sword but uh yeah you don't hit oh shit
6766720	6773360	he seems to jump upwards or hover upwards or ghost dodge in some direction and he doesn't
6773360	6781600	take any damage from your sword instead he starts shimmering and vibrating again and squealing
6788320	6796960	and then he he flies away from you guys he goes straight past you straight towards yomiji
6799520	6804400	oh no we don't care that's fine no we do if he gets inside yomiji smacks him right in the
6804400	6811920	face with his ghostness and yomiji's like oh no why why don't we want we don't want to fight
6812000	6818000	yo he's in yomiji now we could we could just run away right he's the leader of the uh
6820800	6827760	he's the guardian of the fucking he's a giant yeah yeah this is the last time you interfere
6827760	6838080	with my plan grab tarragon we have more right we we all go grab tarragon with this form i will
6838080	6845680	annihilate you he says while you're grabbing extra tarragon can i use mage hand to force feed
6845680	6851680	tarragon to yomiji yeah that's that's what i want to try in my next trend
6854000	6858880	i'm gonna float the tarragon over yeah i'm gonna do the here comes the airplane
6858880	6868640	floating with your mage hand levitating this tarragon of virtue within the range of the spell
6868640	6874320	you you fly it up to his face and he pokes it with his flaming shovel and burns it to uh cinders
6875120	6876080	someone's cranky
6880160	6884880	we gotta fight this motherfucker yeah i mean we have to get tarragon into a system somehow
6885520	6892720	am i still in a rage yeah i i just go uh far sword flaming far sword at him from from a distance
6892720	6896240	wait you could you know we're not trying to feed him the food anymore no i'm gonna kill this
6896240	6902720	motherfucker you don't want to kill the angel guy get some get some goo tarragon goo on your
6902720	6908160	bleated weapons maybe yeah can i do that put it on an arrowhead or yeah i have a ribbon to tie your
6908160	6914560	knife to anything yes you're what was the attack you did uh flaming far sword flaming far sword
6914560	6919920	attack but you might have lost your footing or something jesus christ it goes it goes
6919920	6924960	downward and starts and it hits the ground and starts a fire on paradise
6928880	6935920	everything we touch turns to shit can i how much how much fire armor can i create uh you can create
6935920	6942080	plenty for yourself but none for other people well i create come on by myself black black

6971760	6977360	so you you you do that you tie it or you rub it or whatever and then you start whipping around
6977360	6984880	the assassin dagger to throw at your foe but it also goes awry i think you let it go a bit too
6984880	6990880	late when it's coming around and smacks you in the face jesus christ what i'm rolling a lot of
6990880	6996800	ones today so it doesn't hurt me that much that's good it hurts you for two damage when it's
