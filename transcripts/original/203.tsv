0	9000	From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, from the Nerd Male Theater, Harmon Town is
9000	16000	now in session.
16000	21000	Spencer Crittenden.
21000	24000	Spencer.
24000	27000	Gambling across the stage.
27000	34000	The mayor of Harmon Town, Dan Harmon.
34000	43000	Well, thank you, thank you.
43000	45000	Yeah, blips and chits.
45000	48000	That's my shirt.
48000	54000	Do you know that tomorrow would be our fourth anniversary of the first Harmon Town?
54000	63000	Yeah, it's the fourth anniversary, Dan.
63000	67000	How do we keep it so fresh after all these years?
67000	69000	Yeah, no, I have no idea.
69000	70000	I don't know.
70000	72000	That's going to be a bad show.
72000	77000	I've been having a very relaxing weekend, and you know how it gets.
77000	79000	You know, your energy flags a little bit.
79000	86000	You start playing your cookies, and that fucking Transformers game you're playing,
86000	91000	Transformers Earth Wars.
91000	94000	It's Clash of Clans with Transformers.
94000	96000	Jeff's playing it.
96000	99000	You don't have to play it, Dan.
99000	102000	Are you also playing Clash of Clans?
102000	105000	I think I'm starting to trail off on the Clash of Clans,
105000	110000	because now I get to be an Optimus Prime or a bumblebee.
110000	113000	I wanted to tell you guys, all I can really share with you
113000	120000	is the result of a good seven hours of forensic file viewing today.
120000	126000	I can tell you that pubic hairs travel or migrate.
126000	127000	I wrote that down.
127000	128000	That was so funny.
128000	130000	From room to room.
130000	132000	I noticed that they reused...
132000	134000	By their own volition?
134000	136000	Do they have to hitch a ride on time?
136000	140000	That's why I think they use the phrase travel or migrate,
140000	144000	because they said to either travel or migrate the first time by itself,
144000	148000	and then they're like, people are going to think they're alive like worms.
148000	152000	But I saw the episode where they really walked you through
152000	161000	finding out that pubic hairs travel or migrate to different rooms.
162000	164000	Wait, tell me more about pubic hair migration.
164000	167000	Tell me more about your weird friend.
171000	174000	You saw him too?
174000	177000	A fellow. What is your name, good sir?
177000	178000	Luke.
178000	179000	Thank you, brother.
179000	184000	He just spirited me up a little airport bottle of Fernet Branca,
184000	188000	to which I say, hooray and hurrah.
188000	192000	Which I will now drink on podcast form.
198000	204000	So, there was a case where there were these dead children.
209000	212000	Don't mention dead children around, Jeff.
212000	216000	There were these dead children and they wanted to know who killed them.
216000	219000	And there were pubic hairs, of course, everywhere.
219000	223000	And the pubic hairs matched this guy who lived with the family.
223000	228000	I'm not laughing at the death of the children.
228000	229000	I'm just laughing.
229000	230000	We don't know that.
230000	234000	It's just like the volume of forensic files, it just desensitizes you.
234000	237000	That's what you're in the market for, desensitization.
237000	241000	You keep making these jokes about people's haircuts and stuff,
241000	243000	and they're crying.
243000	245000	And there's just pubic hairs everywhere.
245000	247000	And they were like, well, fuck.
247000	249000	Well, the guy lived with them.
249000	253000	They're like, dude, we found your pubic hairs in the kid's room.
253000	255000	And the guy's like, so?
255000	257000	Fucking, I lived there.
257000	260000	Pubic hairs get around.
260000	262000	He's got to be right, right?
262000	266000	And that's the funny guy.
266000	271000	This forensics guy, he's doing his interview and he goes,
271000	272000	so?
272000	275000	We had to come up with a new science.
275000	279000	And so I went home and I vacuumed my whole house really well.
279000	282000	And I tell you, the house has never been cleaner.
282000	283000	And he stopped.
283000	290000	I was like, that guy's one moment of joy that whole year.
290000	295000	But he vacuumed his whole house, and then he vacuumed it regular times
295000	297000	and counted the pubic hairs.
297000	300000	He had to figure out how.
300000	304000	Can you imagine being that guy's daughter?
304000	309000	What are you doing, dad?
309000	312000	The guy is in the middle of a science that needs to be like,
312000	314000	it's got peer review and stuff.
314000	317000	So he's at home and he's like, this could help bring a murderer to justice.
317000	321000	And it's like, I need to make sure that I don't while eating breakfast
321000	326000	or watching television or anything, I never engage in any activities
326000	331000	that go beyond the average amount of pubic hair affectation.
331000	337000	I don't want to have a crazy dance party
337000	340000	and take off my pants and shake my pelvis around,
340000	344000	because what if they find that out?
344000	348000	Because he had to find out how far does the average pubic hair go.
348000	355000	And it turns out pubic hairs travel or migrate, primarily on sock surfaces.
355000	363000	You step on a pubic hair, you're smuggling pubes at that point.
363000	367000	But more than the hairs off your head or hairs off your arm?
367000	371000	No, no, not more than hairs off your head, no.
371000	373000	Just enough that there's some pubic hairs.
373000	377000	If you have a kid, some of your pubic hairs are in your kid's bedroom,
377000	379000	but not so many.
379000	382000	And then they started getting into the minutia of like,
382000	388000	yeah, but these were fresh, moist pubic hairs.
388000	390000	But those stick to socks more than any other type.
390000	397000	And then the forensics guy was talking about how the pubic hairs he was finding in his kid's bedroom
397000	404000	were dry and had been bitten by a mite larvae, you know?
404000	409000	But the world this guy lives in, the world his children live in.
409000	420000	But this pubic hair was holding a picture of today's New York Times.
420000	422000	Was he acquitted? This guy can offer it.
422000	427000	The guy that works for the forensics, I think that he went to jail after that the whole thing was over.
427000	429000	His kids like filed charges.
429000	433000	I was trying to save a life. No, everyone's dead.
433000	436000	You're just trying to be the best pubic hair detector.
436000	445000	And you need to stop. It's like a beautiful mind, I think.
445000	448000	That's hard work being the world's best pubic hair detective.
448000	450000	It's faithless work.
450000	454000	Oh, and I was also thinking because, okay, so while he was talking about the pubic hair migration,
454000	459000	he was like, you saw this black and white footage of people, their heads were out of frame,
459000	463000	but you just saw it like, it was like a locked down camera shot
463000	468000	and then just like different family members, like different aged people putting on socks
468000	474000	and taking them off and like walking around and like just walking through frame.
474000	478000	And then there was another case that it was pubic hair reliant.
478000	482000	And so they used that footage again.
482000	487000	And Cody and I were like, oh my God, it's the pubic hair migration footage.
487000	491000	And then also that required vacuuming.
491000	493000	And it was like, oh, that's the same vacuum cleaner.
493000	496000	Oh, they were cutting up and looking through the layers of the vacuum bag.
496000	502000	So I was thinking like they must be so stoked at forensic files when a new murder happens
502000	506000	and it uses all the elements of their stock footage.
506000	508000	Their budget's cut in half.
508000	513000	Someone got strangled with pubic hair by a vacuum cleaner salesman.
513000	516000	But then you get a guy that it's like a producer that was about to get fired
516000	519000	and he starts committing pubic hair murders.
519000	523000	Just to drive the budget down.
523000	527000	It's like firemen starting fires.
527000	529000	Yeah, exactly.
529000	532000	Yeah, the forensics files budget is too high.
532000	535000	I don't know about, well, yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
535000	538000	He starts committing non-pubic hair murders.
538000	539000	That's what it is.
539000	543000	The network says, look, your show's on autopilot, man.
543000	545000	Budgetarily, you've got it all knocked out.
545000	546000	I can do it.
546000	547000	You take the pubic hair footage.
547000	548000	You take the bloody knife.
548000	550000	You take the lady coming home from shopping.
550000	555000	And you put this thing together, you say murder.
555000	557000	And then you get an episode.
557000	560000	And then the producer was like, fuck, there goes my kid's pool.
560000	564000	He was building his kid his own pool.
564000	575000	So he removes all of his pubic hair and becomes the alopecia strangler.
575000	577000	And then there's an episode about it.
578000	583000	It's like a cool movie about that guy's double life.
583000	585000	And you're on his side because it's like a black comedy,
585000	589000	like a dark anti-kind of thing.
589000	591000	How do you catch the alopecia strangler?
591000	593000	What's that forensic files like?
593000	594000	Well, he slips up.
594000	595000	I don't know.
595000	597000	He gets caught by his own people.
597000	600000	Nobody on those shows, by the way, they never get caught by the cops.
600000	604000	It's always the drinking game with forensic files.
604000	607000	The big one is like, and then police received a call
607000	609000	that they've been waiting for.
609000	612000	Then police received a tip that changed everything.
612000	614000	A guy just told me he is the alopecia strangler.
614000	616000	It's always like a guy in prison that's like, hey,
616000	619000	this guy I'm in prison with murdered like 90 people
619000	624000	before you caught him jaywalking.
624000	627000	And then they let the three people they put in prison for the crime go
627000	630000	at the end and they're all gold and gray
630000	632000	and they fall down as they're leaving the prison
632000	638000	from the weight of the $8 they got from the state.
638000	639000	Dan, have you ever had...
639000	640000	There was like a crazy one where I was like,
640000	643000	I kept rewinding it because I was like, wait, are they trying to...
643000	646000	This episode of forensic files is trying to get away with murder
646000	654000	because there was a woman in it who went to police and said,
654000	657000	I think I know, like I work at a massage parlor
657000	660000	and a lot of these guys get pretty chatty like they,
660000	664000	like, and I think I, you know, this is guys like saying some weird shit.
664000	666000	Like I'd wear a wire for you if you wanted.
666000	669000	And they were like, no, that's too dangerous.
669000	673000	And then she called them later and was like,
673000	676000	yeah, that guy just confessed.
676000	677000	I should have been wearing a wire.
677000	679000	And they're like, okay, well, can you...
679000	683000	Okay, now record them and get them to do it again.
683000	685000	And she tried and it didn't work.
685000	688000	And then the guy came and stabbed her after work.
688000	691000	And I was like, oh, so rewind it to when she was...
691000	694000	Like, that's why they made that big weird deal about how she came to them.
694000	697000	It was like, gee, we told her it's too dangerous.
697000	698000	Like, no, you didn't.
698000	702000	You fucking jumped on it and made her some amateur sleuth or whatever, man.
702000	706000	So it was like, come on, man, forensic files,
706000	708000	not forensic files, the police involved.
708000	712000	Forensic files, I'm sure they killed people too.
712000	715000	You know if it made the difference between them getting to do more forensic files
715000	720000	and getting canceled that they'd kill somebody.
720000	726000	If that show tells you one thing, man, it's inside all of us.
726000	729000	You released the Beast.
729000	732000	We watched the Purge movies this weekend.
732000	736000	All two of the ones available at home.
736000	739000	Purge 2, definitely better than Purge 1.
739000	742000	It's a lot like a, you know, this is a turds with peanuts in them
742000	745000	are better than regular turds.
745000	749000	But the Purge, just because I don't know what you're measuring,
749000	752000	I mean, measuring by peanuts, it's gross.
752000	753000	It's a gross image.
753000	755000	You don't want to think about it, but technically speaking, oh.
755000	758000	Spencer, if you had to choose between turds or turds of peanuts,
758000	759000	what are you taking?
759000	761000	Are people swallowing these peanuts whole?
761000	763000	How does that work?
763000	764000	You got to chew those peanuts.
764000	765000	Yeah.
765000	768000	How would you tell the difference between any other thing
768000	770000	that was in your poop?
770000	772000	They would taste like peanuts.
772000	774000	You wouldn't say it's like...
774000	775000	It's just one of those things.
775000	776000	It's like corn.
776000	777000	Corn is cellulose.
777000	778000	It doesn't digest.
778000	779000	Corn is different than peanuts, man.
779000	781000	That's what I'm saying.
781000	782000	Whatever.
782000	784000	I didn't get a lot of sleep.
784000	787000	Let me tell you what happened when I was trying to go to sleep last night.
787000	789000	Okay, great.
789000	790000	I was going to go to sleep.
790000	792000	I'm laying down, laying down in my bed.
792000	794000	I'm relaxing.
794000	800000	I got to fart, and I fart, and I just shit all over the place.
800000	803000	Just so much shit.
803000	808000	I'm like lightheaded, and I'm getting dizzy from all the shit,
808000	812000	and I can't move, and I'm just paralyzed.
812000	818000	You shit so much, you depleted your blood flow to your brain.
818000	820000	Yeah, it was terrifying.
821000	825000	And then I woke up, and it was sleep paralysis,
825000	828000	and I was completely dry, but it was really terrifying
828000	833000	because I thought I was literally shitting my brains out,
833000	836000	and then I couldn't get back to sleep for hours.
836000	838000	Wait, you had not shit yourself.
838000	839000	No.
839000	842000	I didn't even have to shit.
842000	844000	It was part of the confusion and the fear.
844000	847000	As soon as you were able to move, you started for the bathroom,
847000	848000	and you were like, wait, what?
848000	849000	It's all good.
849000	851000	I had to lay down, and what I was convinced was my shit.
851000	852000	Yeah.
852000	856000	I really had to convince myself it wasn't shit.
856000	860000	And it was not ideal from that point onward.
860000	863000	Didn't get a lot of sleep.
863000	868000	I had another dream where I was like walking through dog shit, too.
868000	869000	I don't know.
869000	871000	My butt's fine.
874000	878000	What do you think all that shit-related dreams signify?
878000	879000	It's really weird.
879000	880000	I've never had that before.
880000	884000	It was a really weird situation in my life.
884000	887000	Does anybody here know, like, dream analysis?
887000	890000	Well, there you go.
890000	893000	I ate a whole pizza.
893000	895000	My body might have just been working that out.
895000	896000	Large, medium, small?
896000	897000	What size pizza was it?
897000	898000	It was a large Hawaiian pizza.
898000	900000	You ate a whole large Hawaiian?
900000	901000	Yeah.
901000	902000	Okay, that's heroic.
902000	903000	Yeah.
903000	905000	You deserved to dream about shitting yourself to death.
905000	906000	That's the thing.
906000	909000	My body was just terrified.
909000	916000	I ate a lot of—I ate something that really had me going in the fart department,
916000	923000	which I refuse to call the department because I don't want to get too used to this stuff,
923000	925000	you know?
925000	931000	But I was like really—I went to Cliff's Edge over—it doesn't matter where I went.
931000	932000	It's a nice restaurant.
932000	933000	They've got a back patio.
933000	934000	Sure.
934000	937000	I haven't really seen Cody all week.
937000	940000	Or, like, for a long time, they got a holiday weekend together.
940000	945000	So I went out in a back patio at one of L.A.'s fine summer breeze restaurants
945000	949000	and had some silly food, like, for artsy farts.
949000	954000	And something in one of them, like, must have—I don't know if I'm lactose intolerant
954000	958000	and there was, like, a milk fish or something.
958000	961000	But I was, like, farting so much.
961000	964000	And I'm, like, with Cody, I'm, like, new.
964000	968000	I went through a whole—like, with McGathey, we kind of decided at the outset,
968000	971000	we're like, let's not fart in front of each other.
971000	975000	And I've kind of been doing that for a couple girlfriends, like, you know.
975000	977000	A zero fart policy.
977000	981000	I got the idea from Sarah Silverman, who—like, her relationship with Jimmy Kimmel,
981000	986000	which she was in when I was working with her, she said at one point, like,
986000	988000	I don't fart.
988000	992000	Like, in front of Jimmy and vice versa, we don't do that.
992000	994000	And I was like, really?
994000	996000	Don't you think that's kind of dishonest and unnatural?
996000	1002000	She's like, is it dishonest to, like, not fart all over the person you say you love?
1002000	1006000	Like, it's like, what are you telling them with that expression?
1006000	1010000	You know, they're like your hillbilly brother or, like, you know,
1010000	1012000	and then you're shocked if the sex goes away or whatever.
1012000	1014000	And I was like, oh, okay, that's a totally different perspective
1014000	1017000	and I've never even entertained it and ever—
1017000	1021000	and then I looked back at previous relationships and I was like, God, yeah, man,
1021000	1026000	you really get programmed by your kind of family's, like, class system,
1026000	1029000	like, or, you know, like, they're aesthetic, you know.
1029000	1032000	And there's a lot of stuff you don't even, like, second guess.
1032000	1034000	And I'm like, man, I really, like, I would always, like,
1034000	1038000	celebrate becoming intimate with a woman by, like, really starting to fart a lot.
1038000	1042000	And, like, I kind of—so I kind of, like, started tapering it off
1042000	1045000	and thinking, like, yeah, why don't you just go in the other room
1045000	1046000	if you're going to fart so bad?
1046000	1049000	Like, what's so funny about poopy farts?
1049000	1050000	Like, stop it.
1050000	1052000	So you and Cody are—
1052000	1056000	But Cody kind of was swinging back the other way, like, because she was like,
1056000	1060000	you know, just—so it's like a pendulum, you know, like, with McGathey.
1060000	1062000	And I don't think—it wasn't like McGathey's demand.
1062000	1063000	She just liked the idea, too.
1063000	1068000	And, like, we—I think, you know, we just really never farted in front of each other.
1069000	1072000	And, you know, Cody, I'm, you know, I'm letting him rip.
1072000	1073000	Like, a little bit.
1073000	1074000	A little bit.
1074000	1078000	Like, like—like I—like I'm pushing the envelope.
1080000	1081000	She kept—
1081000	1083000	You're trying to blow her mind, like—
1083000	1087000	Well, it's like—well, it's like I'll do it.
1088000	1090000	Name a key.
1090000	1091000	F-sharp.
1092000	1095000	I feel like splitting the difference is like you do one and then you, like,
1095000	1097000	kind of—you go, like, uh-oh.
1099000	1101000	And it's like, what was that?
1101000	1104000	And I think a mouse was moving a dresser.
1106000	1108000	You know, it's back to the 50s, kind of.
1108000	1111000	Now, I think a duck—I think it's duck season.
1111000	1115000	Have you done this long enough for this experiment to have proved itself out of—
1115000	1118000	whether that affects sex life or—
1118000	1122000	So far, still—I'm still creepy.
1123000	1127000	Yeah, no, that's—it hasn't really—I don't think it's changed anything.
1127000	1128000	Right.
1128000	1131000	But I'm going by laughter.
1131000	1134000	Like, if it's not going to make her laugh, then I'm not going to—
1134000	1136000	I think that's the thing.
1136000	1139000	Like, it's not about whether or not they don't throw anything at you.
1139000	1145000	It should be if they stop laughing, then maybe wait until it's funny again.
1146000	1150000	So I, like, a couple nights ago, I was like, I'll—
1150000	1153000	I'm always more awake than her, and so then I'll, like—
1153000	1155000	I do one, and she'll go, like,
1155000	1157000	that sounded so sharp!
1157000	1159000	I'll, like, talk about it for a little bit.
1159000	1161000	Yeah, it was really sharp.
1161000	1165000	And then, like, 10 minutes later, I do another one, and it's like—
1165000	1167000	I was like, did you hear that?
1167000	1168000	Yeah.
1169000	1170000	All right.
1170000	1172000	So then you pull back.
1172000	1175000	Then the next one, you go in the basement.
1176000	1181000	But is there a blue sky fart where you fart and it completely makes everything amazing?
1181000	1184000	Well, I did one today that I—
1184000	1185000	I mean, you've had—
1185000	1188000	Like, today I did one, and she was just sound asleep.
1188000	1190000	Like, I was, like, I was doing it.
1190000	1191000	It was like—
1191000	1196000	I was sitting up in bed playing some iPad game, and it was, like, building, and, like—
1196000	1199000	And then I kind of laid down for a bit and was, like, snuggling.
1199000	1201000	And then I was just, like, I'm just gonna—
1201000	1203000	I'm just gonna see what's going on here.
1204000	1209000	And I swear this is my actual estimate of the length, like, and the—
1209000	1214000	Maybe it won't sound identical, but this is my actual, not-exaggerating estimate—
1214000	1215000	Conservative estimates of—
1215000	1217000	Of the length, of the duration.
1225000	1226000	Whoa!
1227000	1228000	What?
1230000	1231000	No, no!
1238000	1240000	And then I just kind of, like, hung there, like, silent.
1240000	1243000	Din, Din, will you marry me?
1244000	1245000	That's amazing.
1245000	1248000	I went out, and I touched her on the shoulder because I wanted to—
1248000	1250000	And she was like, what, what?
1250000	1252000	And I was like, I love you.
1252000	1253000	I love you, too.
1253000	1254000	Like—
1257000	1258000	So she didn't hear it.
1259000	1261000	Stockholm syndrome.
1264000	1266000	That's an amazing fart.
1266000	1273000	There was a guy on Forensic Files who pronounced the word personality, personatally.
1276000	1279000	People out there are so crazy with their crazy hair.
1279000	1280000	There should be a—
1280000	1281000	There should be a—
1281000	1285000	And it's also fun to watch classic Forensic Files because, like, today we saw one where
1285000	1286000	they fucking—
1286000	1290000	They took 25 minutes because they were so scared we wouldn't know what GPS was.
1291000	1296000	They were like, but police didn't have to follow Andrew Kressinger.
1297000	1299000	They didn't have to.
1299000	1300000	Commercial break.
1300000	1301000	And we're like, what?
1301000	1308000	And then it comes back, and the whole act was like, high above the earth, 30 miles in outer space.
1309000	1311000	And it was like, they went—
1311000	1312000	There were eight satellites.
1312000	1314000	I mean, I learned how GPS works.
1314000	1317000	I didn't need to, but they didn't know we knew what it was.
1317000	1324000	They called it the Global Positioning System, or GPS, and they took the first letters of each word
1324000	1327000	and animated them going up into the word GPS.
1328000	1330000	This was a first-time thing for them.
1330000	1333000	They were explaining how they were using it to catch a killer.
1333000	1336000	That sounds like slow news day for them, again.
1336000	1340000	By the way, if you ever kill a little girl and the cops say to you—
1340000	1341000	And we're not saying you should.
1341000	1342000	We're not saying—
1342000	1345000	No, we're not saying you should, but here's a pitfall.
1345000	1348000	Here's a way the police are going to abuse their power.
1348000	1349000	There's three nevers.
1349000	1351000	There's three nevers on killing a little girl.
1351000	1353000	If they come to you and they say—
1353000	1356000	They go like, look, congratulations.
1357000	1362000	We know you killed that little girl, and you got away with it for now.
1362000	1365000	But you know that grave's too shallow.
1365000	1370000	You know animals are going to dig it up, and then it's just a matter of time.
1370000	1373000	Don't go drive to the shallow grave.
1374000	1378000	Dig it up, take the body, put it in your trunk,
1378000	1383000	rub the fibers around, drive it to another place,
1383000	1386000	dig a big, deep grave, put it in, cover it up,
1386000	1389000	put a flower on it, and then come back home.
1389000	1391000	Measure twice, cut once.
1394000	1396000	There's a good chance the cops aren't busting out
1396000	1403000	that shallow grave's going to give your kid's body to the dingoes soon.
1403000	1405000	They're not leaning on that until they're desperate.
1405000	1409000	So, you know, take three years and go change that body.
1409000	1415000	I think part of the fun of killing children is like riding that wave of,
1415000	1420000	how shallow should I make this grave just for the fucking action?
1420000	1421000	It's true.
1421000	1422000	Just for the fucking adrenaline.
1422000	1423000	Yeah.
1423000	1424000	Six feet, no.
1424000	1425000	How about three and a half?
1425000	1426000	And, you know, you're thinking like,
1426000	1427000	oh, Jeff, that's crazy.
1427000	1429000	Why would you kill a kid just for the thrill?
1429000	1431000	And we're not, again, we're not saying kill kids.
1431000	1435000	What we're saying is if you do, you're not doing it to become senator.
1437000	1439000	You're not doing it to make money.
1439000	1441000	You're doing it, you're doing it.
1441000	1446000	I mean, so if you're going to do it, do it, ride the edge.
1446000	1447000	Ride that edge.
1447000	1448000	Right.
1448000	1451000	Bury that kid six inches underneath some boots.
1451000	1452000	It's point break.
1453000	1454000	Fear causes hesitation.
1454000	1457000	Hesitation causes your worst fears to come true.
1457000	1461000	I'm saying bury a kid just three inches.
1462000	1464000	And, hey, while we're at it, same topic kind of related.
1464000	1467000	If you're running for president and you're a fascist, like,
1467000	1468000	look, go ahead.
1468000	1472000	Use the original artwork from the meme,
1472000	1476000	like with the anti-Semitic Star of David on the thing.
1476000	1478000	Did you see the thing?
1478000	1481000	I missed the whole thing, but there was a thing.
1482000	1485000	Trump did another meme, like the last one,
1485000	1489000	he just finds him and then he's like indisputably like,
1489000	1491000	he has no help with his Twitter account.
1491000	1493000	He has no staff.
1493000	1495000	I have to say, I think he does.
1495000	1498000	I think this is all, it can't be that unprecedented.
1498000	1500000	Well, there's a scary thing because, you know,
1500000	1502000	you read sometimes articles about his strategy,
1502000	1503000	about how he tests stuff.
1503000	1505000	He uses the internet to test stuff.
1505000	1509000	So if that were true, what if there were multiple tiers to his testing?
1509000	1512000	So, like, what if he did have people like posting crazy,
1512000	1516000	like anti-Semitic, like racist shit into like super right of right wing,
1516000	1520000	like message boards, seeing how it played with the Hustler magazine crowd
1520000	1524000	that like, like, pumping a little air into it and bumping it up,
1524000	1526000	subreddit by subreddit up.
1526000	1529000	And then all of a sudden he throws it out there and everyone's like,
1529000	1532000	these statistics are all wrong about black people in crime.
1532000	1535000	And he's like, oh, sorry about that.
1535000	1538000	Like, I know this won't blow up in my face
1538000	1541000	because it's been like built up on like layers of sediment.
1541000	1542000	I don't know.
1542000	1546000	But whatever the case is, he tweeted a meme.
1546000	1549000	He tweeted a meme.
1549000	1555000	It was like, historic Hillary and like whatever.
1555000	1556000	She's made history.
1556000	1560000	And then there was a, and there was her head cut out,
1560000	1562000	not cut off, cut out.
1562000	1564000	And it was like over just a big pile of money.
1564000	1565000	It was just money in the background.
1565000	1568000	And then there was a big red Star of David.
1568000	1571000	No matter how you slice it, just a big red Star of David.
1571000	1577000	And inside the Star of David, it said, you know, most corrupt ever.
1577000	1578000	Yeah, something like that.
1578000	1579000	Most corrupt candidate ever.
1579000	1580000	Something like that.
1580000	1584000	It was like the 20% more beef kind of like starburst thing.
1584000	1586000	The star was a Star of David.
1586000	1591000	And then people were like, what the fuck?
1591000	1593000	Holy shit.
1593000	1597000	And then like, and then they deleted that and like switched it.
1597000	1599000	And it was a red circle.
1599000	1603000	But then everyone was like, you can still see two of the six points from the star
1603000	1607000	underneath the peeking out from under the red circle.
1607000	1608000	I don't know.
1608000	1615000	I mean, just as I overheard a lady say in a candle store once,
1615000	1619000	uh, amaze-a-balls.
1619000	1620000	Amaze-a-balls.
1620000	1623000	Amaze-a-balls.
1623000	1627000	I guess she's only seen it in print, the word.
1627000	1629000	Amaze-a-balls.
1629000	1632000	She thought it was Italian.
1632000	1639000	She had what you'd call personatoly.
1639000	1640000	So yeah.
1640000	1641000	Well, with those two things lead.
1641000	1644000	So if you're going to kill a little girl, bury her shallow.
1644000	1646000	If you're going to run for president and be a Nazi,
1646000	1650000	to have Hitler's speeches next to your bed and fucking start,
1650000	1652000	start tweeting those anti-Semitic tweets.
1652000	1655000	There's no other reason to become president as a fascist
1655000	1659000	than to see if we can get this started again.
1659000	1660000	Britain's ready.
1660000	1668000	Let's get the way back machine going 1932.
1668000	1671000	That's when we start making money, by the way.
1671000	1672000	Who does?
1672000	1674000	America, during fucking big-ass wars.
1674000	1676000	Because we've gotten so good at manufacturing.
1676000	1682000	No, but that presumes that we're like the non-interventionist country
1682000	1685000	that scores after the war has already run its course.
1685000	1686000	No, no.
1686000	1688000	Isolationist America during World War II.
1688000	1690000	Fucking cha-ching.
1690000	1692000	Yeah, but we're not isolationists anymore at all.
1692000	1693000	We're going to be.
1693000	1700000	We're building a wall.
1701000	1704000	We're currently at war with the rest of the universe right now.
1704000	1707000	That's another way of saying isolationism.
1707000	1710000	Fighting a war on all fronts.
1710000	1711000	No.
1711000	1714000	Rethink that sentence.
1714000	1716000	Why am I on trial?
1716000	1717000	There's a Nazi running for president.
1717000	1719000	Focus on him.
1719000	1720000	He's not a Nazi.
1720000	1721000	He's not Hitler.
1721000	1722000	He's Mussolini.
1722000	1725000	He's a blowhard asshole.
1725000	1728000	It's a regular segment on this show.
1728000	1734000	It's just Jeff's surprisingly pro-Hitler thoughts.
1734000	1736000	I'm a pro-Hitler.
1736000	1740000	I'm saying, look, he had some good ideas.
1740000	1741000	Hear him out.
1741000	1743000	Listen to him.
1743000	1747000	As Proops points out on one of his podcasts,
1747000	1751000	Smartest Man in the World, it's like Hitler had a plan.
1751000	1754000	He wasn't just fucking winging it.
1754000	1758000	Mussolini was more of a winging it and appealing to the lowest common denominator.
1758000	1763000	Let's not praise Hitler just because Trump hasn't been elected yet.
1763000	1764000	I'm not praising Hitler.
1764000	1767000	I'm sure Trump can fucking come up with a plan.
1767000	1771000	Hopefully in a post-Hitler world, we're getting a little bit in the way.
1771000	1773000	There's more people and there's more internet.
1773000	1775000	We're going, are you about to be a Hitler?
1775000	1779000	And he's like, no, I'm huge.
1779000	1783000	Saying that Trump is a low-level Hitler is not praising Hitler.
1783000	1788000	I'm saying, well, who cares who's praising Hitler or praising Trump or whatever.
1788000	1791000	The important thing is that fascist dictators,
1791000	1795000	it's like when you put your bread out on a counter,
1795000	1800000	is the mold that grows on it a genius because it found the bread?
1800000	1806000	It's like opportunity breeds fascism.
1806000	1809000	When countries are laid low, when the economy's fucked,
1809000	1814000	when cultures start to shift so fast that there's a huge section of the population
1814000	1818000	that's kind of getting disoriented and starting to worry.
1818000	1826000	They revert to this instinct for authoritarianism.
1826000	1830000	Even in history class, it was like economic depression, recession,
1830000	1831000	all these things.
1831000	1833000	It's the potting soil for dictators,
1833000	1836000	in particular, fascists who want to nationalize everything.
1836000	1839000	They pick a scapegoat and they go, what about these guys?
1839000	1842000	How come they're making so much money or they're coming in
1842000	1844000	and they're eating all our food stamps or whatever?
1844000	1847000	You pick somebody and you go, what if we all just...
1847000	1850000	The thing about people eating food stamps is just because we're called food stamps
1850000	1852000	doesn't mean they're actual food.
1852000	1856000	It's just another reason to build a wall even higher.
1856000	1861000	The important thing to know is when we have these conversations,
1861000	1865000	we're like, you got to hand it to him or it's working.
1865000	1867000	It's working because of us.
1867000	1870000	We need to really make sure that we don't blow this story off
1870000	1875000	after he loses the election and there's crazy race gangs running out in the streets
1875000	1877000	going, I don't know, I got all amped up about this.
1877000	1879000	I guess I don't care about politics no more.
1879000	1882000	Bing bong.
1882000	1886000	I'm still unemployed.
1886000	1890000	We need to understand it's us.
1890000	1894000	The orange guy with the hair, as Spencer points out,
1894000	1897000	has been running for president for 38 years.
1897000	1899000	In one form or another, he's always been saying,
1899000	1902000	someone pay attention to me and then that birther thing started happening.
1902000	1904000	It's an opportunistic infection.
1904000	1907000	You have a gaping wound on your arm as a country,
1907000	1909000	as we all are worldwide.
1909000	1912000	The economy is like we're in vulnerable places
1912000	1915000	and so it's happening, this sentiment.
1915000	1919000	It's like, I don't want these people with the towels
1919000	1921000	and these things with the browns.
1921000	1924000	They're taking the jarbs and the taxes and the things
1924000	1926000	and why can't we have more guns?
1926000	1928000	They want the wall around the thing.
1928000	1930000	They put the wall around the thing.
1930000	1932000	It's like it's starting.
1932000	1935000	It's like those rumbles of like it's going to turn into,
1935000	1938000	it could turn into ugliness.
1938000	1940000	Could turn into ugliness.
1940000	1942000	But what was it?
1942000	1944000	Wait, wait, wait.
1944000	1946000	Oh, oh, here's the thing.
1946000	1949000	This is the thing that terrified me when I was putting on my pants today.
1949000	1953000	My dick is huge.
1953000	1956000	I was thinking, and this is going to sound like a bit,
1956000	1959000	but as far as the ratio between how much like a bit it sounds
1959000	1962000	and how actually scary I think it is,
1962000	1966000	it's like I've never said anything with this high a ratio.
1966000	1968000	How?
1968000	1971000	I'm not even sure how to phrase the question.
1972000	1979000	What percentage of Hitler being able to come into power,
1979000	1986000	what percentage of it do you think might have been your average
1986000	1989000	kind of on the bubble,
1989000	1993000	like constantly putting his foot in his mouth,
1993000	1997000	straight, white, like Jim Belushi,
1997000	2001000	like a Harmon kind of like, like, like, like, like, like,
2001000	2003000	I'm always offended, like, because I was just thinking,
2003000	2005000	I just found myself thinking while I was putting on my pants,
2005000	2007000	like heard something else that Trump said,
2007000	2009000	or was thinking about that Star of David thing,
2009000	2012000	and I was like, the thought went through my head of like,
2012000	2018000	well, it's good to know I'm not as racist as somebody.
2018000	2023000	You know, like it's good to know I'm not the biggest fucking doofus in the world.
2023000	2027000	And I was like, I'm back, like, in the 90s,
2027000	2032000	being feminist, for instance, was as easy as expecting more from women.
2036000	2039000	It changed over the years.
2039000	2041000	Like, you were like, you go, girl.
2041000	2045000	That was like a fucking, like, you were like, yeah, you can do it.
2045000	2049000	It was like, things change, and then you get like,
2049000	2053000	so, like, I wonder how many people are like,
2053000	2055000	like, with the Trump phenomenon, I wonder if that,
2055000	2058000	it was something that could happen in, like, Germany,
2058000	2061000	like, back in those days where people were like,
2061000	2065000	oh, finally, somebody that makes me sound like I like Jews.
2069000	2072000	Like, finally my daughter will stop rolling her eyes
2072000	2075000	at everything I say at the dinner table.
2075000	2078000	You know, like, I mean, and I was like, I had this, like, shudder.
2078000	2080000	I was like, wait, is that the fucking tyranny?
2080000	2081000	Is that what it is?
2081000	2085000	Is that what, is that the, is that the wildfire that catches fire
2085000	2086000	and burns up King's Landing?
2086000	2090000	Like, is that the, is that, is that, is, it's the actual, just like,
2090000	2094000	it's the, it's the, it's the oxygen, it's the styrofoam peanuts,
2094000	2097000	it's the shit that coats the film in Inglourious Basterds,
2097000	2102000	it's the, the, the actual accelerant isn't like the fucking, like, hard,
2102000	2106000	it takes work to be a fucking redneck stump humping,
2106000	2109000	fucking, like, active, like, racist, or you're like,
2109000	2113000	I'm going to hit you with a stick, you see, your color, like, geez,
2113000	2118000	that guy is committed, um, the, the, the, like, like, like,
2118000	2121000	what about the fucking mob around that person that's like,
2121000	2124000	that's like, I know that's bad and I want to be liked,
2124000	2126000	I know that's bad and I don't want to be a bad person,
2126000	2129000	I don't know, like, like, like, what is the phenomenon that might happen,
2129000	2131000	you know, like, like, we have to be on guard against that,
2131000	2134000	because, like, I just, like, feel that in my soul,
2134000	2136000	like, so these things eating away at the edges where I'm like,
2136000	2142000	why am I trying so hard, why, why do I try, why, like, like, like, like,
2142000	2145000	you know, and it's like, there's important answers to those questions
2145000	2147000	we all have to ask.
2147000	2150000	Uh, uh, so when you put on your pants next time,
2150000	2154000	please join me at these heights of thought.
2154000	2157000	Just asking the specific questions, I just want to recap the question,
2157000	2162000	how many people in pre-Nazi Germany do you think were a little bit,
2162000	2165000	like, where, um, that became Hitler supporters,
2165000	2168000	were anti-Hitler in their conversation,
2168000	2171000	but then in some weird, polaric valve part of them,
2171000	2174000	were like, uh, they were like,
2174000	2178000	uh, that guy's a goofball, he'll take all the pressure off me.
2178000	2180000	You know, like...
2180000	2182000	At that time, there was a lot of parties vying for power
2182000	2185000	and the Weimar Republic was falling to pieces and there was always provision...
2185000	2189000	There were so many parties vying for power that they had to call it the Weimar Republic.
2190000	2192000	Because they were, like, vying is like,
2192000	2194000	all right, keep going, I'm sorry.
2194000	2197000	Strahb hasn't been here in a, like, couple of months.
2199000	2203000	But there was a, there was a bunch of asshole meathead bully thugs
2203000	2206000	that were running around with brown shirts on and kicking everybody's ass
2206000	2209000	and blaming the economy, because the economy was fucked.
2209000	2211000	There was this giant depression going on
2211000	2214000	and they're blaming it all on foreigners,
2214000	2217000	which is what you see going on all over Europe, also here.
2217000	2221000	And, uh, then at some point, I think, like,
2221000	2225000	when this certain really radical party starts saying, like,
2225000	2227000	we'll kick your ass if you don't agree with us
2227000	2230000	that Jews are the problem and all this shit and, like,
2230000	2232000	really extreme stuff, I think a lot of people are like,
2232000	2235000	look, I would just like the economy to get back on track
2235000	2238000	and we'll start following anybody that really has answers
2238000	2242000	to getting the economy going, which is all baloney.
2242000	2243000	It's all complete bullshit.
2243000	2247000	It's not as simple as immigration, like, or leaving the EU.
2247000	2250000	It's like, it's crazy talk.
2250000	2254000	But I think people want simple answers when the economy is fucked
2254000	2256000	and they're working-class people,
2256000	2259000	and they will listen to lunatic billionaires who say, like,
2259000	2261000	I'm on your side. They're not fucking on your side.
2261000	2264000	They have nothing to do with you. They don't even know who you are.
2264000	2267000	Also, everything they're saying, it makes no sense at all.
2268000	2275000	The answer is, will average people start becoming okay with radical ideas?
2275000	2278000	Yes. Absolutely. They do.
2278000	2281000	And what's happening all over the world right now,
2281000	2285000	in major democracies, including ours, and all over, like,
2285000	2289000	France and England, like, fascism, right-wing extremism,
2289000	2291000	racism is on the rise.
2291000	2293000	Yeah, it's gaining football. Absolutely.
2293000	2295000	And it's the places that are collapsing first.
2295000	2297000	The banks are closing, well, then there's a swastika,
2297000	2300000	like, five feet from there, you know, like, in Greece and stuff.
2300000	2303000	Like, the national socialism is... Yeah.
2303000	2306000	The average person in Germany didn't hate Jews,
2306000	2310000	but the average person was okay with, like, kind of going along with the flow.
2310000	2313000	And also, like, there was also...
2313000	2316000	Germany is a huge country full of different neighbors
2316000	2319000	that believed in different things, followed different parties.
2319000	2321000	Also, at some point, fear comes into it.
2321000	2324000	The idea that speaking up for what you believe,
2324000	2326000	actually becomes illegal.
2326000	2329000	And that's the scary thing, is that right now, we're still...
2329000	2332000	Like, we can still talk shit about Trump
2332000	2335000	and talk shit about what, like, the direction things are going,
2335000	2337000	and it can still be comedy.
2337000	2340000	That might go away before too long.
2340000	2342000	Like, that's the real danger, is that it's actually illegal...
2342000	2344000	Certainly, if you're out in the fringe and you're, for instance,
2344000	2348000	paint... I don't know, that lady who was painting Trump
2348000	2350000	with a little dick or whatever, and some guy runs up...
2350000	2352000	Public enemy number one. Yeah.
2353000	2355000	I mean, it's like...
2355000	2359000	So, what's the takeaway?
2359000	2361000	I think it's that in the coming years,
2361000	2364000	I don't think that Trump is going to get elected, but...
2364000	2367000	I don't think that you should be that comfortable saying that.
2367000	2369000	I think it's very, very likely.
2369000	2371000	Jesus Christ. Well, okay, I put a pin in that, but...
2371000	2373000	People hate Hillary so much,
2373000	2375000	for whatever their reasons are right or wrong,
2375000	2378000	people despise her and will vote against somebody
2378000	2381000	for whatever they believe about her.
2381000	2385000	And they will also vote for this incredible quack.
2385000	2387000	They will vote for him.
2387000	2389000	Well, I think the easiest thing to say, though,
2389000	2393000	is disregard what you think the results of the election might be,
2393000	2399000	because in either case, like, what's clear from this process,
2399000	2404000	like, this fat orange manic bullet that shot
2404000	2407000	or, like, squirted out of a volcano,
2407000	2411000	like, it represents magma underneath,
2411000	2413000	and it's not...
2413000	2417000	Well, this is where my lack of a geology degree
2417000	2420000	will probably break this metaphor down, but...
2420000	2422000	But it doesn't mean,
2422000	2427000	oh, look at that really scary volcano that we have to deal with.
2427000	2429000	Oh, it seems to have gone dormant.
2429000	2432000	Like, that's why I really want people to understand.
2432000	2436000	Like, it starts with hero worship.
2436000	2437000	It's in politics.
2437000	2440000	It starts with this idea that we're waiting for somebody
2440000	2442000	to, you know, lead us or say the right things,
2442000	2445000	or the president's office is, like, so important and valuable,
2445000	2447000	and it changes so much,
2447000	2449000	and that's why we need the right person in that office.
2449000	2451000	So if we could just...
2451000	2454000	And that really noble thought, like, ends somewhere with, like,
2454000	2457000	somehow you're making a pact with the devil where you're like,
2457000	2459000	well, I'm not worth anything,
2459000	2461000	and I can't do anything and all this stuff.
2461000	2463000	And then we're in this really dangerous time
2463000	2465000	where we finally, for the first time, we've gotten this voice,
2465000	2468000	this first generation to be raised in front of a keyboard
2468000	2470000	with a blinking cursor in front of it.
2470000	2473000	They've mastered the hashtag and the linguistic acrobatics
2473000	2476000	that represent, like, not getting all fucking bent out of shape
2476000	2478000	when a girl says she just wants to be friends.
2478000	2482000	Like, they're advancing the species, like, by leaps and bounds
2482000	2486000	because they're able to interface with machines
2486000	2489000	and psychologically keep a lid on shit.
2489000	2492000	However, like, the scary thing about that
2492000	2494000	is that now we're all just, like...
2494000	2497000	We're, like, talking, and we're talking and we're talking about
2497000	2499000	what's right and what's wrong,
2499000	2502000	and I hope we don't tail spin into, like,
2502000	2504000	oh, man, did you see that racist TV show last night?
2504000	2506000	Yeah, that was so racist. Did you hashtag it?
2506000	2507000	Yeah, I did.
2507000	2509000	While this shit continues to happen,
2509000	2511000	like, push may come to shove at a certain point,
2511000	2513000	and it may not be the people that are saying
2513000	2516000	the most eloquent, most progressive-sounding things
2516000	2519000	that are the people who, at the bottom line of it all,
2519000	2522000	are just people who want the power to leave the hands of the few
2522000	2524000	and go into the hands of the many.
2524000	2528000	Like, you may have to fight fucking fascism with anarchy.
2528000	2530000	I don't know what else you fight it with.
2530000	2532000	I put water on a fire myself.
2532000	2533000	Like, I...
2533000	2536000	And the fact that anarchy, to us, means explosions and chaos
2536000	2540000	is part of a 70-year indoctrination that started with, like,
2540000	2542000	let's make that word mean terrorism.
2542000	2544000	It doesn't. It means no hierarchy.
2544000	2546000	It means nobody has the right to tell you what to do.
2547000	2550000	So, like, you know, we may have to...
2550000	2552000	It's always scary, the spattering of applause,
2552000	2556000	because it means that, like, what I hear is the silence between each.
2558000	2562000	And it's like, oh, Harmon said something really specific last night.
2562000	2565000	Get that weird Chinese checkers applause.
2566000	2568000	It's like, guys with bowler hats going,
2568000	2571000	heard you loud and clear, blokey, mighty,
2571000	2573000	milky, milky, welly, well.
2574000	2577000	But, like, our low-level anarchism,
2577000	2579000	the idea that we hate being told what to do,
2579000	2582000	that the absence of rule doesn't mean chaos.
2582000	2583000	It shouldn't mean that.
2583000	2585000	No, it doesn't. Anarchy doesn't mean...
2585000	2587000	No, it does not mean, like, stirring shit up.
2587000	2589000	It doesn't have to.
2589000	2593000	Anarchy means you don't think you have a right to tell other people what to do.
2593000	2595000	You don't really respect their right to tell you what to do.
2595000	2597000	You don't really see that as a...
2597000	2599000	You may see that as a way to put out a fire
2599000	2601000	or get health insurance or get shit done,
2602000	2605000	keep people from getting hurt in a crowd situation.
2605000	2607000	But it's not an inherent need.
2607000	2610000	You don't believe that people are these animals
2610000	2611000	that, left to their own devices,
2611000	2614000	are going to start running around and doing fucked-up shit
2614000	2617000	unless there's an elite class that pays themselves to do nothing
2617000	2620000	but think about how we should be mitigated.
2620000	2623000	You just think that shit works the way it works.
2623000	2625000	And the idea that right now,
2625000	2628000	whether you like Hillary or you hate Trump
2628000	2629000	or like Trump or hate Hillary,
2629000	2631000	whatever the fuck you think, or if you're a Bernie supporter
2631000	2633000	and you're all disappointed about that,
2633000	2635000	the idea that one human being is going to come along
2635000	2638000	and make everything okay is crazy.
2638000	2641000	It's really adolescent and really dumb.
2641000	2645000	The idea that we need leadership from one person holding one office
2645000	2647000	that used to be a shit-fucking gig,
2647000	2652000	a low-paid, crap, clerical gig in our constitutional government.
2652000	2654000	It's really crazy, but right now,
2654000	2657000	wouldn't we be really happy if anybody came along
2657000	2659000	who could put a thoughtful sentence together
2659000	2661000	and not irritate us?
2661000	2664000	That's the danger of what's going on right now
2664000	2667000	with this, it's going to be Hillary and Trump,
2667000	2668000	and we're going to just go,
2668000	2669000	I just wish somebody could talk
2669000	2672000	and I would like to hear them finish the goddamn thought.
2672000	2674000	And that's horrifying.
2674000	2677000	We shouldn't care about one person's fucking ideas.
2677000	2683000	There should be a gigantic consortium of people getting together.
2683000	2685000	Community should fucking operate together.
2685000	2686000	Family should operate together.
2686000	2688000	Well, we have the tools to do it right now.
2688000	2692000	This is a generation that's actively figuring out how to do that stuff.
2692000	2694000	And I think that the next step,
2694000	2698000	maybe it's not even thinking of waiting for some profit to arise
2698000	2699000	and switching things.
2699000	2700000	It's like it actually is just like,
2700000	2702000	oh shit, we got these apps.
2702000	2703000	We got this internet.
2703000	2704000	We got it going.
2704000	2706000	We can think and act locally
2706000	2708000	and we can give unto Caesar what is Caesar's.
2708000	2712000	Instead of just letting the...
2712000	2713000	We just came off this thing.
2713000	2716000	I think all we're doing right now is voting for the next best Caesar.
2716000	2717000	Everybody is like...
2717000	2718000	I know, but we don't...
2718000	2719000	We could...
2719000	2722000	There are some people in this audience that watch The Voice and American Idol,
2722000	2724000	but they also watched Community.
2724000	2727000	You know, like they can...
2727000	2731000	Dan, that's not true.
2731000	2732000	It means that you can say,
2732000	2735000	when I'm interested in who's going to be the best singer
2735000	2737000	in this season of the best singer show,
2737000	2741000	I don't necessarily have to let that thought process trickle down
2741000	2744000	into how I pass the salt to my friend over dinner.
2744000	2745000	When they go,
2745000	2746000	could you pass me the salt?
2746000	2747000	I go, I don't know.
2747000	2750000	How good are you at asking for passing the salt?
2750000	2752000	Those glasses don't look good on you.
2752000	2754000	I think that smart look is stupid.
2754000	2756000	Why don't you take them off and ask for the salt?
2756000	2758000	All right, now give me a high C.
2758000	2759000	I'd like the salt there.
2759000	2761000	Now that's what I'm talking about.
2761000	2764000	Now you've earned my salt because I watch American Idol.
2764000	2766000	No, you can watch American Idol and you can go,
2766000	2767000	that's for that.
2767000	2769000	You can elect a president and go,
2769000	2771000	that's a person that if a Supreme Court justice dies,
2771000	2774000	they have the power to like, no.
2774000	2776000	There are certain things that are important
2776000	2778000	that we're voting for these people for,
2778000	2780000	but it doesn't have anything to do with whether your street
2780000	2783000	has potholes on it and all that shit.
2783000	2785000	Me, I'm old and I'm busy, so good luck.
2785000	2789000	But I do think, I mean, yeah,
2789000	2792000	what if we did enter an age when we were just voting
2792000	2793000	for the least offensive person?
2793000	2795000	What if that was their job?
2795000	2797000	You know, and they didn't, you know, and then like,
2797000	2799000	what if you built like from the ground up,
2799000	2801000	like you built like this sort of like,
2801000	2803000	there was a word for it and there was a phrase for it
2803000	2805000	and it was anarchy because it didn't have leadership
2805000	2807000	because it didn't need it because it did take advantage
2807000	2810000	of technology faster than these people at the top could
2810000	2812000	and so that they found themselves
2812000	2815000	in the most powerful position of the world,
2815000	2818000	but it was in charge of a fucking slab of marble
2818000	2820000	that couldn't be cracked, couldn't be lifted
2820000	2821000	and couldn't be moved that they're like,
2821000	2824000	I'm on top of it, kind of lonely up here and windy.
2824000	2827000	I get to jump off in four years or stay on for another four
2827000	2830000	and the people that don't fuck up get to stay up there
2830000	2833000	and we're down here going like, we figured it out.
2833000	2837000	We are, it has to do with on a molecular level going like,
2837000	2839000	I think our biggest challenge right now is we've been
2839000	2842000	so stoked about how much cleaning needs to be done
2842000	2844000	around the apartment that you ever get on one of those
2844000	2846000	tantrums where you're like, you're like,
2846000	2849000	fuck all this shit, fuck it, shit.
2849000	2851000	It's like you're just throwing away like Bibles
2851000	2855000	and like new pens and money.
2855000	2857000	You're going to take a fist full of pennies
2857000	2858000	and you're like, fucking pennies.
2858000	2860000	You're going to fucking pennies.
2860000	2862000	Like when you're cleaning your office or whatever
2862000	2866000	and you're like, fucking, it just brings this rage out in you
2866000	2868000	that is like against clutter and you're like,
2868000	2870000	I want to simplify my life.
2870000	2872000	I think that's, we've hit the peak of that
2872000	2874000	with the whole woke kind of thing,
2874000	2875000	like where we're calling out racism,
2875000	2877000	we're calling out negative thought,
2877000	2879000	we're exposing like, we're like,
2879000	2880000	what the fuck has this person ever done for me?
2880000	2882000	Ah, another person that turns out to hate women.
2882000	2883000	No big surprise.
2883000	2886000	And it's like, and everything has to go in the garbage right now
2886000	2888000	because we're like cleaning out our space.
2888000	2891000	But like we are going to have to get to a point
2891000	2893000	if that space is going to be of any use,
2893000	2895000	we're going to have to be like,
2895000	2896000	well, not everything that goes in this room
2896000	2899000	needs to be the Mona Lisa because this isn't a museum,
2899000	2902000	this is an office or a living room or a parlor.
2902000	2907000	You know, like my friend has some regressive thoughts about women.
2908000	2911000	He hasn't scratched that off on his bingo card yet.
2911000	2915000	He's really, really like super amazing about race.
2916000	2918000	Like he really hates women.
2918000	2919000	Like I'm not going to like,
2919000	2923000	like just like record him over lunch
2923000	2927000	and then post it on Facebook and expose him as a thing.
2927000	2928000	Like I'm going to,
2928000	2931000	I'm going to like actually like work with him
2931000	2937000	and like, you know, like kind of polish him like a stone,
2937000	2940000	like with my water, you know.
2940000	2941000	I'm going to, I'm going to,
2941000	2944000	and strangers that I find out are regressive,
2944000	2947000	I'm ignorant because they haven't talked to
2947000	2949000	as many people that look like me yet.
2949000	2953000	I'm going to, I'm going to do something really difficult,
2953000	2956000	which is like, I'm just going to be this billboard
2956000	2959000	for people that this person has never talked to
2959000	2962000	and I'm going to make every experience a positive one or like,
2962000	2964000	or I'm just, I don't know what the fucking definition is,
2964000	2966000	but it's like harder than,
2966000	2970000	it's way, way harder than finger pointing and shaming and like,
2970000	2973000	and chanting and like pushing down another pillar
2973000	2976000	and watching another thing that was resting on it collapse.
2976000	2979000	Like I think that we've got a good six months left of that before it gets,
2979000	2982000	like aren't we just, when the guy running,
2982000	2986000	like one of the two people running is just like this turd person.
2986000	2987000	Like he's just,
2988000	2990000	he's not going to do anything with that rubble.
2990000	2991000	Like he's not going to let go.
2991000	2992000	Thank you very much.
2992000	2993000	And now I'm going to take that.
2993000	2995000	We're going to build a big monument to women with it.
2995000	2997000	Like he's not going, he's, he's going to go like,
2997000	3000000	let's make missiles with this rubble.
3001000	3004000	It's going to be up to us,
3004000	3007000	like how we interior decorate the nation.
3012000	3013000	Yeah, we should do it.
3013000	3015000	We will do it on the moon.
3016000	3019000	Like after his cars kill,
3019000	3023000	maybe we can go like merge with him and he'll like, if you give us a,
3023000	3026000	right before you said to still on the moon,
3026000	3029000	the original like joke premise of this podcast was like,
3029000	3030000	like we'd like,
3030000	3034000	let's find like-minded people and colonize another place and make things okay.
3034000	3038000	Like we're going to have to like start like making colonies of like-minded
3038000	3042000	people here and actually let that become revolutionary.
3042000	3043000	You know where we're going to start doing it,
3043000	3045000	Jeff, where we pick the people that,
3045000	3049000	that get to help us at the Comic Con Harmon town show.
3052000	3057000	Wait, are you talking about the one July 22nd at the,
3059000	3064000	at the Balboa theater, the one who apparently our ticket sales are so shit
3064000	3067000	that we have to shoehorn this into our own show.
3067000	3071000	Apparently the show that's got show runners so worried that they're calling
3071000	3075000	Steve Levy and saying, you guys got to sell tickets or we're going to have to
3075000	3076000	mix this whole thing.
3076000	3077000	Not me show run.
3077000	3080000	Not show run like the ones that run the shows having.
3080000	3081000	What do they call them?
3081000	3083000	Stage peoples, right?
3083000	3084000	Stage peoples.
3084000	3085000	Stage peoples.
3085000	3086000	Stage peoples.
3086000	3087000	Oh yeah.
3087000	3088000	Big time.
3088000	3089000	You know what else happens?
3089000	3091000	How many seats is the Balboa theater, Steve Levy?
3091000	3092000	So many.
3094000	3097000	A thousand or we can do a thousand on our fucking heads.
3097000	3099000	I mean, we don't even have to,
3099000	3102000	but we aren't even doing not even a thousand.
3102000	3105000	How much, what's, what's the ticket price at the Balboa theater?
3105000	3106000	Twenty four dollars.
3106000	3107000	Twenty four dollars?
3107000	3108000	Okay, fuck it.
3108000	3109000	Don't go.
3109000	3112000	That's, that's too much.
3112000	3113000	That's a lot of money.
3113000	3114000	That's their problem.
3114000	3117000	It should be, it should be fucking, I would say 12 tops.
3117000	3121000	I would say, I would say your $10 here is a little unfair.
3121000	3127000	And I think you're getting ripped off a little bit to the tune of two to four dollars.
3128000	3130000	I would call this a eight to six dollars.
3130000	3133000	Also at Comic Con, you're going to be...
3133000	3134000	Steve's shaking his head.
3134000	3136000	Twenty four dollars.
3136000	3142000	Also, you have to be in San Diego, which is, you should have to get twenty four dollars back just for entering San Diego.
3145000	3146000	Well, that is true.
3146000	3148000	It sucks. It's a terrible, terrible city.
3148000	3149000	Well, let's figure out, we're smart people.
3149000	3150000	We can figure this out.
3150000	3151000	Have you tried Mexican food in San Diego?
3151000	3152000	You think it would be great.
3152000	3154000	It's right by it.
3154000	3156000	It's right by Mexico.
3156000	3159000	And you'd be fucked if you can get a fucking proper taco without leaving the tent.
3159000	3162000	You have to get out of San Diego to get Mexican food.
3162000	3163000	You'd be fucked.
3163000	3164000	Huh?
3164000	3166000	If you try to get a taco.
3166000	3168000	You're going to the wrong places.
3168000	3169000	You're going to the wrong places.
3169000	3170000	There's one place.
3170000	3175000	Look, I know the San Diego people here will meet after the show.
3175000	3177000	You tell me where to go get tacos.
3177000	3180000	And I will tell you that it's not in San Diego.
3180000	3182000	You're just outside of town.
3182000	3184000	You have to get out.
3185000	3186000	It's not a walk from Comic Con.
3186000	3189000	You have to get into a car to get fucking food there.
3189000	3190000	Let's find out.
3190000	3191000	Let's ask ourselves.
3191000	3193000	I'm saying don't go to Comic Con.
3193000	3196000	Don't go to the Balboa Theater on July 22nd.
3197000	3199000	I don't think you have the guts to prove me wrong.
3199000	3200000	Let's...
3202000	3203000	I guess there's that.
3203000	3205000	I've been to your shitty town.
3206000	3209000	Let's figure out if this is a $10 show.
3209000	3211000	Just every guy has a wallet chain.
3211000	3214000	We'll give out free prizes at the Comic Con.
3214000	3218000	If you're walking into an establishment and the bouncer has a wallet chain on,
3218000	3220000	you're in a terrible place.
3222000	3223000	Let's figure out if this is a...
3223000	3224000	Barbed wire tattoos?
3224000	3225000	Nope.
3225000	3226000	Nope.
3226000	3228000	If this is a $10 show...
3228000	3229000	No.
3229000	3232000	Then we just need to figure out what a $12 show is,
3232000	3236000	which is as easy as raising this one 20% in terms of quality,
3236000	3238000	and then doubling that for San Diego.
3238000	3239000	Right.
3240000	3241000	That's all I wanted to say for the last...
3241000	3242000	Five hours.
3242000	3243000	What's that?
3243000	3244000	We go for five hours.
3244000	3246000	I don't think that increases the value of our show.
3246000	3252000	I will have no respect for anybody that pays to see our show in San Diego.
3252000	3254000	I will be mad at everybody that comes there
3254000	3259000	and has put down $24 at the Balboa Theater on July 22nd.
3261000	3265000	And not just because Dan and I are going to do an all-new review
3265000	3267000	to start the show.
3267000	3269000	I'm saying it's not a reason to go see it.
3269000	3274000	And we'd also be really mad if you made a website using Squarespace.
3276000	3281000	Even though they use an intuitive design that works across all platforms.
3281000	3285000	Also, maybe you live in LA, all you people here,
3285000	3290000	maybe driving down to San Diego, don't listen to audible.com.
3291000	3295000	I don't care how reasonable the prices are to listen to your favorite novels online,
3296000	3298000	or even if you get a free book with sign-up.
3301000	3304000	And I don't care if you're wearing my undies, the softest underwear.
3305000	3307000	Well, who needs books anyway?
3307000	3312000	It's like all you people out there with your stupid Warby Parker glasses.
3316000	3318000	Which we also don't want you to get.
3318000	3324000	And when you get them, don't use them to look at fullscreen.com's content.
3324000	3327000	Even though it only costs as much as a cup of coffee.
3327000	3329000	A cup of coffee!
3329000	3331000	A giant coffee a month.
3332000	3333000	Yeah.
3334000	3336000	For a month!
3336000	3339000	But I think the reverse thing has to work, but I think you have to say to them,
3339000	3344000	like, don't come, or if you do, I'll kiss you to death.
3344000	3345000	Will it be on CSO?
3345000	3346000	Nah, nah.
3346000	3348000	The Comic-Con show? No.
3348000	3349000	No, no.
3349000	3351000	No, it won't. You won't be able to see it.
3351000	3352000	You know what we should do?
3352000	3353000	What?
3353000	3354000	It's not recorded.
3355000	3356000	Oh, shit.
3360000	3362000	Master Blaster Rotten Butter Town!
3364000	3365000	No more pig shit!
3365000	3366000	Fuel!
3367000	3369000	Are you threatening or writing a title?
3369000	3370000	That's right.
3370000	3373000	Drive to San Diego and give us $24.
3376000	3378000	I want everyone to prove me.
3378000	3381000	Someone take me to get to the best taco place in San Diego
3381000	3383000	so I could not be mad at San Diego.
3384000	3385000	Talking to El Gordo.
3385000	3387000	Talking to El Gordo.
3387000	3388000	El Gordo.
3388000	3389000	El Gordo.
3389000	3390000	El Gordo.
3390000	3391000	El Gordo.
3391000	3393000	I'll tell you after the show.
3393000	3394000	El Gordo.
3394000	3395000	El Gordo.
3395000	3396000	El Gordo.
3396000	3397000	Fat.
3397000	3398000	Fat.
3398000	3399000	Gordo.
3399000	3400000	Gordo.
3400000	3401000	Fat.
3401000	3402000	Fatty tacos.
3402000	3403000	Something like that.
3403000	3404000	Alright.
3404000	3405000	Who's like a...
3405000	3406000	Who's a huge...
3406000	3407000	Oh, me.
3407000	3414000	Who's a huge Harmon Town fan and like maybe...
3414000	3415000	I don't know.
3415000	3418000	Well, I was going to say it has like a degree in marketing.
3418000	3421000	But maybe in your own head you do.
3421000	3422000	Yeah.
3422000	3423000	Like you know.
3423000	3424000	Like you're sitting here.
3424000	3426000	A young lady raised her hand there.
3426000	3427000	Like would you like to come up and just...
3427000	3428000	Raise it.
3428000	3429000	No, you don't want to...
3429000	3430000	Yeah?
3430000	3431000	Okay.
3431000	3432000	Wait, we've got...
3432000	3433000	We'll keep...
3433000	3436000	We'll put him on deck.
3437000	3439000	She's charging the stage.
3439000	3440000	I love it.
3440000	3441000	Yeah.
3441000	3442000	What's your name?
3442000	3443000	Savannah.
3443000	3444000	Savannah.
3444000	3445000	Savannah have a seat.
3445000	3446000	Grab a mic.
3446000	3447000	I think they're...
3447000	3448000	Oh, here.
3448000	3449000	Here.
3449000	3450000	You can use this.
3450000	3451000	Get her a mic.
3451000	3452000	Oh, okay.
3452000	3453000	Alright.
3453000	3454000	Okay.
3454000	3457000	I switched mics for those of you in the control booth.
3457000	3458000	If you like Savannah you can pull out the stand.
3458000	3459000	Oh no, you can do it.
3459000	3460000	Yeah, sit and...
3460000	3461000	Yeah, here.
3461000	3462000	Let's get rid of this.
3462000	3463000	You piece of shit.
3463000	3464000	You piece of shit.
3464000	3465000	Why is it there?
3465000	3466000	Why is it there?
3466000	3467000	It's made of pennies.
3467000	3471000	Do you ever throw away pennies when you're cleaning your office or your room or something?
3471000	3474000	Yeah, I can't be bothered to, like, organize things.
3474000	3475000	I just throw it all in a bag.
3475000	3476000	Do you ever throw away books?
3476000	3477000	Yeah.
3477000	3478000	Well, a couple times.
3478000	3480000	You feel guilty, right?
3480000	3481000	Because you're like...
3481000	3482000	It's like knowledge and it's like...
3482000	3484000	Yeah, especially if I, like, paid for them for school.
3484000	3485000	I just, like...
3485000	3486000	But even if you didn't...
3486000	3487000	But there's so much anger.
3487000	3489000	What is that guilt we feel about throwing away books?
3489000	3491000	I don't throw away books.
3491000	3494000	Well, I...
3494000	3496000	Because I would feel too guilty about it.
3496000	3497000	Okay, well, what is that guilt?
3497000	3498000	What is it?
3498000	3501000	Uh, somebody put a lot of effort into a book, I think.
3501000	3502000	I couldn't...
3502000	3503000	Even if I hate the book...
3503000	3506000	We don't treat it as the physical thing that it is.
3506000	3508000	We treat it as the ideas it represents.
3508000	3509000	Uh-huh.
3509000	3511000	Like, when you work in books, you're like,
3511000	3513000	this is fucking garbage and you're ripping covers off shit.
3513000	3515000	It's like a really weird, harrowing experience.
3515000	3519000	I'd assume it's a lot like working in the meat industry, you know?
3520000	3524000	We're soon, I don't know if you're just banging calves against walls and shit.
3524000	3526000	Yeah, look it up.
3526000	3528000	It could even be a subjective guilt that's, like,
3528000	3530000	the equivalent of throwing away a barbell.
3530000	3531000	And you're like...
3531000	3532000	Yeah.
3532000	3533000	That you've never used.
3533000	3534000	Like, you're like, oh, am I really committing to that?
3534000	3536000	Yep, throwing away the barbell.
3536000	3537000	And also, the garbage man's gonna be like,
3537000	3539000	Jesus Christ.
3539000	3540000	He's all ripped.
3541000	3542000	9-11.
3542000	3543000	9-11.
3550000	3551000	Savannah?
3551000	3552000	Yes, Savannah.
3552000	3553000	Like the biome?
3553000	3555000	Yes, exactly like the biome.
3555000	3557000	But with only one end.
3557000	3559000	So, the biome, but with one end.
3559000	3560000	Savannah?
3560000	3561000	Savannah, yeah.
3561000	3566000	Where apes supposedly started walking upright to see over the tall grass
3566000	3568000	and then to free their hands for tool use.
3568000	3570000	But not true, the Savannah theory.
3570000	3571000	Okay.
3571000	3575000	Wiped off the charts in 1995 by virtue of finding a new semi-human
3575000	3578000	that had nutrients in its bones that could not have been the result
3578000	3580000	of eating food on the Savannah.
3580000	3583000	So, we're living in a world where we don't know where humans came from.
3583000	3584000	Aquaticate.
3584000	3585000	All right.
3585000	3586000	So...
3588000	3590000	But I'm sure it's a beautiful name.
3591000	3592000	So, what do you think?
3592000	3595000	You're a big Harman Town fan and you're thinking, like,
3595000	3598000	wouldn't you apply your mind to how we could get people to show up
3598000	3601000	to the Balboa Theater on Friday?
3601000	3603000	Oh, you didn't know I was gonna twist it to that?
3603000	3604000	No, I didn't.
3604000	3605000	Oh, okay.
3605000	3606000	Well, what did you think I was gonna ask?
3606000	3607000	I don't know.
3607000	3609000	I thought maybe you had a theory or something.
3609000	3610000	I didn't know.
3610000	3613000	Well, what's your favorite aspect of Harman Town?
3613000	3614000	Um...
3614000	3615000	The prizes.
3617000	3618000	The cash giveaways.
3618000	3620000	The prizes and free alcohol.
3620000	3621000	Yeah.
3621000	3622000	Uh-huh.
3622000	3623000	Would you want a drink?
3623000	3624000	Is that what you're saying?
3624000	3625000	No, I'm okay.
3625000	3626000	Thank you.
3626000	3627000	Have a drink, Savannah.
3631000	3632000	What's a thing...
3632000	3633000	Put it this way.
3634000	3639000	So, say I'm like a businessman that bought Harman Town
3639000	3641000	and I'm like, I want to make Harman Town.
3641000	3644000	I'm gonna give it to people.
3644000	3645000	I'm gonna do something...
3645000	3650000	I won't get specific, but you've been called in as a Harman Town expert.
3650000	3652000	All the other Harman Town listeners have been wiped out
3652000	3659000	in some pretzel factory explosion during dollar tours
3660000	3661000	because they're frugal.
3661000	3662000	They're practical.
3662000	3663000	They love sodium.
3663000	3665000	My demographic is...
3665000	3668000	Look, polls don't lie.
3670000	3672000	You guys love pretzels.
3672000	3673000	So, they're all wiped out.
3673000	3676000	You're sort of like the person who's in charge
3676000	3680000	of representing the demographic that listens to the show.
3680000	3684000	And so, some suit is hauling you in and going like,
3684000	3685000	what's the deal with it?
3685000	3687000	Why don't I just get rid of it?
3688000	3689000	What parts of it do I preserve?
3689000	3690000	What's the point?
3690000	3692000	What kind of things would you...
3696000	3699000	Well, I'm sorry to all the other Harman Town fans who are gone,
3699000	3702000	but I think they would probably, if they were still there,
3702000	3707000	would like maybe some of Jane's alcohol merchandise for Harman Town.
3708000	3709000	I'll bring some.
3709000	3711000	I have some at my house.
3711000	3713000	We could bring it to give away to the fans.
3713000	3714000	Give it away in the bottles.
3714000	3718000	The problem is that's highly illegal for various federal reasons.
3719000	3720000	So, figure that out.
3720000	3721000	Yes.
3721000	3723000	He's not allowed to license his own booze.
3723000	3724000	Okay.
3725000	3728000	And maybe more free t-shirts.
3728000	3729000	More free t-shirts.
3729000	3730000	T-shirts.
3730000	3732000	Oh, I think we have a shit ton of t-shirts.
3732000	3736000	An Instagram contest, maybe, if you want to get the young people.
3736000	3737000	Instagram contest.
3737000	3738000	Snapchat.
3738000	3739000	Snapchat contest.
3739000	3740000	How does that work?
3740000	3743000	Will you just give them a time limit to submit things
3743000	3745000	on whatever platform you're going to use for Snapchat
3745000	3747000	if you create a filter for your show?
3747000	3749000	It's $5 for just the evening,
3749000	3751000	for just the area that you're doing it in.
3751000	3752000	What?
3752000	3753000	Yeah, $5.
3753000	3754000	I'm going to do that tonight.
3754000	3755000	50,000 square feet.
3755000	3757000	Just a big old dick.
3759000	3762000	You're in Larchmont, bitch.
3767000	3769000	Hashtag Spencer Dick.
3769000	3772000	Hash, no, just Larchmont.
3772000	3774000	I actually don't understand.
3774000	3776000	Can you, because I want to, understand.
3776000	3777000	So, do you use Snapchat?
3777000	3778000	I have.
3778000	3779000	Yes, okay.
3779000	3781000	So, on Snapchat there are the filters you can use
3781000	3783000	that companies can create.
3783000	3784000	You can also create them for communities
3784000	3786000	if you're not making any money off of it.
3786000	3787000	And those are free if you get them approved
3787000	3789000	and they meet the community guidelines,
3789000	3791000	which I'm not sure if you're...
3791000	3792000	No, it will.
3792000	3793000	It's great.
3794000	3795000	I know a guy at Snapchat.
3795000	3796000	You're saying we could do like an exclusive
3796000	3800000	Harmon Town Snapchat thing that puts a dick on your head
3800000	3801000	or whatever.
3801000	3802000	Exactly.
3802000	3804000	So, you would create the filter.
3804000	3805000	It's really easy to do.
3805000	3808000	Oh, and it only works in that geo-fenced area.
3808000	3809000	Yeah, you do geo-fence.
3809000	3812000	And for 20,000 square feet you can do,
3812000	3815000	for like $5 for the day, you can do it.
3815000	3816000	And how does that also apply?
3816000	3817000	Sorry, I don't mean to cut you off.
3817000	3818000	You're a fountain of information.
3818000	3820000	I'm like putting my thumb over you.
3821000	3826000	But is there something similar to do that with Instagram?
3826000	3828000	For Instagram it would be different.
3828000	3829000	You wouldn't necessarily do a filter.
3829000	3831000	Though someone could take it with their Snapchat,
3831000	3833000	take it with a filter, and then upload that to Instagram
3833000	3835000	because now Instagram doesn't have a limit.
3835000	3836000	You don't just have to do square photos.
3836000	3838000	You can do the vertical ones,
3838000	3840000	and then they could throw that on there.
3840000	3841000	So, you could do it either way.
3841000	3842000	I would say do it separately.
3842000	3843000	It's a little too much work.
3843000	3844000	You want something really quick.
3844000	3846000	So, you would have them send it to you.
3846000	3848000	Create a Harmon Town Snapchat account,
3849000	3850000	and then everyone would take photos
3850000	3851000	and then send it on their story,
3851000	3854000	but also send it to the Snapchat account for Harmon Town,
3854000	3855000	and you pick the favorite one.
3855000	3857000	You could broadcast them on the screen.
3857000	3858000	You could do a lot of different things with it.
3858000	3860000	Maybe we could use one of those hashtags.
3860000	3862000	You could use a hashtag.
3862000	3865000	All right, so how can I pervert this into a way to...
3865000	3867000	Because the only thing I need help with
3867000	3872000	is getting people into the Balboa Theater on the 22nd.
3872000	3874000	I'm saying don't come.
3874000	3877000	That's what we'll put on the Snapchat filter.
3877000	3880000	Anyone in the area will know.
3880000	3881000	Well, you could do it.
3881000	3883000	So, they would only be able to use the filter
3883000	3884000	if they were in that area,
3884000	3886000	and then if you'd have to take a photo with the filter,
3886000	3888000	or they'd have to tag themselves there.
3888000	3890000	They'd have to take a picture maybe with someone,
3890000	3893000	you know, something that shows that they were at the event,
3893000	3894000	or they just have to promote it themselves.
3894000	3896000	So, maybe they're not going, but they're saying go.
3896000	3897000	So, people who...
3897000	3898000	So, people who...
3898000	3901000	This is the age-old thing of anyone who comes to this thing
3901000	3903000	is eligible maybe for a thing that's like...
3903000	3904000	Yeah, to do something there.
3904000	3906000	At the top of that is a big deal.
3906000	3907000	The restaurants do that.
3907000	3909000	Like, the habit when they open something new,
3909000	3911000	they'll do that where you have to go
3911000	3913000	and you take a photo with their Snapchat filter,
3913000	3915000	and then they give you free swag with the habit on it,
3915000	3916000	which is not like...
3916000	3918000	Maybe some people are really into the habit,
3918000	3920000	so you want a habit hat.
3920000	3922000	But for other people who want Harmon Town swag,
3922000	3923000	they could take a photo,
3923000	3925000	and then if there's evidence they do that,
3925000	3926000	then they could get something free
3926000	3928000	when they check in with their ticket.
3928000	3931000	What if you and a friend...
3931000	3935000	But I want this to be contingent on all thousand seats filled.
3936000	3937000	You and a friend...
3937000	3939000	We could give them free habit hats.
3939000	3940000	The prize is...
3940000	3942000	Whatever the contest is,
3942000	3946000	the prize is that you and a friend,
3946000	3951000	because we want it to be just technically an abduction,
3951000	3957000	they come home with me and my friends on the party bus
3957000	3959000	that I booked to go back,
3959000	3963000	and then they come and they live in my house,
3963000	3965000	and they just come to work with me.
3965000	3967000	But the fine print is,
3967000	3970000	you're getting up at 7 a.m. sometimes,
3970000	3974000	and my dogs are going to...
3974000	3978000	Harvey will roll over and do a submissive pee on you.
3978000	3980000	I don't make breakfast.
3980000	3982000	You'll be drinking Soylent.
3982000	3984000	Yeah, you don't keep food in the house, really.
3984000	3986000	But you can stay in my...
3986000	3987000	I have a guest room,
3987000	3991000	and then you can just come...
3991000	3994000	If I could put you in a backpack, I would.
3994000	3997000	But you would just handcuff you to me,
3997000	3999000	and I would just write Rick and Morty,
3999000	4000000	and you'd be there,
4000000	4003000	and that would be thrilling for some people.
4003000	4006000	Yeah, I'm sure, yeah.
4006000	4009000	Even the chance at it might make a thousand people show up,
4009000	4011000	but maybe that's the contingency,
4011000	4013000	is a thousand people didn't show up,
4013000	4015000	so the top prize is a t-shirt.
4015000	4018000	That sounds great.
4018000	4020000	All right, we'll figure something like that out.
4020000	4021000	Sounds good.
4021000	4024000	I don't do stuff when I go home at night,
4024000	4027000	sit on a bowl of ice cream or look at...
4027000	4029000	I don't have a shoebox of Polaroids or anything,
4029000	4031000	so that's a resource I have
4031000	4033000	where I could just have a person...
4033000	4035000	This isn't an invitation to stalk me,
4035000	4038000	but I'm just saying my life is compatible
4038000	4040000	with just a person walking around.
4040000	4042000	That's what Spencer and Steve Levy are.
4042000	4044000	Oh, yeah.
4044000	4046000	We all cohabitate.
4046000	4048000	Yeah, we're just a family.
4048000	4049000	It's awesome.
4049000	4051000	Maybe it's a luxurious package.
4051000	4053000	I think that's what we did for the AIDS thing.
4053000	4054000	Oh, yeah.
4054000	4056000	Yeah, Rick and Morty.
4056000	4059000	Sorry, Jeff did a thing. It was great.
4059000	4062000	I don't know what you're talking about.
4062000	4065000	Rick and Morty did an AIDS thing.
4065000	4068000	Yeah, the more you donate it, you're eligible for a thing
4068000	4070000	where you do a voice on Rick and Morty,
4070000	4072000	and then I think you hang out.
4072000	4075000	We still got to do that, right?
4075000	4077000	Right? Yeah.
4077000	4080000	Yeah, you can't...
4080000	4083000	Dan, you were talking earlier about
4083000	4085000	hanging out in Comic-Con is kind of a bummer.
4085000	4087000	It's fun to have a little party space.
4087000	4090000	What if we had our own little party space?
4090000	4094000	We'll be hanging out at the Geek and Sundry Lounge.
4094000	4095000	Is that right?
4095000	4097000	Yeah, just go there.
4097000	4099000	It'll be fine.
4099000	4101000	What are they going to do?
4102000	4105000	All right, Savannah,
4105000	4107000	you want to see what this other guy has to say, maybe?
4107000	4108000	Yeah, sure.
4108000	4109000	All right.
4109000	4110000	You're not afraid of a little competition.
4110000	4112000	Why don't you come up, sir? You know who you are.
4119000	4121000	Dan, take it away.
4121000	4122000	Hello, sir.
4122000	4123000	Are you Luke?
4123000	4124000	I'm Zach.
4124000	4125000	Zach?
4125000	4126000	Yeah.
4126000	4127000	Wait, did you bring me the booze?
4127000	4128000	No.
4128000	4129000	No, that was Luke.
4129000	4130000	He looks like me, though.
4130000	4133000	That was another guy that was bald with a beard.
4133000	4135000	There are many of us here tonight.
4135000	4136000	Oh, yeah.
4136000	4138000	I'm among my people.
4138000	4141000	And it's just, you know, it's to beat the heat.
4141000	4143000	You're not a neo-Nazi.
4143000	4145000	No, I'm certainly not a neo-Nazi.
4145000	4148000	He's got one of those Hillary stars on his shirt.
4151000	4153000	Sorry, I didn't hear that.
4153000	4155000	Oh, stars of David on your shirt.
4155000	4157000	They're Chicago stars.
4157000	4159000	Yeah, you know...
4159000	4161000	They actually do look more like...
4161000	4162000	It's fine.
4162000	4163000	I don't like the placement, though,
4163000	4165000	because they're, like, right by my waist.
4165000	4166000	What are we doing?
4166000	4167000	We're getting to know Zach,
4167000	4169000	and we're welcoming him and not terrorizing him.
4169000	4172000	I want to, now that I know that.
4172000	4173000	All right.
4173000	4175000	Well, I'll fill you in more carefully.
4175000	4176000	Jesus Christ.
4176000	4177000	I know.
4177000	4178000	So the tail wags the dog around.
4178000	4179000	He's like this?
4179000	4183000	He's in a good mood, I think.
4183000	4184000	Yeah.
4184000	4185000	What's he really like?
4185000	4186000	Are you guys comfortable?
4186000	4188000	We want you to feel that way.
4188000	4189000	I'm...
4189000	4193000	As long as I'm amongst you and Dan and Jeff,
4193000	4194000	I'm comfortable.
4194000	4197000	Well, that's not very often in your life, apparently.
4197000	4198000	Savannah.
4198000	4199000	Nice to meet you.
4199000	4200000	Savannah with one in.
4200000	4201000	Zach, what were you going to say?
4201000	4203000	You said, just because I'm curious,
4203000	4205000	because I said I made the dumb Nazi joke
4205000	4207000	about your shaved head for those who are listening.
4207000	4208000	He has a shaved head.
4208000	4210000	And you said it's not to beat the heat,
4210000	4211000	and you didn't finish.
4211000	4214000	Well, actually, it's just simply because
4214000	4217000	I don't want to have a receding hairline,
4217000	4220000	and I've got a little bald spot back here.
4220000	4222000	And actually, I'm about three days past
4222000	4224000	the last time I shaved my head,
4224000	4226000	so you can start to see it a little bit.
4226000	4227000	Where do you do that?
4227000	4231000	Do you go to a barber, or do you just do it yourself now?
4231000	4234000	No, I just put shaving cream on it.
4234000	4237000	I got one of those mock 17 blade bits.
4237000	4238000	Oh, really?
4238000	4239000	Do you bic it?
4239000	4241000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4241000	4243000	That seems like a tremendous effort.
4243000	4245000	It's not, really.
4245000	4246000	It's really easy and big.
4246000	4247000	Very satisfying.
4247000	4249000	I just can't even begin to imagine,
4249000	4251000	like, every fucking consistible row.
4251000	4252000	It's not a string?
4252000	4253000	It's not a string?
4253000	4256000	No, I'm holding like a bic, like a...
4256000	4258000	No, not one of them.
4258000	4261000	I've got like the mock or Gillette something.
4261000	4265000	It's got like a rotating ball that has a bunch of...
4265000	4266000	A phantasm?
4266000	4267000	Two thousand?
4267000	4268000	Yes, I did say a phantasm.
4268000	4271000	Boy!
4271000	4274000	First the first metal ball comes in
4274000	4276000	and terrorizes your soul.
4276000	4278000	The second ball kidnaps your body,
4278000	4280000	fills it with formaldehyde and...
4280000	4281000	Fuck it.
4281000	4282000	Yeah.
4282000	4284000	How many of those balls were there?
4284000	4285000	Three.
4285000	4286000	There were three of them?
4286000	4287000	There were three.
4287000	4289000	I only ever saw phantasm, too.
4289000	4290000	Which was fucked up.
4290000	4291000	I thought...
4291000	4292000	I was going to a movie theater.
4292000	4294000	I was a kid, and it was a rated R movie,
4294000	4298000	and I was with adults, meaning, like, my brother's friends.
4298000	4301000	And, like, I didn't know the word phantasm.
4301000	4304000	I was confusing it with phantasia.
4304000	4305000	Oh.
4305000	4306000	And so I was like,
4306000	4308000	why are we going to see phantasm, too?
4308000	4312000	Who cares what happened to those broomsticks?
4312000	4314000	Clearly the lesson was don't play with magic
4314000	4315000	when the wizard's gone.
4315000	4318000	I think that lesson is, like, learned.
4318000	4319000	And I was like, what the hell's going on?
4319000	4320000	But I just want to fit in.
4320000	4323000	And there was a fucking crazy, really cool horror movie,
4323000	4324000	phantasm, too.
4324000	4326000	Imagine if the tall man had one of...
4326000	4329000	Had, like, the outfit that Mickey was wearing with the hat.
4329000	4330000	It would have been even better.
4330000	4331000	How is the...
4331000	4332000	What are the rules there?
4332000	4334000	You just put on a fucking hat,
4334000	4336000	and all of a sudden you can make animated golems
4336000	4339000	and shit out of brooms?
4339000	4341000	He had a book, I think, a spell book.
4341000	4342000	He just touched...
4342000	4344000	Oh, wait, maybe he did.
4344000	4346000	All right, that tracks.
4348000	4349000	I always thought that was, like,
4349000	4351000	high-level magic he was tapping into.
4351000	4352000	It was hard to believe.
4352000	4353000	Well, it was pretty...
4353000	4354000	I mean, he made an army of...
4354000	4356000	Self-replicating broom men.
4356000	4357000	Yeah, that's crazy.
4357000	4359000	But then he gets more than he bargained for
4359000	4360000	at some point, right?
4360000	4362000	An army of self-replicating broom men.
4362000	4363000	That's how magic...
4363000	4364000	That's what magic does.
4364000	4366000	It's always more than what you bargained for.
4366000	4368000	That's what it says on the cover of that book.
4368000	4370000	All right, so...
4370000	4372000	What are your thoughts about...
4372000	4375000	And, listen, bonus points for if you have thought
4375000	4379000	about taking it into the Balboa specificity.
4381000	4385000	How do I move asses into seats for July 22nd?
4385000	4386000	Well, I'm in advertising.
4386000	4387000	I'm in digital advertising,
4387000	4388000	so I designed...
4388000	4389000	Fingers.
4389000	4391000	Digital ads and fingers.
4391000	4392000	Digital fingers.
4392000	4393000	Digits.
4393000	4394000	Like, digital advertising is the easiest,
4394000	4395000	because you're like,
4395000	4397000	hey, you have 10 of them.
4397000	4398000	Yeah.
4398000	4399000	Why not 11?
4399000	4400000	Yeah.
4400000	4401000	That's all.
4401000	4405000	I mean, digital advertising is essentially this.
4406000	4407000	Sorry, I'm so sorry.
4407000	4408000	Here they are.
4408000	4409000	They're all here.
4409000	4410000	All 10 of them.
4410000	4412000	Zach, just pretend Dan's not here.
4414000	4415000	Too late.
4416000	4417000	Um...
4418000	4419000	I...
4419000	4422000	So you shave your head, but you leave the beard.
4422000	4423000	Okay.
4423000	4426000	This is how I produce a jawline.
4426000	4427000	Oh, okay.
4427000	4428000	I know what you mean, man.
4428000	4430000	If I don't have this, I look like a muppet.
4430000	4431000	Yeah.
4431000	4433000	What does that term neck beard mean, you know?
4433000	4434000	I always get so scared, because they're like...
4434000	4437000	It's when there's no defining line underneath.
4437000	4438000	But that's good.
4438000	4439000	I mean, I'm not...
4439000	4440000	It's a pen.
4440000	4441000	You have made a defining line, but...
4441000	4443000	If you have a good, strong jawline,
4443000	4446000	if you're like Jay Cutler from the Bears, who's...
4446000	4447000	Right.
4447000	4450000	Who can do that and get away with it?
4450000	4453000	When it's bad, it looks kind of like a mane.
4453000	4455000	Like you're just a fat lion.
4458000	4459000	Like it's really...
4459000	4460000	It's not a beard on your chin.
4460000	4463000	It's like this hairy ring around your neck.
4463000	4464000	Yeah.
4464000	4466000	That's like the failure of the neck beard, I think.
4466000	4467000	Yeah.
4467000	4472000	So Zach, when you're doing the beard, is that all razor?
4472000	4473000	Are you doing electric around that?
4473000	4474000	How do you...
4474000	4475000	Oh, no.
4475000	4476000	This is...
4476000	4477000	Laser precise.
4477000	4478000	This is with a Bic too.
4478000	4479000	Really?
4479000	4480000	I actually have two razors that I use.
4480000	4483000	I use the bald Gillette 17 blade thing for this.
4483000	4484000	It has a Bic for this.
4484000	4487000	Am I wrong in saying exactly you also go on top of the mustache?
4487000	4488000	Yes.
4488000	4491000	I've had a beard since I was about three years old.
4491000	4492000	Whoa.
4492000	4498000	So I've been able to perfect the grooming of the beard.
4498000	4499000	Well, then let me ask you this.
4499000	4500000	I grow a nice mustache or a beard.
4501000	4504000	I have very splotchy, patchy, Johnny Depp used car sales.
4504000	4505000	Well, you have a very beautiful face.
4505000	4506000	You don't need to have...
4506000	4511000	I mean, facial hair, I think, is for people that are kind of ashamed of their face.
4511000	4514000	Like I am.
4514000	4517000	But you're a very handsome guy, Zach.
4517000	4519000	I've got a great beard.
4519000	4520000	Are you saying if you...
4520000	4521000	But you have great hair.
4521000	4524000	Are you saying if we saw you without that beard that we would go like, oh my God.
4524000	4525000	Yeah, I wouldn't be.
4525000	4526000	I wouldn't be up here right now.
4526000	4527000	Have you ever seen...
4527000	4529000	Don't you get a little mad when you see...
4529000	4531000	Daniel Gilly's last week, he had a beard.
4531000	4534000	Like when handsome guys have beards, like it is though.
4534000	4535000	It pisses you off.
4535000	4536000	Yeah.
4536000	4537000	That's gay.
4537000	4538000	It's the whole...
4538000	4540000	It's like, you can tell.
4540000	4542000	It's like, yeah, it is weird.
4542000	4544000	It almost looks like they're in disguise.
4544000	4548000	It's the whole lumberjack, lumbersexual thing that goes on.
4548000	4550000	Lumbersexual.
4550000	4552000	I kind of have to...
4552000	4553000	I'm into mannequins.
4553000	4555000	I'm kind of a lumbersexual.
4556000	4557000	Do you guys...
4557000	4559000	Just the leg though, right?
4559000	4563000	I got this haircut because I was on Larry King now.
4563000	4565000	Larry King now.
4565000	4569000	It's like, TV Guide magazine.
4569000	4577000	I got a haircut because I was going to be on webisodes of what used to be TV.
4577000	4581000	And I thought it was a great haircut.
4581000	4584000	And then Cody was laughing because she said that in the back,
4584000	4586000	he made me look like a Lego.
4591000	4592000	I saw that.
4592000	4594000	It's a little too precise.
4594000	4595000	She's like, really?
4595000	4597000	She was like taking pictures of me from behind.
4597000	4601000	She wanted to do a split screen with like a Lego guy.
4601000	4602000	Yeah.
4602000	4605000	And I guess I looked at it and I was like, yeah, I guess I was pretty straight
4605000	4606000	when he did that.
4606000	4608000	But I mean, I would have never...
4608000	4609000	All right.
4609000	4610000	All right.
4610000	4611000	So, digital advertising.
4611000	4612000	What do you think?
4612000	4615000	What do we do to get some butts in the Balboa's?
4615000	4620000	My initial instinct is to think visually when advertising and you've got three
4620000	4624000	strapping young men up here that are part of the podcast that...
4624000	4628000	I think we just do a shot with you guys in the same outfits that they're wearing
4628000	4629000	and now you see me.
4634000	4635000	I don't think that's gonna...
4635000	4636000	I mean...
4636000	4637000	It is...
4637000	4639000	You listen to it.
4639000	4640000	Yeah.
4640000	4641000	It's a podcast.
4643000	4645000	We don't have a budget for like a bus stop ad.
4645000	4648000	All I can think of is bribery.
4648000	4649000	Show up.
4649000	4650000	That's what I'm saying.
4650000	4651000	Prizes.
4651000	4652000	And all the promises.
4652000	4653000	Like, okay.
4653000	4654000	So sometimes when we go abroad...
4654000	4655000	We build a wall.
4656000	4661000	Well, sometimes the traveling shows are the drunkest of all.
4661000	4662000	Like, maybe...
4662000	4665000	What if it was like, okay, I promise you...
4665000	4666000	Like, what are some features of a show?
4666000	4668000	Like, I'm not gonna say I'm not gonna be drunk.
4668000	4669000	But I will say...
4669000	4672000	I won't be blackout drunk when I take the stage.
4672000	4675000	And to prove that...
4675000	4677000	I'll prepare bits.
4677000	4678000	Like, what's like a bit...
4678000	4680000	If I were to do Savannah...
4680000	4682000	If I were to do bits...
4682000	4684000	Like, top ten lists...
4684000	4686000	Like, what kind of...
4686000	4689000	Like, what could come out of the Harmon town psyche that you think would be like
4689000	4692000	a good kind of feature that you...
4693000	4696000	You know, like Harmon's thoughts.
4696000	4700000	Or, you know, like...
4700000	4701000	I'm putting you on the spot.
4701000	4702000	Oh, no, that's okay.
4702000	4704000	Well, from the Comic Con show last year,
4704000	4708000	like, kind of going over some of the things you saw at Comic Con
4708000	4712000	that maybe you could, you know, then talk about for an extended period of time.
4712000	4715000	So maybe your top ten worst moments at Comic Con
4715000	4717000	are the moments that made you cringe
4717000	4719000	or moments that really made you...
4719000	4722000	I think, Dan, you should dress as Poison Ivy.
4725000	4726000	Again, that's not...
4726000	4728000	I mean, they're gonna be like, okay, cool, dress like Poison Ivy.
4728000	4729000	I'll look that up on...
4729000	4731000	If you can guarantee, like, guests,
4731000	4733000	but maybe don't say exactly who they are,
4733000	4735000	but, like, kind of give hints as to who they might be
4735000	4737000	that are vague enough that people won't be disappointed.
4737000	4738000	Yeah, that's what we do, Dan.
4738000	4739000	You just...
4739000	4741000	We just say that we have an awesome guest.
4741000	4743000	And also, Spencer and I are both gonna...
4743000	4745000	Both gonna dress as Slave Leia.
4745000	4746000	And Star...
4746000	4747000	Yeah.
4748000	4750000	And Star Wars 8 is gonna make an appearance.
4752000	4753000	Curtis Armstrong.
4753000	4754000	We'll text...
4754000	4756000	We'll text Curtis Armstrong.
4756000	4757000	I heard him.
4757000	4758000	Yeah.
4758000	4759000	By the way, where is Curtis?
4759000	4760000	Have we lost him forever?
4760000	4761000	What's going on?
4761000	4762000	Thank you, Zach.
4762000	4764000	What happened to Curtis?
4764000	4766000	He said some racist shit to me in the parking lot.
4766000	4768000	Oh, no.
4768000	4770000	And I was like, dude, that's cool, but, like,
4770000	4771000	people should know you're racist.
4771000	4776000	And he's like, I don't care about my image, Dan.
4776000	4778000	And I said, yes, you do.
4778000	4780000	And he said, no, dude.
4783000	4787000	People with different colored skin from me
4787000	4789000	are less people.
4791000	4794000	And I was like, Curtis, if anyone can hear you saying this right now,
4794000	4795000	they'd be so brokenhearted.
4795000	4797000	And he said, that's the point, baby.
4798000	4800000	That guy and Christopher Walken sound the exact same.
4800000	4801000	The exact same.
4801000	4802000	All right.
4802000	4803000	Wait.
4803000	4804000	Curtis Armstrong, I think I only have...
4804000	4806000	Zach, do you have any impressions?
4806000	4807000	I had a party.
4807000	4809000	Who can you break out as an impression?
4809000	4810000	Hasn't been on the show.
4810000	4812000	I mean, I can do a slight walk-in, but...
4812000	4813000	Give me a slight walk-in.
4813000	4815000	Can you give me a slight walk-in ordering breakfast?
4815000	4816000	Right.
4816000	4817000	We'll leave you.
4817000	4818000	Make sure Curtis Armstrong is...
4818000	4820000	Make sure we connect with him and see if he can do the show
4820000	4821000	as well.
4821000	4822000	Yeah.
4822000	4823000	Yeah.
4823000	4824000	Make sure Curtis Armstrong is...
4824000	4827000	Make sure we connect with him and see if he can do the show
4827000	4828000	at the Balboa.
4828000	4829000	And I'll pay him.
4829000	4831000	Tell him he's got us over a barrel.
4834000	4835000	And then if you come...
4835000	4836000	All right.
4836000	4837000	If you come to the Balboa show...
4837000	4838000	Which he shouldn't.
4840000	4841000	Guaranteed...
4843000	4844000	Photograph...
4846000	4847000	Parking lot...
4847000	4849000	Parking lot HJs.
4849000	4850000	I want...
4851000	4854000	I never really do this except at this show anyway,
4854000	4856000	but when we go out of town, I usually...
4856000	4858000	Well, actually, I've been entering a phase where I'm kind
4858000	4860000	of like, yeah, I don't want to do the thing.
4860000	4864000	So guaranteed, for sure, no matter how many of you
4864000	4867000	show up at the Balboa, if you paid to get in,
4867000	4870000	then part of that price is you're guaranteed...
4870000	4873000	We'll have to figure out where to go, possibly.
4873000	4877000	Maybe they'll need the theater, but I'll do a whole line thing
4877000	4879000	or figure out how you get a picture.
4879000	4880000	You get a picture.
4880000	4881000	You get a picture.
4881000	4882000	It sounds...
4882000	4883000	I've tried to understand.
4883000	4885000	I'm a writer, so it sounds weird to try to sell that
4885000	4886000	because it's like a thing.
4886000	4887000	But that would be...
4887000	4889000	That, to me, is like a basic thing.
4889000	4890000	Like, oh, it's $24.
4890000	4892000	We're driving to San Diego.
4892000	4896000	I'm definitely going to get a photograph, for sure.
4896000	4897000	In good lighting.
4898000	4900000	Why are you shaking your head, Steve?
4900000	4902000	Oh, because it's a thousand people and...
4904000	4907000	It'll take technically until Monday to do it.
4908000	4910000	Well, I've done it before.
4911000	4915000	So you're going to debut the Justice League trailer
4915000	4918000	and make a fake Justice League trailer and...
4919000	4920000	Oh, I could show something.
4920000	4921000	Write that down.
4921000	4924000	Let me bring a Rick and Morty clip in secret.
4929000	4933000	Because it's right before we drop all the Harmon Quest episodes,
4933000	4935000	let's just show all the Harmon Quest episodes.
4935000	4936000	It'll be after.
4936000	4937000	It'll be after.
4937000	4938000	Even though CISO's not coming to that,
4938000	4940000	and then they have no part of it.
4940000	4942000	Comic-Con's after we drop Harmon Quest.
4942000	4945000	Speaking of which, we just wrapped Harmon Quest.
4950000	4952000	11 days.
4952000	4955000	11 days until you got to get CISO.
4956000	4957000	All right.
4957000	4960000	If you come to the Balboa Theater on...
4960000	4962000	July 22nd.
4962000	4963000	July 22nd.
4963000	4966000	I will be there on stage.
4966000	4969000	Do you think they have airplay capability?
4969000	4972000	Do you think we could get them to do a projection thing?
4973000	4974000	No, we can't.
4974000	4975000	We'll look into this.
4975000	4976000	No, we'll do that.
4976000	4977000	I will...
4978000	4979000	I'll write...
4981000	4982000	I'll write...
4983000	4986000	A special Comic-Con episode of Rick and Morty.
4988000	4989000	Live.
4989000	4990000	No, it should be more...
4990000	4991000	I'm sorry.
4991000	4992000	Live.
4992000	4994000	I'll write the community movie.
4996000	4998000	Or the first act of it.
4998000	5001000	I'll get as much through it as I can while you watch.
5001000	5002000	I'll start...
5003000	5006000	You'll just see the final draft up on the screen.
5006000	5010000	Yeah, fade in and I'll start writing the community movie
5010000	5012000	until the show starts.
5012000	5013000	Yeah, yeah.
5014000	5015000	And I will...
5015000	5016000	Yeah.
5016000	5017000	I like that.
5017000	5018000	And then prizes.
5018000	5020000	And then there'll be prizes.
5021000	5023000	And Spencer's going to address this poison ivy.
5024000	5028000	Savannah's going to be there doing a Cirque du Soleil thing.
5029000	5031000	She'll do her aerial ribbon act.
5031000	5032000	It's amazing.
5032000	5033000	You have to see it.
5033000	5034000	All right.
5034000	5037000	Well, thanks to our PR department, Savannah.
5037000	5039000	Zach and Savannah, everybody.
5042000	5043000	All right.
5043000	5044000	Thank you.
5044000	5045000	Thank you.
5046000	5047000	Thank you.
5047000	5048000	Thank you.
5049000	5051000	What a great generation, Jeff.
5051000	5052000	Thank you, Zach.
5052000	5056000	You know, they say these millennials that they're pieces of shit.
5059000	5060000	I don't see it.
5060000	5063000	But you fundamentally disagree with that.
5063000	5064000	Yeah, I do.
5064000	5065000	I see hope in them.
5065000	5068000	What do you think separates the millennials from our generation?
5068000	5073000	I think, you know, I think they're more dishonest about how racist they are.
5074000	5077000	They've found new ways to tap dance around it.
5077000	5082000	They're the barishnikovs of actual racism.
5087000	5092000	They come to the table more Apple compatible, for sure.
5093000	5094000	That's always good.
5096000	5100000	I don't think they're worried about Y2K as much as my generation did.
5103000	5105000	Do you want to come up here?
5105000	5106000	Yeah.
5106000	5107000	Yeah.
5107000	5108000	You can't say it.
5108000	5109000	Okay.
5109000	5110000	All right.
5110000	5111000	All right.
5111000	5116000	Please, everybody, please welcome my coworker, John Eisen.
5123000	5124000	Is it just Eisen?
5124000	5126000	It's Eisen, actually.
5126000	5128000	Where's the I?
5128000	5129000	It's silent.
5129000	5130000	Yeah.
5130000	5131000	Yeah.
5131000	5132000	All right.
5132000	5134000	Your last name is E-I-D-S-O-N.
5134000	5135000	Where's your buddy?
5135000	5138000	Well, he's off in Tahoe for Fourth of July.
5138000	5140000	So he's going to be very sad that he wasn't here.
5140000	5143000	John, whose name I just learned isn't his partner's name Nick.
5143000	5145000	You're really selling that I'm a coworker here.
5145000	5146000	Yeah.
5147000	5153000	He's, we sold a idea to FX called Happy City, which is going to be like,
5153000	5157000	it's like a Thomas the Tank Engine kind of thing, but it's like,
5157000	5159000	it's friends and they're hanging out.
5159000	5160000	Yeah.
5160000	5164000	It's a taxi and a helicopter and an ambulance and another taxi.
5164000	5165000	Yeah.
5165000	5166000	Yeah.
5167000	5168000	Yeah.
5168000	5169000	And they hang out.
5169000	5170000	They're millennial vehicles.
5170000	5171000	I think they're sold out already.
5171000	5173000	In the big city, Happy City.
5173000	5176000	And it's hard, it's hard to be in the Happy City,
5176000	5180000	especially when like one of the characters, and I'm not going to spoil it,
5180000	5182000	it's Tyler the Taxi.
5183000	5185000	You're not that happy.
5186000	5187000	Oh, shit.
5187000	5191000	But really it's just, we've been calling it friends or Seinfeld without arms.
5191000	5192000	Yeah.
5192000	5193000	Yeah.
5194000	5197000	When we sold the show, I don't think we realized how hard it was going to be
5197000	5199000	to write for characters that can't pick things up.
5200000	5204000	You wouldn't believe how many fucking conversations we had.
5204000	5209000	That's the thing, people don't understand like tonality in television
5209000	5214000	is like this totally fractal continuum based thing.
5214000	5221000	There is no like, oh, is it going to be funny like Chappelle show?
5221000	5224000	Or is it going to be funny like Larry Sanders?
5224000	5227000	It's like, no, it's like there's questions that you don't know
5227000	5229000	that you don't have the answers to until you ask them.
5229000	5231000	Like, for instance, on Rick and Morty,
5231000	5235000	the whole big decision we had to make when we were writing the pilot for Rick and Morty,
5235000	5238000	Justin and I, we had to have like a three-hour conversation.
5238000	5243000	And the end of it all was just saying, look,
5243000	5246000	I don't know how to define the rules of the universe,
5246000	5248000	but we're just going to say,
5248000	5252000	if a kid comes through a portal into his high school cafeteria,
5252000	5256000	it doesn't change his social status within the high school.
5256000	5259000	It's more like he came in on a skateboard.
5259000	5261000	Like he came in through the portal, but he fell down.
5261000	5266000	Like the cute girl that he has a crush on says,
5266000	5268000	did you just come through a portal?
5268000	5270000	Like, did you just do that?
5270000	5272000	But she doesn't mean like, is there a God?
5272000	5274000	Like she, and are you the Messiah?
5274000	5276000	And does this change everything?
5276000	5279000	It's not even like pulling up in a Ferrari in the eighties.
5279000	5283000	It's like, it's, it's just like, like, so, so you make these decisions.
5283000	5285000	So we had to make the decision that these,
5285000	5289000	these are cars and helicopters and fire trucks and shit,
5289000	5293000	but, and everything's alive, but they have to have apartments.
5293000	5297000	And the apartments also have to have personalities.
5297000	5298000	Yeah. So, so yeah, if you,
5298000	5302000	if you come to this show with questions about internal logic,
5302000	5304000	you're, you're, you're purposely fucked.
5304000	5305000	Leave your logic at the door.
5305000	5309000	Donny the door.
5309000	5312000	Are other things than humans and vehicles alive?
5312000	5314000	Like, yeah, the whole city is alive.
5314000	5316000	It's kind of, there's people.
5316000	5322000	Yeah. But, but we, we kind of see the people like flies or flies or horses.
5322000	5325000	See flies and it's kind of brushing them off.
5325000	5329000	Yeah. So like taxis like take them and dump them off or like, but like,
5329000	5333000	but like, yeah, like if your friend's an ambulance and then he's like,
5333000	5337000	Hey, Hey, Tyler, do you want, do you want some people?
5337000	5338000	Yeah, I do. That's my job.
5338000	5340000	And then like, he pulls up and like put,
5340000	5343000	throws some people from the ambulance into the taxi,
5343000	5345000	but then your boss will yell at you about that later.
5345000	5347000	Cause you're not supposed to do that.
5347000	5350000	Like an ambulance is supposed to take the people to the hospital.
5350000	5352000	You're not supposed to just because you're a taxi,
5352000	5354000	take people out of an ambulance.
5354000	5355000	And the hospital also being a character.
5355000	5357000	Do the cars, let's say it's just two cars hanging out,
5357000	5358000	like the best friends.
5358000	5361000	Do they, do they go out to a restaurant and sit at a car restaurant?
5361000	5363000	Yes, but it's not a car restaurant.
5363000	5365000	It's just a restaurant because they're not drinking motor oil.
5365000	5369000	They're eating pancakes and floating drinks to their places.
5369000	5370000	Like, are they seated? Like,
5370000	5374000	I just pull up to the table, but then, but then if there's like a,
5374000	5377000	yeah, we had a long time. Cause like, if somebody's like,
5377000	5379000	if somebody's talking and it's like clear,
5379000	5381000	like if there's a subplot about like, well,
5381000	5383000	I think that person might be gay, but they're not admitting it yet.
5383000	5385000	And then there's these two people have been talking about it,
5385000	5387000	but this person says something that this person,
5387000	5390000	this car and this, the helicopters like, like saying something,
5390000	5394000	but then you pan over to the other taxi and they don't have arms.
5394000	5397000	So there's just a knife and fork floating in front of them,
5397000	5399000	but their eyes are going.
5401000	5402000	All right.
5402000	5403000	Which is a universal language.
5403000	5405000	Yeah. It's like, like, like, like they don't have arms.
5405000	5409000	So it's just a knife and fork floating, but they're going, no.
5409000	5412000	See somebody's apartment.
5412000	5414000	Is there like a shot of a car just laying in bed?
5414000	5417000	Like, like, like wondering what he's doing with his life.
5417000	5419000	If he's sick, if a car is sick, does he, is he in bed?
5419000	5422000	We haven't, I guess so.
5422000	5424000	I feel like we're going to have to get back to you on that one.
5424000	5427000	Because the alternative would be that he's at Jiffy Lube and it's dumb.
5427000	5428000	Yeah.
5428000	5430000	Once you start Yankovic-ing it, you're fucked.
5430000	5431000	Yeah.
5431000	5436000	Initially, we pictured them going into houses or apartments
5436000	5440000	and then going to their rooms and they have a little garage inside of their room
5440000	5443000	that they go into, which became a little too cute, I think.
5443000	5444000	Yeah.
5444000	5446000	So now I was saying for a while, well, when they hang out,
5446000	5448000	they should just be at an intersection.
5449000	5450000	Yeah.
5450000	5452000	But then it's like, well, how many episodes of this are we going to do
5452000	5456000	and how much of a 25-year-old's life is about cohabitation
5456000	5459000	and about landlord conflict and about property value
5459000	5461000	and aren't they going to get texts?
5461000	5464000	And for a while, I was like, well, maybe they don't get texts.
5464000	5465000	Let's rise above it.
5465000	5468000	But I was like, there's no fucking way.
5468000	5471000	The cars just have phones that will just float out in front of them
5471000	5474000	and then they'll text each other and they live in apartments.
5474000	5477000	If the cars, let's say one of your main characters is a car
5477000	5480000	and goes to, like, would they go to a rock concert?
5480000	5482000	And if they go to the rock concert, would it all just be cars?
5482000	5484000	Would there be people there too or just cars?
5484000	5487000	There would be people, like, if you squint or freeze frame,
5487000	5490000	there will be people climbing all over the place.
5490000	5494000	There is a plane of the universe where this show is actually about the people
5494000	5497000	who don't understand why their cars are doing all this.
5497000	5501000	But we had a long time where I was saying,
5501000	5503000	oh, you have to hold it up to both realities,
5503000	5506000	where every episode, if you watch every frame,
5506000	5509000	everything makes sense in some weird way.
5509000	5513000	Like, the way that we're controlled by brain chemicals.
5513000	5515000	So I was like, why did that guy take a hatchet to his family?
5515000	5520000	Well, because he's schizophrenic but also had a little bit,
5520000	5523000	just a touch of Asperger's and then it was Tuesday.
5523000	5525000	But the truth is...
5525000	5527000	Some forensic files.
5527000	5531000	You know, it's like, what is the difference between free will and destiny?
5531000	5533000	We don't really know.
5533000	5535000	We just feel like we're making these choices.
5535000	5538000	Cars just feel like they're having these stories where they're like,
5538000	5540000	fuck you, buddy, and then they drive away.
5540000	5543000	But in reality, on the people's side, if you look at it,
5543000	5547000	you can see two tiny people that are, like, mad at each other as well.
5547000	5549000	But I think we let that go.
5549000	5552000	Yeah, now it's just cars that go to a rock concert, probably.
5552000	5554000	And there's people, like, just climbing all over the place.
5554000	5557000	Maybe we'll have the Easter egg of what the people are doing.
5557000	5561000	But ultimately, I think it's kind of maybe the Team America thing of,
5561000	5564000	how do the cars play basketball? Let's figure it out.
5564000	5567000	We haven't made it yet, so that's going to be the next step.
5567000	5568000	So the cars are playing basketball.
5568000	5570000	What is the diameter of the basketball?
5570000	5572000	Who made the basketball?
5572000	5575000	No, it's proportionate to the car.
5575000	5579000	So, like, oh, if a person got out of that car, that'd be a giant basketball.
5579000	5581000	No, it's a basketball for the cars.
5581000	5582000	It's dribbling next to them.
5582000	5584000	They have no arm.
5584000	5586000	Deal with it.
5586000	5590000	And the way we're dealing with it is we're going to have a live-action mayor.
5590000	5592000	I think we should put out the call right now.
5592000	5594000	We should be Michael Shannon, actor Michael Shannon.
5594000	5597000	If anyone knows him.
5597000	5601000	And in between scenes, we'd like to just go back to the mayor's office
5601000	5604000	and have a fucking freaky Michael Shannon,
5604000	5609000	just, like, intensely ask a lot of the questions that you were about to ask.
5609000	5613000	And then answer them with, like, I don't know, being mayor doesn't mean I'm in control.
5613000	5618000	You know, like, all I know is when two friends are jealous of a third friend,
5618000	5620000	like, that shit goes down.
5620000	5623000	The stories are held together by emotional.
5623000	5625000	Because also, like, guess what?
5625000	5629000	When you're watching Seinfeld, why does everybody always sit on one side of the table?
5629000	5632000	I mean, because you can't turn you back to the camera.
5632000	5636000	It's just as unnatural as if everyone was cars.
5636000	5639000	There's always a reason why everything's fucking weird.
5639000	5641000	Maybe we're all cars.
5641000	5642000	Maybe we are all cars.
5642000	5643000	That's what the show makes you ask.
5643000	5645000	How often do you wonder where a basketball came from?
5645000	5646000	Yeah.
5646000	5647000	Yeah.
5647000	5648000	Yeah.
5648000	5649000	Who made this orange?
5649000	5650000	How much thought have you put into that?
5650000	5651000	Yeah.
5651000	5652000	Yeah.
5652000	5653000	Does that answer your question?
5653000	5654000	Yeah, it does.
5654000	5656000	I think it's going to be a really good show.
5656000	5657000	So we're still writing it?
5657000	5658000	I want to watch the show.
5658000	5662000	Because also, like, I want to watch that show and wonder.
5662000	5664000	I want to have a lot of questions about it.
5664000	5667000	And I want to find out that they're not going to be answered,
5667000	5668000	or they're going to be answered very slowly.
5668000	5671000	Because remember ABC's Cavemen?
5671000	5672000	Yes, I do.
5672000	5677000	That show could have lasted 100 episodes if it had just accepted that it was fucked up.
5677000	5678000	It was fucked up.
5679000	5683000	I still have the pilot that never aired of Cavemen,
5683000	5685000	which was way more racist,
5685000	5690000	where the Cavemen were really good dancers and had big dicks
5690000	5694000	and had lots of rhythm and stuff like that.
5694000	5698000	They dropped that for the unerring pilot.
5698000	5700000	We all have, okay, here's what we do.
5700000	5703000	Balboa Theater, July 22nd.
5703000	5705000	You're going to have to raise those same prizes.
5705000	5708000	We show the unaired pilot of Cavemen.
5708000	5711000	Holy smoke.
5711000	5715000	They asked me to audition for that one, and I declined.
5715000	5718000	Even Saturday night, I know a lot of people that auditioned for Cavemen
5718000	5720000	and didn't get the job.
5720000	5722000	Well, Nick Kroll did.
5722000	5724000	That's how I met Nick Kroll.
5724000	5727000	I found out he was the smart caveman in Cavemen.
5727000	5729000	He was the one with the glasses.
5729000	5731000	I asked him 500 Cavemen questions.
5731000	5733000	He answered every single one.
5733000	5735000	It was the first time I'd ever met him, and I was like,
5735000	5737000	that guy's cool, man.
5737000	5739000	He did not.
5739000	5741000	Cavemen's worth a look.
5741000	5743000	It's worth watching four episodes.
5743000	5745000	How many did they make?
5745000	5747000	I think four aired, but they probably made six.
5747000	5750000	It is fucking bonkers.
5750000	5752000	What year was this?
5752000	5754000	I don't know.
5754000	5756000	Wow.
5756000	5758000	Is Nick Kroll here right now?
5758000	5760000	2006 sounds good.
5760000	5762000	That sounds about right.
5762000	5764000	Yeah, I have it at my place.
5764000	5766000	Please come over and watch it with me.
5766000	5767000	It's really good.
5767000	5769000	All 1,000 people.
5769000	5770000	Treat yourself.
5770000	5772000	Find the pilot to Mr. Ed.
5772000	5776000	It's one of the funniest goddamn half-hours of TV you'll ever see in your life.
5776000	5780000	So, John, tell everybody that I'm fun to work with.
5780000	5783000	I wasn't done with Mr. Ed, Dad.
5783000	5786000	Well, I'm not fun, but just tell them it's amazing to work with me.
5786000	5787000	It's so amazing.
5787000	5788000	For example.
5788000	5795000	For example, at his house, you're greeted by his dogs immediately.
5795000	5797000	Did you get peed on?
5797000	5798000	Just a little.
5798000	5799000	Just a little.
5799000	5802000	Well, Harvey growls at me a lot.
5802000	5803000	But he doesn't know what growling means.
5803000	5804000	But he doesn't know what that means.
5804000	5806000	He thinks it means play with me.
5806000	5807000	Oh, sorry.
5807000	5808000	I wasn't selling this well enough.
5808000	5809000	No, no.
5809000	5815000	Well, there is the Apple TV thing because I try to put it up on the screen and then I...
5815000	5820000	Yeah, the most embarrassing things pop up whenever Dan turns his Apple TV on.
5820000	5827000	Started taking photos to Dan shame of the Kelly Clarkson songs revealed.
5827000	5828000	Yeah.
5828000	5830000	Of last played on the Apple TV.
5830000	5831000	That's fun.
5831000	5832000	We have a good laugh about that.
5832000	5833000	Yeah.
5833000	5834000	Yeah.
5834000	5835000	Hey, welcome, guys.
5835000	5836000	All right.
5836000	5837000	Let's open a laptop.
5837000	5838000	Apple TV's not working.
5838000	5840000	It'll be bitching about it for a while, like swearing and going like,
5840000	5841000	fucking technology.
5841000	5842000	Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck.
5842000	5844000	He's got a fish tank that he's still learning how to work.
5844000	5850000	Dan comes up and it says Kelly Clarkson, whatever makes you stronger, whatever the fuck it is.
5850000	5851000	And it's like...
5851000	5857000	As Nick pointed out, the progress indicator is five seconds before the end of the song.
5857000	5858000	Which means like...
5858000	5859000	It's like there's unmistakables.
5859000	5862000	It's like there's nothing you could never really get out of it.
5862000	5863000	Yeah, there's no...
5863000	5864000	I got hacked.
5864000	5866000	My account got hacked.
5866000	5867000	It's that...
5867000	5868000	No, you listen to the song.
5868000	5871000	You danced to it in your underwear.
5871000	5874000	And then the doorbell rang.
5874000	5875000	How are the fish doing?
5875000	5876000	Are the fish thriving?
5876000	5878000	He has a hard time dealing with the light.
5878000	5879000	That's okay now, yeah.
5879000	5880000	Oh, okay, good.
5880000	5882000	Thank God for Golan.
5882000	5884000	Yeah, Golan, the fish guy.
5884000	5887000	He's important to the household.
5887000	5890000	Yeah, I'm a dick to the aquarium guy.
5890000	5893000	Didn't he steal the remote?
5893000	5896000	Wasn't there a hubbub with this remote?
5896000	5899000	The light didn't work for a while and he didn't tell me you have to open the cabinet
5899000	5902000	in order for the remote for the light on the fish tank to work.
5902000	5903000	Right.
5903000	5905000	That means it's not a remote.
5910000	5912000	It's a detachable button pad.
5915000	5916000	Because if you have to open the cab...
5916000	5918000	I mean, not that I needed it to be remote.
5918000	5922000	I'd love a button under the cabinet that like just turns the light on
5922000	5923000	so you can see the fish.
5923000	5926000	The fish have a light cycle.
5926000	5931000	It lets the fish live their natural life in a two-foot tank.
5931000	5935000	They'd go crazy going like, why isn't it morning yet?
5935000	5937000	Why isn't it nighttime?
5937000	5941000	And so it goes around a cycle, but like the only time people are going to come over to my place
5941000	5944000	and see the fish is there in their nighttime.
5944000	5946000	So it's a black tank.
5946000	5948000	So I just want to...
5948000	5950000	I want to hit a button and go, there's the fish.
5950000	5952000	Look, there's a prawn.
5953000	5955000	So I went back and forth with this guy.
5955000	5956000	And I'm a huge dick.
5956000	5958000	I read one of my texts when I was going through the divorce.
5958000	5960000	I did this whole...
5960000	5962000	Yeah, you were quoting Edward Albee.
5962000	5964000	Well, you were there.
5964000	5966000	Yeah, I said...
5966000	5971000	This is like the fifth time I asked about the remote not working for the light.
5971000	5977000	And then I tagged it with a generic, if you ever want to just be a dick that seems intellectual.
5977000	5980000	I said, I feel like I'm in an Edward Albee play.
5982000	5984000	Which one?
5984000	5986000	Who's turning the tank on?
5989000	5992000	And then he was like, no, and he called me and he's like, he's just going to open the door.
5992000	5994000	It's not a good way to end the show.
5997000	6001000	So it sounds like a lot of people are going to watch on FX when we have our Happy City show.
6003000	6006000	After they pick it up, after we turn in the script.
6006000	6007000	So we've got some work to do.
6007000	6011000	Sorry, I keep pushing the meetings where I have to do a pass on the script.
6012000	6015000	John, what's your least favorite thing about working with Dan?
6015000	6018000	What's the downside to working with Dan Harmon?
6022000	6024000	His unavailability.
6025000	6027000	Oh, because you want more of me.
6027000	6028000	Yeah.
6028000	6029000	That makes sense.
6029000	6030000	No, that's...
6030000	6031000	Scarcity.
6031000	6032000	I'm going to stick with that.
6032000	6034000	Now, you're a busy man.
6035000	6036000	Very hard worker.
6037000	6041000	You guys are all lucky to be getting his time right now.
6041000	6044000	I fight you for it sometimes, I think.
6045000	6046000	That's true.
6046000	6047000	It's not a joke.
6048000	6050000	You guys are delightful, by the way.
6050000	6054000	These guys, they were YouTubers.
6054000	6057000	Consummate good sports, these guys.
6057000	6062000	They haven't been in the TV world yet.
6062000	6065000	So I'm indoctrinating them into like, no, you just got to write a shitty script.
6065000	6069000	It's like terrifying for you guys, but you guys are like fucking churning shit out.
6069000	6072000	You're like, we did what you said, we don't...
6072000	6076000	You guys are doing shit that does not feel good for you to do because I asked you to do it.
6076000	6078000	And you're getting punished for it.
6078000	6079000	That's great.
6079000	6080000	No, no.
6080000	6082000	To be honest, I mean, it's been awesome.
6082000	6091000	I mean, we just got the absolute luck of getting to pitch Dan this idea that you liked enough to take out with us.
6091000	6094000	And we've been learning so much from you, it's been awesome.
6094000	6099000	And I mean, we watched community from the beginning, we watched all your stuff, so to be learning...
6099000	6101000	If he's abusing you, just blink twice.
6106000	6108000	But yeah, no, it's great.
6108000	6110000	It's been awesome.
6110000	6112000	I'm a good person.
6116000	6119000	I have a reputation for not...
6119000	6122000	And I don't know why I'm not in a better mood because tonight,
6122000	6125000	I usually have work tomorrow when I come to the show.
6125000	6127000	I should be in a good mood.
6127000	6129000	I have tomorrow off.
6129000	6133000	Well, from moment one, honestly, you were so gracious to hear our idea,
6133000	6136000	which I think kind of surprised us because we weren't...
6138000	6141000	I urged him not to take that meeting.
6141000	6144000	I said, these guys are YouTubers, it's not worth it.
6144000	6147000	They're never going to amount to anything.
6147000	6149000	I probably never wrote a script in their life.
6149000	6153000	I feel this is where I've known Dan forever, and he shot down my skateboard TV show,
6153000	6156000	where everybody was skateboards. He didn't like it.
6157000	6159000	Well, we took the best parts of that.
6159000	6162000	The thing is, my skateboards had arms.
6165000	6168000	He had it worked out beforehand.
6169000	6175000	The running joke with these guys is I keep pretending that I'm using them to get close to PewDiePie.
6176000	6178000	But I have a...
6178000	6180000	You bring him up an awful lot.
6180000	6182000	You're always wondering how we know.
6183000	6187000	I looked on the calendar. There's a PewDiePie meeting coming up.
6187000	6188000	Oh, shit.
6188000	6190000	PewDiePie's a big fan of Harmondown.
6190000	6192000	We can really elevate his craft.
6194000	6195000	He's coming in.
6195000	6197000	Jeff doesn't know what PewDiePie is.
6197000	6198000	He's just a phenomenon.
6198000	6202000	We're currently working with Dan. We'll move on to you, I guess.
6203000	6206000	Think about if the Beatles was on YouTube.
6207000	6210000	He's like the Beatles of YouTube.
6210000	6211000	He's a video game reviewer.
6211000	6213000	It's a perfect analogy.
6215000	6219000	He's like the biggest fucking force on that entire place.
6221000	6228000	He's the Tim Allen of YouTube in 1998.
6229000	6231000	Yeah, he makes noises.
6231000	6232000	PewDiePie?
6232000	6233000	Yeah.
6233000	6234000	PewDiePie.
6234000	6236000	He's from Foreign Place.
6236000	6238000	Foreign Place, Europe.
6238000	6239000	Yeah.
6239000	6241000	One of them.
6243000	6247000	Yeah, he's going to be at the Balboa Theater.
6247000	6249000	He'll be doing autographs.
6249000	6250000	July 23rd.
6250000	6251000	Take all those photos.
6251000	6252000	He's the day after us.
6252000	6257000	If I told you guys PewDiePie was at my Comic Con show, would you come to the Comic Con show?
6258000	6261000	I really thought the audience would be too generous.
6261000	6263000	They're going to come and it's just going to be me.
6263000	6265000	And you know he's listening because he's a fan.
6265000	6267000	You know who else is a fan?
6267000	6269000	Lin-Wolf Manuel Miranda.
6270000	6273000	And I started Mad Beef with that guy.
6273000	6274000	He hates me.
6274000	6275000	He wants to come on the show.
6275000	6278000	No, he wants to tear me apart.
6278000	6279000	I don't think so.
6279000	6280000	I don't want to see him.
6280000	6283000	I'm afraid of what he'll do to me.
6283000	6285000	And not in a racist way.
6286000	6289000	I may have to have him on the show because he wants to come on the show.
6289000	6290000	No, it would be amazing.
6290000	6293000	But I think he really just wants to take me to task.
6293000	6295000	I guess it'd be worth it, right?
6295000	6297000	It'd be worth it, yeah.
6297000	6299000	What did you do to him?
6299000	6304000	I said some not nice things about Hamilton.
6304000	6305000	Like, I don't get it.
6305000	6307000	It's just rapping.
6307000	6310000	And then someone was like, that's not very nice.
6310000	6313000	I love at Lin-Wolf Manuel Miranda.
6315000	6319000	And then he follows me because he's apparently a huge fan of Harmontown.
6319000	6320000	Yeah.
6320000	6321000	And he sees me tweet.
6321000	6322000	And he gets real mad.
6322000	6323000	I don't know.
6323000	6324000	I don't know what happens there.
6324000	6325000	Well, maybe not real mad.
6325000	6326000	No, he gets so mad.
6326000	6327000	He gets steamed.
6327000	6330000	We should have him do a rap battle with Dan.
6330000	6331000	Oh, no, I know.
6331000	6332000	Yeah.
6333000	6334000	I'm so sorry.
6334000	6338000	Or is he too chicken?
6340000	6343000	To come to the Balboa Theater.
6344000	6347000	That's what we're trying to do on August 4th.
6347000	6350000	Let's look into him, too, for the...
6350000	6351000	That's our takeaway.
6351000	6355000	A big A-list guest for the Balboa.
6355000	6356000	Obviously.
6356000	6357000	Yeah.
6357000	6358000	Obviously.
6358000	6359000	Let's do it.
6359000	6361000	What's Felicia Day doing?
6361000	6363000	She'll be at the Geek and Sundry lounge.
6363000	6365000	We'll be hanging out.
6365000	6368000	Because I can get you Sherry O'Terry.
6374000	6376000	Well, what have we learned tonight?
6378000	6379000	John.
6380000	6382000	What have we learned tonight?
6382000	6383000	Oh, man.
6383000	6385000	A lot about the forensic files.
6386000	6387000	Cubicares.
6387000	6389000	I wonder if there's anything I left off of them.
6389000	6392000	Did we learn everything we didn't know about pubicares?
6392000	6393000	They travel.
6393000	6394000	Yeah.
6394000	6395000	Or migrate.
6397000	6398000	Okay.
6398000	6399000	What about kid murder?
6399000	6401000	They say if you want to get away with a murder,
6401000	6403000	the best way to do it is have a boat.
6403000	6405000	You've got to have your own boat.
6405000	6407000	You can't borrow a boat because they go,
6407000	6409000	oh, did you borrow a boat recently?
6409000	6410000	They go, yeah.
6410000	6411000	If you're onto that now, though.
6411000	6412000	Because now it's like if you...
6412000	6415000	I mean, you can't have a boat that you just teleport to,
6415000	6418000	so the docks just have cameras all over them.
6418000	6420000	So if you get on the boat with somebody you don't like
6420000	6424000	and you come back alone, that holds up in court.
6424000	6425000	Have a boat.
6425000	6430000	Own the security camera-like system.
6430000	6433000	Also, have a carpet business where you're constantly
6433000	6436000	rolling up carpets and putting them on your boat.
6436000	6438000	But you've got to do that for like four or three,
6438000	6440000	three, four years of rolling up carpets and putting them
6440000	6442000	on your boat in underwater carpeting.
6442000	6445000	There's only one thing we didn't talk about tonight.
6445000	6448000	I was talking about selfie sticks and I was asking
6448000	6450000	questions about them and how they worked.
6450000	6452000	And then it came around to, we'll skip a couple steps
6452000	6455000	because it came around to, I started looking it up
6455000	6458000	and I saw that museums were banning selfie sticks in Europe
6459000	6461000	and I was like, yeah, do you really want to be on the side
6461000	6462000	of that snobbery?
6462000	6463000	Aren't American tourists...
6463000	6466000	We're always going to be obnoxious.
6466000	6467000	Who knows?
6467000	6470000	Who do you side with in that Mothra versus Gamera fight?
6470000	6474000	But then Jeff was saying, I wouldn't allow selfie sticks
6474000	6476000	at my museum, but...
6476000	6479000	And I was like, I know one reason why you shouldn't
6479000	6482000	is because you could use them in an elaborate,
6482000	6485000	like crown, what do you call it, affair.
6486000	6488000	Like your selfie stick could easily...
6488000	6489000	Yeah, take it easy.
6490000	6491000	I was testing it.
6491000	6493000	Obviously it's a heist tool.
6493000	6495000	You could disguise a selfie stick, you know,
6495000	6497000	you could use a selfie stick to do a lot of Hudson Hawk,
6497000	6499000	like painting grabbing.
6499000	6500000	Without question.
6500000	6503000	And then Jeff brought up this thing where he said,
6503000	6507000	if I had a museum, I would invite people,
6507000	6510000	I would not allow selfie sticks, but just to make it clear
6510000	6512000	that it wasn't about that, I would say,
6512000	6514000	go ahead, rob my museum.
6515000	6518000	And so then it started me thinking, so here's my pitch.
6518000	6519000	Yeah, I challenged him.
6519000	6521000	I was like, show me what you got.
6521000	6524000	I dare you to try to get away with robbing my museum.
6524000	6526000	So here's my museum pitch.
6526000	6529000	This is how you make a profitable museum.
6529000	6532000	So you know how every museum has a gift shop
6532000	6535000	with key chains and Chinese finger traps
6535000	6538000	and fans and lunch boxes?
6538000	6542000	Like at the Getty, you go there, you get a Chinese finger trap.
6545000	6547000	On the way out.
6547000	6551000	So you take that shit, you put it on display in your museum,
6551000	6556000	you fill the gift shop with incredibly expensive heist items.
6558000	6562000	Oh, welcome to my teddy bear key chain museum.
6562000	6565000	By the way, we encourage you to rob it while you're here.
6565000	6570000	Can we interest you in a $5,000 can of laser spray?
6571000	6574000	The spray you use to reveal where the lasers are.
6579000	6582000	Would you like some night vision goggles for $48,000?
6582000	6584000	Shouldn't the art there be expensive?
6584000	6586000	Or are you saying that you use that laser spray?
6586000	6587000	No, the art there is.
6587000	6589000	People are constantly fucking stealing shit.
6589000	6594000	They're dangling down on wire you sold them for $50,000 a foot,
6594000	6598000	snatching your teddy bear that costs $3 to replace.
6599000	6600000	I'm a genius.
6600000	6602000	Wouldn't they take your expensive heist items
6602000	6605000	and go to a museum that had expensive art?
6605000	6606000	No, they wouldn't.
6606000	6608000	Well, they have to buy them.
6608000	6610000	What this place is, is a...
6610000	6611000	Oh, yeah.
6611000	6612000	He wants to turn a profit.
6612000	6613000	Oh, right.
6613000	6618000	You just have an expensive outlet for heist items.
6618000	6622000	Yes, and by the way, this isn't for real burglars.
6622000	6625000	I mean, they buy their shit wholesale from different people
6625000	6627000	and they rob real museums.
6627000	6631000	This is a way for America or, yeah, well, for the tourists
6631000	6635000	to feel the joy of, I want to be a burglar.
6635000	6640000	And, like, our museum boasts, like, you steal what you want.
6640000	6641000	You know?
6641000	6642000	And then they go, like, oh, shit.
6642000	6644000	And they buy, like, these spandex outfits.
6644000	6647000	And they just, like, they walk out of there broke
6647000	6651000	and then they rob you for, like, a key chain.
6651000	6653000	It's the carnival principle.
6654000	6657000	It seems like a bad business model.
6657000	6660000	All right, I'll keep making...
6660000	6663000	Fucking Thomas the Tank Engine spoofs.
6663000	6667000	I don't know what's going to get me rich faster.
6667000	6669000	All right, well...
6669000	6672000	Make friends with PewDiePie, maybe.
6672000	6674000	PewDiePie?
6674000	6676000	We got to end the show.
6676000	6678000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, all right.
6678000	6680000	What you got, Dan?
6680000	6683000	A song about PewDiePie.
6683000	6684000	Whoo!
6684000	6687000	Whoo!
6688000	6690000	Thank you.
6707000	6709000	Tastes like everyone to High Return, everybody.
6717000	6719000	Day...
6719000	6721000	Day turns into week.
6721000	6723000	Cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat.
6723000	6724000	Put your body in the bucket.
6724000	6725000	Put your body down the chute.
6725000	6727000	Days...
6727000	6728000	Oh, shit, this is the...
6728000	6729000	Okay, the bridge, okay.
6729000	6731000	All right, start it over.
6731000	6733000	All right, okay.
6733000	6735000	All right, wipe your head.
6735000	6737000	Wipe your head.
6739000	6743000	These are the song lyrics to my song.
6743000	6747000	Doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop.
6747000	6751000	When a song has lyrics, they go like this.
6751000	6755000	Chip, chip, chop, chop, choop, choop, choop, choop, choop, choop, choop.
6755000	6759000	Everybody wants a song to be better than it is.
6759000	6763000	But you never know which one you'll get.
6763000	6767000	Everybody needs a song to be good.
6767000	6771000	But you might as well go eat a brick or a piece of wood.
6771000	6775000	Everybody needs music to be good.
6775000	6779000	But if you're listening who's making music good?
6779000	6781000	Take those earbuds out.
6781000	6789000	Grab a microphone, because the people making music are untalented and alone.
6791000	6793000	Thank you for coming to Heart of the Town, everybody.

6835000	6837000	Now you hate people if you hate this song.
6837000	6840000	Check your balls, check your boobies.

6869000	6874000	You're gonna infect your white blood cells until they can't tell them from themselves.
6874000	6876000	They're gonna attack more cells in turn.
6876000	6877000	Turn your whole body in.
6877000	6878000	Make it burn.
6878000	6879000	Help.
6879000	6880000	Instead of life.
6880000	6883000	Then you're gonna die.
6883000	6886000	It's not funny.
6886000	6889000	The show is over like five minutes ago.

6897000	6899000	You're allowed to leave.
6899000	6903000	Don't do a drone strike on Katrina.
6903000	6905000	Hey.
6905000	6911000	I've only stayed here because my ice hat is plugged in.
6911000	6912000	Drone strikes.
6912000	6913000	Katrina hike.
6913000	6915000	Check your ass cancer all night.
