0	14600	Here I am.
14600	37600	All my life, I've been through this dance, I'll treat you right, treat you right, I've
37600	62680	been through this dance, I've been through this dance for a while.
152680	172880	I'm supposed to say something about, uh, uh, Harmon is now in session, or, uh, uh,
172880	192800	I wrote that line this morning, I, I'm so thrilled with it.
192800	196040	So I get Harmon's in session.
196160	197600	Oh, Dan Harmon.
211760	212000	Yes.
226040	241680	Hello, New York. Hello. Thank you. It's good to be back. Thank you. It's somewhat, it was a 90, uh, 90%, uh, uh, uh,
241680	253400	heartfelt 10% awkward standing ovation. I don't know who I dated in this area, but they held out. Uh, you know what?
254360	261720	But I appreciate that. I think a lot of that might've been for, uh, master of entertainment comptroller, Gilbert Gottfried.
271960	281960	This is really a dream come true. I don't, I honestly, I have no connection to Mr. Gottfried. I don't, I've never, I, I, I, I met you 10 minutes ago.
281960	292000	And I, but I, as I, I mean, I'd say Neil, Neil, the director of the documentary has affiliations and somehow your name came up as a possibility for a guest comptroller.
292000	301200	I leapt on it. I, uh, I, I don't know how young they are or what, what they know of, of who's done what. I, I.
301200	308720	So it was basically a choice between me or the guy that played Mr. Belding. Yeah.
312960	320840	I, I, I, I, I, uh, Gilbert Gottfried. Um, I, I, I, I, what the fuck, man?
322360	336240	He, uh, he was, I, I, I, when I was in Milwaukee, I think I was 13 years old, maybe the first time I saw you on TV, uh, did your stand up special and, uh, you're, I, I, I don't know.
337160	345800	No, no, there's nothing funny about kissing people's asses, but I'm just very, I'm very, very, very honored to have you out here and thank you so much for doing this.
345800	355920	I really appreciate it. And there's probably ways you can dig up Gilbert's Comedy Central, not Comedy Central, Cinemax. Remember Cinemax would do comedy experiments?
355920	358080	God, yes, yes.
358080	375680	Uh, uh, uh, Gilbert Gott, Chris Elliott did a comedy experiment for Cinemax that was like totally inspirational to me. Uh, Stuart Penkin did one and you did one that was like a, basically a pilot about you as a news vendor working at a newsstand.
375680	396160	Yeah. Oh shit. That was Norman's Corner. Norman's Corner. And that was written by Larry David. No shit. Yes, yes. I didn't know that. And considering all those names, you'd think it would have been funny.
396160	412720	Well, it was, it was very much so. I don't know. I, I, I loved it a lot. It was one of the, as I said to him backstage, it was one of the eight, eight things that got me off the couch in Milwaukee and out to LA. So thank you so much, Gilbert, for, for coming out here.
412720	439920	Uh, also Gilbert has a, has his own podcast. You just started your podcast. Uh, uh, you, you, you, Gilbert Gottfried's amazing colossal podcast. Yeah. And you can hear it on Gilbert Gottfried.com and subscribe to it on iTunes and sideshownetwork.tv.
439920	467920	Such a, such a sincere actual address, man. And you're on your like 18th episode. You've had Weird Al on, you've had, uh, I think. Adam West, the original Batman. Yeah. Uh, Larry Storch from F Troop. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. I just, see, every now and then I like to get a, a crowd pleaser like Larry Storch on.
467920	494280	See, I like to get the kids in with a Larry Storch and I had Marty Allen. Also, you try to be young in here. It's not like, you know, it's not like there's not things you would do if it was just for your own pleasure, but you do, you whore yourself out for an audience, Larry Storch, you know, let's, let's face it. There's certain sacrifices you have to make for the numbers.
498920	509920	I feel the same way you do, but when I'm talking to these guys, I'll do like a Gremlins 2 reference and they'll, and they'll be like, what, what does that have to do with the transgender community?
509920	536920	Hey, I've had John Glover. He was the evil head of the department store. John Glover. Right, right. And, uh, what was that guy's name? I don't remember. Galligan? Zach Galligan? Zach Galli- Fanakas? No, no, no, no, no. Close enough. And, uh, Phoebe Cades. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.
537920	542920	Remember how Gremlins 2 was a strange comedic departure from Gremlins 1?
543920	554920	Wasn't it weird that Gremlins 2 decided to be a comedy? And, and Phoebe Cades in the first one could, like, shared her backstory. Like, oh, I hate Christmas because my dad died in the chimney.
555920	565920	Oh, and then she does a variation of it. And then it gets ridiculous. She goes, I hate Presidents Day because a man named dressed as Abraham Lincoln exposed himself to me during a white sale.
566920	576920	And it's like, wait a minute. Are you making fun of me for, like, in Gremlins? Because, because I already felt kind of bad about it. You're pushing it, Gremlins 2.
577920	590920	And they would, like, halfway through Gremlins 2, the movie stops and, like, it cuts to a theater and Hulk Hogan stands up and goes, hey, you Gremlins, get out of the production booth. It's fucking insane. You gotta watch Gremlins 2.
591920	596920	That was, like, similar. All of you watched The Tingler.
597920	603920	Everyone here, everyone here seen The Tingler, right? And everyone here pronounces it The Tingler.
606920	615920	Well, that's the Yiddish version. It's The Tingler. Did you see The Tingler?
616920	620920	Do you need a Schmeckle to go see The Tingler down at the Nickelodeon?
621920	624920	I wanna wish each and every one of you a happy Tingler.
627920	629920	But in The Tingler...
633920	639920	The Tingler got loose in the theater. He was a weird rubber creature.
640920	646920	And Vincent Price, and at that point, they shut the lights off. Thank you.
648920	659920	They shut the lights off on screen and the theaters would shut everything off, and Vincent Price's voice would go, scream, scream for your life.
659920	669920	The Tingler. The Tingler is loose in the theater.
672920	684920	Yeah, because the way to make The Tingler, conveniently enough, the way to make The Tingler not attack you is to scream and probably to throw money in the air.
685920	698920	And the idea of telling people, yeah, that they have to scream. I thought you scared us and we screamed, but no, it's not like that.
699920	701920	You have to be instructed to scream.
702920	704920	This is the part where you scream.
708920	712920	And he said scream, scream for your life.
714920	736920	See, much like John Glover, who was in Gremlins 2, both of them, both him and Vincent Price and a lot of them, if someone was a feminine, it was evil.
737920	749920	Sometimes it was eccentric, like Paul Lynn and Charles Nelson Riley, but with Vincent Price, it was, oh, well, you didn't think in terms of gay.
750920	752920	So you thought, oh, he's sinister.
753920	765920	In the 70s, there were rock groups called Queen, and no one thought that means gay.
766920	771920	So it's like, well, I guess the leather and the stuff, I guess they're tough guys.
772920	783920	You know, like Prince and Boy George, but you really had to push mainstream America hard against the wall of capitalism before they'd go, oh, you're gay?
785920	788920	Well, it was like the village people.
789920	790920	Yeah, the village people.
791920	798920	Well, hey, once a construction worker, once a cop, these are macho. They are macho guys.
799920	803920	They're so macho, they're singing about being macho.
804920	808920	They hang out at a place renowned for its masculinity.
809920	815920	Yeah, they're wearing tight leather pants and leather jacket. That's what a real man is.
816920	823920	When they're not in the Navy, they're showering over at the Young Men's Association of Christian Boyhood.
824920	828920	And it was a major news story that Elton John was gay.
832920	835920	We didn't want to deal with it. We didn't want to.
836920	839920	Oh, and George Michael, who would go up in hot pants.
840920	847920	He used to dance in these tight ass-grabbing hot pants, and we'd go, him?
850920	857920	I mean, it's almost adorable how we would go. The lead singer of Judas Priest, remember that? I don't know.
858920	865920	It's kind of adorable, actually. Are the homophobia erupting into just plain sight?
866920	878920	No, I mean, before I will say gay, I will say sinister, I will say heavy metal, I will say new wave, I will say punk, I will say anything but gay.
879920	891920	It's almost like a strange kind of psychic opera where the gay people of America had to actually stamp their feet and scream out loud, louder than Paul Lin.
892920	898920	In Charlotte's Web, you know, it says crunchy.
901920	911920	Louder than Charles Nelson Riley, louder than anything. They had to say, no, I'm sorry, we've been trying to be classy about this.
912920	924920	And on Hollywood Squares, the questions they asked, I mean, they always say, now they say, oh, how Paul Lin twisted it in his mind.
925920	937920	But the questions were always like, where is fairy town located? And it's like, oh, yeah, no, that was a perfectly innocent question.
938920	948920	Yeah, what a weird, twisted... When did... Yeah, I remember it's like, Pete...
951920	957920	On Hollywood Squares, they'd have questions like, so have you ever had a dick in your ass?
960920	964920	And somehow Paul Lin would make it sound gay.
968920	976920	And then we would... But we would still not say. No one would put Paul Lin on the cover of Time Magazine and go, gay is cool.
977920	982920	We would just go, Paul Lin's funny. That funny, crazy guy.
983920	985920	Paul Lin is quite sinister.
986920	990920	He's so sinister. A spider's delight on my...
991920	999920	A tingler is in the theater. Oh, my goodness.
1001920	1010920	What do you really think when you... Is it American culture, is it modern America, or does it pre-date America?
1011920	1016920	Because we had presidents in the early stages of America. What was his name? Buchanan.
1017920	1026920	He was pretty openly gay. Wasn't Buchanan? Buchanan was like... And the only reason why we don't celebrate him more as that is because I don't think he was that great a president.
1027920	1035920	Seriously, because I think that's why gay people don't run down the street and go, Buchanan? Because he kind of like... He wasn't that great.
1036920	1045920	He didn't do much. But the guy was like... I really apologize. I know we have historians and Redditors and stuff if I'm butchering this.
1046920	1059920	I really apologize because I dropped out of college, but as I remember it, I think we had a president, Buchanan, who was basically like, yeah, I don't feel like getting married that much.
1060920	1073920	But I have this fella, and he's just sort of my assistant. And if you remember, in Buchanan's presidential speech, he said, the tingler is loose in the theater.
1074920	1080920	Democracy's loose among the people. Scream! Scream for democracy!
1080920	1102920	But back then, there was a kind of open-faced sandwich of attitude. I usually pay extra to get the open-faced sandwich.
1102920	1118920	When did we become a homophobic culture? When did we start compartmentalizing? When did we go... Because then the other thing that we all know is that ancient Greece and ancient Rome, it was sort of like, hey, whatever. Or was it?
1119920	1134920	What is the history of homosexuality? If only I could ever look this up or inform myself in any way. Why don't I just come out on stage and just ask questions and then walk away?
1135920	1138920	What's the history of gayness? Good night!
1140920	1149920	See, in ancient Rome, they had a bunch of... They had a big structure, and one guy was always the center square.
1149920	1158920	It was Nero. Nero was like... How do you go, look at me, I'm Roman!
1165920	1172920	I kind of want to... I think I temped fate by doing this. Your Vincent Price is really good.
1172920	1186920	One of the things that... That's my crowd pleaser. I used the Vincent Price imitation to get pussy.
1186920	1202920	Do you remember Thriller? You know, Vincent Price did The Bridge? So a lot of the New York people have been asking me on this trip, because they watched the movie, and Gilbert, I know you've been a fan of mine for a while, so...
1203920	1209920	You know what they mean when they say, why was there no rapping in the movie? Because I'm an accomplished rapper.
1216920	1222920	I want to knock out all these birds with one stone and do a rap and have you do the Vincent Price bridge for the rap.
1227920	1233920	If we can pull it off, it could be a very simple... We have to do so little to pull it off.
1234920	1243920	You know the end of the aviator when Leonardo DiCaprio just has to get the spruce goose off the water three inches? If we could just go on, we could just not crash.
1243920	1257920	It might be amazing. Do we have a beat? That's the tough part. We don't have a master music person. I just want to do like a little...
1258920	1271920	Alright, well do we have a master beatboxer in the audience? In New York, someone knows how to beatbox? Alright, who's this emphatic hand waving over here? Yeah, come on up.
1273920	1300920	Oh, another stereotypical beatboxer. What's your name, sir? David. David? Okay, you're a human beatbox? Yeah. You got the Morris the cat shirt? I'll just stand over here or something. I didn't know he was black.
1303920	1329920	Who, Morris? Alright, so, New York, what's on your mind lately? I know 9-11, but... Paul Lind? I can't hear anything. I don't know how to... I heard alliteration, but that's a concept. That's not really... What?
1330920	1347920	I can't hear anything. I don't do improv. I don't do improv. Ebola, Ebola. Alright, Ebola. Ebola, that makes sense. It's topical. Ebola and David Duchovny. Okay.
1347920	1373920	Let's see if we can weave those highway cones. And you know, I don't think it's fun to joke about the fact that David Duchovny has the Ebola virus. I think that's insensitive. That this wonderful man from X-Files is dying of the Ebola virus.
1374920	1399920	You say X-Files like it's his hometown. This wonderful man from X-Files. He didn't mean... From the beautiful town of X-Files. He sits over there in X-Files, Indiana, where he was born and is now dying of the Ebola virus. And you people make a mockery of it.
1400920	1414920	Alright, so I'm gonna try to riff a couple lyrics about Ebola and or David Duchovny. At a certain point, it'll be clear that it's time for Vincent Price to do the... just the spoken word bridge, right?
1415920	1424920	Okay. Okay, alright. Dan, do you want me to lay like some creepy noises like humming down for that? Like cuz in the thriller video in that moment it was like...
1427920	1430920	This guy makes me ashamed to be a Jew.
1436920	1438920	I didn't know you were Jewish.
1445920	1451920	I mean, I think I feel like I feel like if you you mean when he's doing his thing like your beat should probably keep going, right?
1452920	1459920	Well, there are those moments in my life where I go maybe the third Reich was right after all.
1466920	1469920	You're talking to TMZ right now.
1474920	1481920	No, I think when Vincent Price is doing his thing in thriller, the beat is going. I think it's percussive and...
1485920	1489920	And he's like, a horde of ghosts come out at night.
1492920	1494920	Jews are good with their noses.
1495920	1500920	The only one that can fuck this up is me. Okay, alright. Clear your head. Clear your head, Harmon.
1500920	1502920	Can I take this off?
1503920	1504920	Yeah, yeah.
1515920	1523920	Duke Coveney, don't shove me at the airport trying to get all the beloved meat onto the airplane.
1523920	1529920	I got Ebola and I don't know what to say. I'm contagious. You can't contain this.
1529920	1537920	I'm sneezing blood and gonna strain this all over you and it's gonna give you a fatal flu.
1538920	1545920	I'm so sad that David Duke Coveney is dying of the Ebola virus.
1546920	1556920	Why is this wonderful man from the X-Files, Kansas, dying of the Ebola virus?
1557920	1564920	It's almost as if I feel at times in my life that I have a tingler up my ass.
1565920	1568920	All right, all right, all right.
1573920	1574920	What was your name, sir?
1575920	1576920	What?
1576920	1577920	What was your name?
1577920	1578920	David.
1578920	1579920	C-C-Caitle? What?
1579920	1580920	David.
1580920	1581920	David. Caitle, I don't know.
1581920	1582920	My name's up here.
1582920	1584920	I was just creating a Don Bluth movie around here.
1584920	1585920	My name's on the theater up there.
1585920	1588920	Caitle, uh, David, thank you for David.
1588920	1591920	Yeah, and can I get half a pound of pastrami?
1595920	1606920	All right, thank you, David. Thank you. Good beatboxing.
1606920	1608920	That's New York for you.
1612920	1613920	All right.
1613920	1615920	David kissed me.
1615920	1619920	Now I have to do the rest of the show with an erection.
1625920	1628920	Well, let's get more intimately acquainted with the audience, maybe.
1628920	1629920	Oh, okay.
1632920	1634920	Well, actually, you know what we should do before that?
1634920	1637920	We should bring out somebody that we tend to wait too long before we bring out.
1637920	1639920	I'm sure a lot of you people came here to see him.
1639920	1641920	Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden.
1654920	1663920	Holy shit. Can anyone? Holy shit.
1663920	1665920	Am I audible? Holy shit.
1665920	1667920	Okay, now I can hear me.
1667920	1669920	It's kind of actually hard to, uh...
1669920	1673920	Aaron Hillis, everybody. Aaron Hillis.
1676920	1678920	Aaron Hillis.
1678920	1682920	It's actually, this is definitely the classiest joint we've ever done a show.
1682920	1683920	Yeah, yeah.
1683920	1685920	When the curtain came up, was there a curtain?
1685920	1687920	Yeah, a curtain came up.
1687920	1690920	It felt like there was going to be a Cheers reunion.
1692920	1694920	And the audience was like, yay!
1694920	1696920	And then we were like, I don't know what to do.
1696920	1701920	I was like, okay, Gilbert, if you want to go out, and you're like, yeah, absolutely, sure, sorry.
1701920	1703920	Okay, yeah.
1703920	1709920	See, that's the way I plan out my whole career, and it shows.
1709920	1712920	I got to say, man, I'm so glad this is contrived.
1712920	1716920	I'm so glad to be in New York City.
1716920	1719920	See, he knows what he's doing.
1719920	1722920	I'm not just saying that, I'm building to something here.
1722920	1728920	I'm so glad to be in New York City because I can talk shit about Canada now.
1728920	1733920	We were just, you know, Dan knows, we were just in Canada not too long ago,
1733920	1735920	and you can't talk shit about Canada to Canadians.
1735920	1737920	I don't know if you guys know that.
1738920	1742920	But you can't, and so they get bummed out about it.
1742920	1744920	It's sad.
1744920	1746920	They're not even in a funny way.
1746920	1749920	But, you know, like, okay, so we were flying to Canada,
1749920	1751920	and we had to declare customs forms.
1751920	1753920	Have anyone dealt with this?
1753920	1754920	Yeah, no, just me.
1754920	1755920	Okay, yeah.
1755920	1757920	They make you fill out this form.
1757920	1758920	They make you fill it out.
1758920	1760920	They don't tell you beforehand you're going to fill it out.
1760920	1764920	They make you fill it out, but then they don't have any pens on the plane.
1764920	1765920	That is fucked up.
1765920	1766920	Yeah, what the fuck?
1766920	1767920	Yeah, that's fucked up.
1767920	1769920	And then...
1769920	1772920	I definitely agree that that's fucked up.
1772920	1778920	That thing with the pens in Canada and the fact that David Duchovny,
1778920	1784920	a beloved television star, is dying of the Ebola virus.
1784920	1786920	Well, I feel like you're being disingenuous.
1786920	1787920	Yeah.
1787920	1790920	I mean, you're an international traveller, aren't you?
1791920	1801920	See, a lot of times gay people, years ago, were called international travellers.
1801920	1804920	Continentals.
1808920	1811920	We've only done, like, an eighth of the show.
1811920	1817920	We can't just do callbacks for the next seven-eighths of the show.
1818920	1821920	You obviously aren't familiar with me.
1823920	1826920	I could do a series out of it.
1826920	1831920	But this customs thing, like, for real, I'm not kidding.
1831920	1834920	It's the Ebola of the North.
1834920	1835920	See?
1835920	1836920	See?
1836920	1838920	It still worked.
1839920	1844920	They bring the fucking cards and they don't bring a goddamn lump of coal to fill it out with.
1844920	1848920	The guy who gives you forms, you ask him for pens, he's like,
1848920	1851920	yeah, I got pens, but they're loaned out, I'll come back,
1851920	1852920	and then he never comes back.
1852920	1854920	He never see that guy again.
1854920	1857920	And then you land and there's still no pens
1857920	1861920	and you can't get past the border without filling this thing out.
1861920	1863920	Or not the border, you get the idea.
1863920	1866920	But then you can't ask for pens.
1866920	1870920	Dustin, he went to, you know, presumably the lady with pens
1871920	1875920	and asked if he could have a pen, presumably because he saw she had extra pens.
1875920	1878920	And she said, no, I'm sorry.
1878920	1879920	That's it.
1879920	1883920	Upon being pressed, she's like, no, I'm not allowed to give out pens.
1883920	1890920	You're not allowed to give out the pens required for the form you have to fill out to enter the country?
1890920	1894920	But also, everything else aside, why can't you give out pens?
1894920	1895920	What's that going to harm?
1895920	1897920	They cost two cents?
1897920	1901920	It's an entire country. You can't buy 300 pens?
1903920	1905920	I mean, they're not at war with everybody.
1905920	1908920	They have money lying around, right?
1909920	1912920	They're certainly saving money on, like, missiles and stuff.
1912920	1913920	Yeah.
1914920	1916920	And pens are cheaper than missiles.
1917920	1923920	I have a, if I could tell an airline story, then I'm afraid it's going to turn some of our listeners off.
1923920	1925920	I thought that was going to happen to this situation.
1925920	1929920	It's all upper crust problems, but they're engaging problems.
1932920	1934920	Who's that character?
1936920	1938920	They're engaging problems.
1938920	1940920	Sometimes I have warmth.
1940920	1943920	I have an unengaging, alienating, horrible problem.
1943920	1948920	See, that was very sinister, the way he said engaging.
1948920	1949920	Yeah, he was spooky.
1949920	1952920	He's like a master of horror over here, if you know what I mean.
1952920	1953920	He wasn't in...
1957920	1963920	Do you remember, what's the goddamn shit?
1964920	1967920	I Am Legend? Is that the original, the Vincent Price?
1967920	1968920	Oh, yes, yes.
1968920	1972920	It's just driven by voiceover, and the first hour of the movie is just him going,
1974920	1976920	I need more orange juice.
1977920	1980920	And he's like, by the way, there's vampires.
1981920	1986920	And then they do a remake where Vincent Price becomes Will Smith.
1986920	1987920	Yeah, perfect.
1987920	1989920	Because, you know, two are so close.
1990920	1993920	Well, I think they were trying to isolate the problems.
1993920	1995920	They're like, it wasn't the vampires.
1996920	1998920	It wasn't the idea that he was blessed by the earth.
1998920	2001920	I am surrounded by zombies.
2001920	2007920	The first plot point of the original Vincent Price, I Am Legend,
2007920	2013920	is having established that he is the last man on earth in a world where everyone else is vampires,
2013920	2019920	having established that he has adapted by living in a garlic-laden home.
2020920	2022920	He's explaining through voiceover.
2022920	2024920	He's sort of like George Clooney and up in the air,
2024920	2029920	except instead of working as a traveling sales consultant,
2029920	2031920	he knows how to handle vampires.
2031920	2034920	So his voiceover is like, yes, garlic on the door.
2034920	2035920	I'm out of orange juice.
2036920	2045920	And the plot point of that movie, that throws everything into disarray,
2045920	2051920	is that he goes to visit his wife's grave, and he falls asleep.
2053920	2056920	How many times does he do this a week?
2057920	2061920	You fall asleep in your wife's mausoleum?
2061920	2064920	He wakes up and he's like, oh, shit, sundown.
2064920	2066920	Oh, god damn it.
2066920	2068920	Oh, shit, this is going to be hard getting home.
2068920	2070920	What are you doing?
2070920	2071920	She's dead.
2071920	2076920	I mean, I understand nostalgia, but either you could...
2076920	2077920	There's no police.
2077920	2080920	You could move her bones to your house.
2082920	2087920	You can make up new rules about how to treat dead people.
2087920	2091920	You could hang her Santa Claus from your chimney
2091920	2094920	and just be like, every day is Christmas.
2094920	2099920	I love my dead wife and I'm safe because she's made of garlic.
2099920	2105920	But he drives every day to the cemetery in Simi Valley and falls asleep.
2105920	2109920	I was like, oh, shit, god damn it, did I do it again?
2109920	2112920	There's going to be vampires everywhere.
2112920	2115920	And I forgot the orange juice.
2115920	2117920	It's like a bug's life.
2117920	2119920	Like the hero's the fuck up.
2120920	2123920	He's the reason the problem exists?
2123920	2132920	And I remember, too, if I'm not mistaken, his name is Harry in the picture
2132920	2141920	and they've got these zombies, the futuristic vampires going, Harry.
2141920	2147920	And I thought even as a kid, it's not scary having monsters yell Harry.
2148920	2150920	Melvin.
2150920	2153920	Schmoole.
2153920	2155920	Schlyme.
2157920	2159920	Maybe Clint.
2159920	2163920	What would be the scariest name to moan?
2165920	2167920	Lloyd.
2168920	2169920	Lloyd is good.
2169920	2170920	It's not Lloyd.
2170920	2171920	Lloyd is good.
2172920	2175920	When The Shining came out, I was really freaked out
2175920	2179920	because my dad was kind of a Nicholson figure.
2179920	2183920	And I was Danny's age and my name was Danny.
2183920	2190920	And my very Nicholson-like dad was very embodied by Nicholson,
2190920	2194920	who was saying to a woman, Shelly Duvall was very much like my mom.
2194920	2198920	She was kind of like flighty and nervous.
2198920	2201920	And my parents, for some reason, I guess because Kubrick directed it,
2201920	2205920	I was allowed to watch The Shining at 10.
2206920	2210920	Like, yeah, I guess it's either this or tit fraternity,
2211920	2214920	which I was also allowed to watch.
2214920	2219920	But my mom would cover my eyes from behind when there were tits on the screen
2219920	2223920	because there's nothing fucked up about that.
2224920	2229920	Oh, I'm starting to see tits now gently caressing from behind
2231920	2236920	the alabaster hands of the woman who gave me life
2238920	2241920	playing reverse peek-a-boo with me.
2242920	2246920	That certainly didn't mess things up for my marriage.
2247920	2249920	But it's Nicholson, the whole movie, going,
2249920	2254920	Do you want to talk about Danny? Where's Danny?
2254920	2257920	And I was Danny. I was fucked up.
2257920	2262920	And Nicholson was nuts to begin with in that movie.
2262920	2266920	That's what got me. He was crazy at the beginning.
2266920	2270920	And then the big thing is that he goes crazy.
2280920	2283920	Yeah, what if Nicholson goes crazy?
2283920	2285920	Yeah.
2285920	2291920	It's like if Herbie the Love Bug was a Formula One car in the beginning.
2293920	2295920	Totally different story.
2295920	2298920	Pretty effective movie. Did you see that documentary,
2298920	2303920	the Shining documentary, where all the people's theories...
2303920	2307920	Thank you. How many of you have seen the Shining documentary?
2308920	2312920	Why? See, it's too easy in a plus getter.
2312920	2317920	It's like yelling, hey, how many of you are from Brooklyn?
2319920	2324920	And in Brooklyn, you would watch the Shining documentary.
2325920	2326920	Whoo!
2327920	2329920	It's that kind of crowd.
2330920	2334920	The Shining documentary is as popular as Brooklyn.
2335920	2336920	It is.
2337920	2340920	What the hell are we talking about? I don't want to go off on...
2340920	2341920	Airline.
2341920	2345920	Oh, okay. So I took this huge gross shit on the airplane.
2348920	2353920	Can we just talk about the airplane bathrooms and the toilets?
2353920	2355920	That's why I came here.
2356920	2362920	So I think it's amazing that airplane toilets are designed
2362920	2369920	with the apparent presupposition that turds are like cartoon turds.
2370920	2373920	That they're like candy bars that come out of your butt
2373920	2380920	and fall with heavy dry weight down into the bottom of this hopper.
2381920	2385920	That's basically dry and you push a button and a suction pulls it through.
2385920	2388920	There's a little bit of water that's just sort of like, you know,
2388920	2392920	it's like vermouth for a martini.
2393920	2397920	Sometimes you just wave the bottle around the glass.
2397920	2398920	It's symbolic.
2398920	2401920	But by and large, you're dependent on just air.
2401920	2403920	Like, oh, I'm in an airplane.
2403920	2407920	So guess what? Sometimes a red eye from L.A. to New York,
2408920	2412920	I'm not serving up baby Ruth's.
2414920	2416920	You're serving up Indian food.
2416920	2419920	And so you press the button and the thing goes...
2421920	2426920	And then you look down and you go, Jesus Christ, nothing happened.
2427920	2430920	It just evened it out.
2431920	2433920	It just looks like...
2434920	2437920	It just looks like a college prank now.
2438920	2441920	It just looks like I did something on purpose.
2441920	2443920	Like, some woman's going to come in here next
2443920	2446920	because there's no men's and women's rooms on the airplane.
2446920	2448920	That's the other fucked up thing.
2448920	2451920	It's like, Jesus Christ, I'm in a metal tube.
2451920	2453920	I'm already stinking the joint up.
2453920	2459920	Look what I've done today on the red eye.
2460920	2463920	From L.A. to New York, I did something
2463920	2466920	I've never had to do in my life on an airplane
2466920	2468920	because I was in that situation.
2468920	2472920	And I had a choice between walking out and leaving this...
2473920	2474920	Situation.
2474920	2475920	I don't want to...
2475920	2477920	This scene, this...
2483920	2485920	I'm trying to find the...
2486920	2488920	I don't want to...
2488920	2493920	There was just so much that it was like anyone that came in,
2493920	2495920	no matter what they were going to do,
2495920	2500920	they were going to feel like, like, this is business class.
2504920	2506920	And then they were going to come out of the bathroom
2506920	2510920	and look around at the six other people, you know,
2510920	2513920	and land their eyes on me playing Minecraft
2514920	2516920	and I'd be like, meh.
2517920	2519920	So I just...
2519920	2521920	It was beyond embarrassment.
2521920	2522920	It was more like...
2522920	2524920	Honestly, I was empathy.
2524920	2526920	I was like, what would I want to encounter
2526920	2528920	when I came back into a bathroom?
2528920	2530920	When I came into a bathroom, it was to the point
2530920	2531920	where it was kind of like...
2531920	2532920	It was fucked up.
2532920	2535920	It was like a scene in the bowl.
2536920	2538920	And I please appreciate my candor,
2538920	2540920	and I'm sorry if you listen to this podcast
2540920	2542920	with your family while you eat.
2544920	2546920	It's too far gone now.
2546920	2548920	But I just want to confess to you.
2548920	2550920	I just want to explain this to you.
2550920	2552920	For the best possible reasons in the world,
2552920	2555920	I took some dry paper towels from the hand dispenser
2555920	2558920	and I like went down in there.
2559920	2561920	And I was like...
2561920	2564920	I just kind of like shoved and kind of like...
2564920	2567920	I was just like, just something needs to touch this.
2567920	2569920	No water is touching it.
2569920	2572920	So mankind needs to step in.
2573920	2576920	And I just like kind of...
2576920	2580920	And then I created sort of like a...
2580920	2582920	I don't know what...
2582920	2583920	A musket?
2583920	2585920	What the...
2585920	2588920	Like a...
2588920	2590920	You know, like a package.
2590920	2592920	A tingler.
2592920	2593920	Yeah.
2593920	2595920	And then I pressed the flush button again
2595920	2597920	and there's always that pause
2597920	2599920	and you're like, does the button do anything?
2599920	2601920	And I go...
2601920	2603920	And it was like, it still didn't do anything.
2603920	2605920	It just sucked the paper towels through
2605920	2606920	and there was just more...
2606920	2607920	It was just...
2607920	2610920	It still looked like something had happened
2610920	2613920	and I did it again and I did it more
2613920	2616920	and I just kept flushing and I gradually...
2616920	2618920	And I also like...
2618920	2621920	I was washing my hands and I took the soapy water
2621920	2622920	and I was like, okay.
2622920	2624920	And I took a...
2624920	2625920	I was like...
2625920	2629920	And I took it over from the sink and dropped it into the toilet.
2630920	2632920	I was like, this just needs like a dose
2632920	2634920	of what a normal toilet has.
2634920	2635920	This happens every day.
2635920	2637920	Nothing changed about my ass.
2637920	2640920	Like this toilet needs to be like a normal toilet.
2640920	2642920	It just needs water in it.
2642920	2646920	And so like nine flushes and I brush my hand
2646920	2649920	and I do the thing and at a certain point
2649920	2651920	there's always that point in the bathroom.
2651920	2653920	If you're in there too long, the light comes out
2653920	2656920	and it says, please return to your seat.
2656920	2658920	And you always take it personally.
2659920	2661920	You're like, they know.
2661920	2663920	They're talking to me.
2663920	2666920	They're like, you, you return to your seat.
2666920	2668920	And I came out and then the flight attendant
2668920	2672920	like met me face to face as I came out
2672920	2677920	and she looked at me helpfully and said...
2677920	2679920	And I wrote it down.
2683920	2687920	When I got back to my seat, including the apostrophe,
2688920	2691920	she said, you're doing okay?
2695920	2700920	And I must've looked like James Woods.
2702920	2705920	I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2706920	2708920	I was like a weird smuggler character.
2708920	2709920	Yeah, yeah.
2709920	2711920	I mean, I think she was asking
2711920	2714920	why did you have to flush nine times?
2714920	2719920	And I wanted to say, because your toilet isn't made for poop,
2719920	2722920	because I care, because I'm a better toilet
2722920	2724920	than your toilet.
2724920	2726920	It's not because there's anything wrong with me.
2726920	2729920	It's because I know how society works
2729920	2731920	and your plane doesn't.
2731920	2733920	So land it.
2733920	2736920	And let me go do a show.
2739920	2742920	See, I flew back from L.A.
2742920	2746920	and I didn't even take a shit on the plane.
2746920	2750920	I went into the bathroom and the restroom,
2750920	2753920	whatever they call it on a plane,
2753920	2758920	and there was shit filled in the toilet.
2758920	2761920	And I said, I got to get out of here
2761920	2764920	because they're all going to blame me.
2764920	2765920	There's that too.
2765920	2771920	And sure enough, when I walk out like the prettiest girl
2771920	2774920	on the plane walks in there,
2774920	2778920	and I felt like, you know, should I go over to her and say,
2778920	2781920	no, that wasn't me who took a shit.
2781920	2783920	That was someone else.
2783920	2785920	I looked at the shit.
2785920	2786920	Yeah, yeah.
2786920	2787920	I saw it.
2787920	2788920	I'm on the same page as you.
2788920	2790920	Yeah.
2790920	2793920	But I want to know, I was against it.
2793920	2796920	Yeah.
2796920	2801920	Yeah, it's funny how we all have these butts
2801920	2804920	with poop coming out of them all the time,
2804920	2807920	like up to three times a day.
2807920	2810920	And then around that we've built this society
2810920	2814920	in which there's so much room for so much nuance.
2814920	2817920	But there's like an umbilical point,
2817920	2820920	which is our fucking shitty assholes.
2820920	2822920	You can really be reduced to it.
2822920	2825920	Now, how do you feel about those toilets?
2825920	2828920	Like, I remember when I was a kid,
2828920	2831920	you could drop a concrete block in a toilet
2831920	2833920	and it would flush it.
2833920	2835920	And now it does it.
2835920	2836920	It's silent.
2836920	2838920	There are these toilets like poop.
2838920	2839920	It kind of simmers.
2839920	2841920	And yeah, you don't even see the water moving.
2841920	2843920	You don't hear anything.
2843920	2845920	Yeah, because it's good for the environment.
2845920	2846920	Oh, yes.
2846920	2852920	Because that's what's killing the planet is us flushing.
2852920	2856920	It wasn't anything to do with the behavior
2856920	2858920	of giant manufacturers and trans-collaborates.
2862920	2866920	Yeah, it's definitely, isn't that amazing how every time the fuck
2866920	2869920	there's a giant impending disaster,
2869920	2872920	it always just trickles down to us.
2872920	2877920	But we go like, floss twice, floss twice, floss twice,
2877920	2880920	and never use the same string.
2880920	2883920	Or wait, use the same string three times,
2883920	2886920	and then wear that as a hat.
2886920	2892920	If everyone does that, it'll affect the string thing.
2892920	2895920	And we're like, OK, I'm a human being,
2895920	2898920	so I certainly don't want to kill the planet.
2898920	2900920	And then it's like, it had nothing to do with that.
2900920	2904920	It doesn't have anything to do with your fucking garbage.
2905920	2910920	I remember the news was reporting when Ronald Reagan,
2910920	2913920	when he was president and he got shot,
2913920	2916920	and a newscaster actually said,
2916920	2921920	if the president is shot at, how safe are we?
2921920	2938920	Yeah, it's a good opportunity to start getting more guns out there.
2938920	2942920	Oh, Reagan.
2942920	2945920	All right, so Gilbert, we're friends now.
2945920	2948920	Oh, yes, we're inseparable.
2948920	2957920	So you and me, we're going to be partners, you and me.
2957920	2965920	You and me, when other friendships fail, we'll travel.
2965920	2975920	See, I knew all of you came here to see a Martin and Lewis imitation.
2975920	2977920	It's New York, baby.
2977920	2982920	I don't know how to do this, because my big thing is,
2982920	2987920	if somebody solicits something, then it's hard for me to do.
2987920	2996920	Your Seinfeld impression is kind of legendary.
2996920	3003920	Yeah, I started imitating Seinfeld before anyone knew who he was,
3003920	3006920	when he was just another comic in the clubs.
3006920	3010920	And I would go on stage and imitate Seinfeld,
3010920	3015920	and the other comics and the waitresses would be laughing and applauding,
3015920	3020920	and they'd come in, and the one person who wouldn't come in the room
3020920	3023920	when I was doing that was Seinfeld.
3023920	3025920	Who then was named Jerry.
3025920	3027920	Yeah, he was just playing Jerry,
3027920	3033920	and he'd be walking angrily back and forth in the bar going,
3033920	3046920	That doesn't sound anything like me.
3046920	3057920	I don't have a high-pitched, annoying voice.
3057920	3069920	See, sometimes I wonder if Seinfeld has any opinions about patio furniture.
3069920	3073920	Why do people have patio furniture?
3073920	3083920	It's because they need furniture for their patio.
3083920	3086920	You can basically say anything.
3086920	3091920	Why do people put cream in their coffee?
3091920	3104920	Is it because they want coffee with cream?
3104920	3109920	Dan, don't you have a Jerry McSeinfeld?
3109920	3117920	They have a podcast character, Jerry McSeinfeld.
3117920	3123920	I'm usually pretty drunk, and I'm drunk now.
3123920	3127920	I'm assuming that Jerry McSeinfeld sounds like,
3127920	3136920	Oh, why have you ever noticed that clovers have,
3136920	3141920	why do they have to have four leaves?
3141920	3144920	Why can't they have three?
3144920	3148920	But I don't think that we should pick that up right now.
3148920	3160920	I'm known for my Irish, my Irish Vincent Price.
3160920	3165920	The tingler is losing the theater.
3165920	3167920	Oh, be careful now.
3167920	3171920	Oh, the tingler's coming for you.
3171920	3172920	The lights are out.
3172920	3178920	You're going to have to scream and tell your friends about this movie.
3178920	3185920	Scream, scream for your lives.
3185920	3193920	I'm glad that happens.
3193920	3195920	Can I complain about subways for a second?
3195920	3196920	Your subways are amazing.
3196920	3198920	They're so good, everybody.
3198920	3199920	You have great subways.
3199920	3203920	But there's this sense of impending doom you feel on the subway,
3203920	3206920	because underground you don't have your phone, obviously.
3206920	3208920	I mean, you have it, but it doesn't work.
3208920	3210920	And then you could go above ground,
3210920	3213920	so you always actually have your phone service,
3213920	3214920	but you feel trapped.
3214920	3216920	It's probably the iron bars.
3216920	3217920	I'm not going to lie.
3217920	3221920	But what really traps you is the fact that to go outside
3221920	3225920	and then come back in just to check a text message costs $2.
3226920	3229920	And that $2 is slavery.
3229920	3233920	It traps everyone underground and makes them all stressed out
3233920	3236920	because they don't want to pay $2.
3236920	3238920	That's not going anywhere, I don't know.
3238920	3242920	They can't just put cell phone repeaters down there?
3242920	3243920	Well, I don't know.
3243920	3244920	They don't do that, right?
3244920	3247920	Yeah.
3247920	3248920	But you're never trapped.
3248920	3251920	You can always just walk up a stairwell.
3251920	3255920	You just have to pay another $2 to get back under.
3255920	3257920	One of the trains I'm being told...
3257920	3261920	I'm just being informed.
3261920	3263920	One of the trains has cell service.
3263920	3266920	When I was a kid, I think everything's changed now
3266920	3269920	because I know there's that concept
3269920	3271920	of the graffiti-laden subway trains.
3271920	3272920	They're really nice.
3272920	3274920	Yeah, they're kind of nice now,
3274920	3278920	and I remember riding on them in the early aughts.
3279920	3281920	That's the year 2000.
3281920	3283920	Growing up, when you're watching movies,
3283920	3286920	the subways are like these things that rumble
3286920	3288920	and they're like movie sets, you know?
3288920	3291920	These gang members come out and they're like...
3291920	3294920	Attention, people!
3294920	3297920	And everyone reads their newspaper with their umbrellas
3297920	3299920	and goes like, oh, I won't pay attention.
3299920	3301920	And that's the tyranny of the city.
3301920	3306920	And they're like, I am Warlord...
3306920	3309920	Leon Zaxxon...
3309920	3313920	and you are my subsidiaries.
3313920	3316920	And then the whole point of the story is that some guy
3316920	3320920	stands up and goes, goog, I've had it with you.
3323920	3326920	And I don't know how much of that is based on truth.
3326920	3329920	I've written the subway a couple times
3329920	3330920	and none of that happened,
3330920	3333920	but I assume that doesn't happen every time.
3333920	3339920	But I mean, I've seen enough of the last dragon to know...
3339920	3343920	to know that converts are kissed and...
3343920	3345920	All right, anyways.
3345920	3348920	I feel like we should meet people from New York.
3351920	3354920	I don't know if this is indicative of our runtime,
3354920	3355920	but Erin texted me.
3355920	3357920	Erin's sick. She's back in L.A.
3357920	3360920	She texted me a minute ago and said, how did it go?
3361920	3363920	That's 10.33 p.m.
3363920	3365920	And I'm like, well, it went...
3365920	3366920	Erin, that's her name.
3366920	3368920	It's going.
3368920	3370920	Yeah, we should get someone from the balcony, though,
3370920	3372920	if that's okay. At least one person.
3374920	3377920	No one on the bottom floor is applauding that idea.
3377920	3380920	What are we really basing on?
3380920	3383920	I don't know. We've had a couple balcony shows, you know.
3383920	3387920	Gilbert, is there any kind of person you've ever wanted to talk to?
3388920	3392920	I know. So let's skip this whole segment of the show.
3394920	3395920	It's hard to...
3395920	3399920	If someone in the balcony would like to leap...
3406920	3408920	I mean, what's that?
3408920	3409920	I'm in pain.
3409920	3410920	You're in pain.
3410920	3411920	You're in pain.
3415920	3418920	There's that. She's in pain.
3418920	3421920	We've got that as a fallback.
3421920	3422920	She is in pain.
3422920	3425920	I mean, I ask that sometimes. I go, who's in pain?
3425920	3428920	Because it's like the opposite of comedy, and my shtick is irony.
3428920	3431920	And we meet interesting people.
3431920	3434920	But rarely are they actually in pain, I've noticed.
3434920	3438920	Well, sometimes the pain that throbs the hardest with them
3438920	3440920	is the lack of being on stage.
3443920	3445920	Like, a lot of times they're like,
3445920	3450920	Ow! My spotlight bone is killing me.
3450920	3454920	Yeah, one of these days I just want someone who's actually
3454920	3456920	just has a back problem or something.
3456920	3459920	He's loving life. He's having a great time.
3459920	3462920	She's saying she's really in pain.
3463920	3470920	I think God's telling us that we should indulge this young lady down in front of her.
3473920	3475920	I say we roll the dice.
3475920	3478920	Because the alternative is that we kind of like, I don't know,
3478920	3482920	she screams out, I'm in pain, and we ignore her and it's a joke.
3482920	3485920	I don't like what that says about the society.
3485920	3487920	She's got a back problem.
3487920	3489920	What's your name, young lady?
3489920	3491920	Lana. Let's thank Lana for coming up.
3493920	3500920	Let's sit down and let's get to know your pain a little bit.
3501920	3503920	Yeah, it's tough.
3503920	3505920	Have a seat.
3507920	3511920	You're trying to endear them with an apparent stage fright
3511920	3515920	after going, I'm in pain, I want to be up there.
3515920	3517920	I am an actual pain.
3517920	3521920	But you're also not like, holy fuck, there's a bunch of people.
3521920	3524920	No, I am, it's wonderful.
3524920	3526920	Also, hello.
3526920	3528920	Hello, how are you?
3528920	3529920	Hello.
3529920	3531920	Have you met Gilbert Gottfried?
3534920	3537920	Holy motherfucking shit, it's Gilbert Gottfried.
3537920	3540920	I'm here too, hey, hey, hey.
3540920	3543920	Hi, hey, hi, hey.
3543920	3547920	Hi.
3547920	3551920	I'm sorry, holy motherfucking shit.
3551920	3553920	It's not that hard, is it?
3553920	3555920	I mean, come on, he did it.
3555920	3557920	What's going on with your back?
3559920	3563920	My back has this weird thing that's...
3563920	3566920	because I'm an Ashkenazi Jew.
3566920	3570920	So, sorry, I'm in ready, balls.
3571920	3575920	Filming in on the Ashkenazi thing, Gilbert Gottfried.
3575920	3579920	Yeah, see, those are two things, that's another applause-getter.
3579920	3589920	Ashkenazi Jews, how many Ashkenazi Jews in the audience
3589920	3596920	have watched the documentary on the Chinese while living in Brooklyn?
3597920	3601920	I'm from Wisconsin, we have Oshkosh.
3603920	3605920	What's that?
3605920	3609920	What is an Ashkenazi Jew, what does that mean?
3609920	3611920	It means we're from Eastern Europe.
3611920	3614920	These are Jews who watch Ozzy and Harriet.
3616920	3622920	It means you're like Woody Allen Jew, but way cooler.
3623920	3625920	These aren't clear answers.
3627920	3629920	Eastern European Jews.
3629920	3631920	White Jews.
3631920	3633920	Wait, are Jews non-white?
3635920	3638920	So Eastern European, as opposed to...
3638920	3640920	Middle Eastern.
3640920	3643920	Oh, okay, okay, got it, got it.
3643920	3646920	Coccazoid Jews.
3646920	3648920	Okay, I get it, I get it.
3649920	3653920	So your back, you have a bad back?
3653920	3655920	Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
3655920	3659920	But it's cool because every time that I don't have an allergy
3659920	3663920	or a stomach problem, I'm just like, hey.
3663920	3667920	Are Ashkenazi Jews known for not having allergies or stomach problems?
3668920	3670920	I don't know, this is my first time.
3670920	3675920	All right, New York's a big city, I say we keep looking for people.
3676920	3678920	Let's thank Lana, everybody.
3678920	3680920	Thank you, thank you.
3684920	3687920	There's nothing wrong with her, nothing wrong with her.
3687920	3690920	I mean, there's something wrong with her, she has back problems.
3690920	3692920	I mean, there's nothing wrong with her as a human being.
3692920	3694920	I was right, physical pain isn't the way to go here.
3696920	3697920	You asked for it.
3697920	3699920	She did nothing wrong, she's a good person.
3699920	3700920	No, it's my fault.
3700920	3704920	I say we keep going though, let's plumb the depths.
3705920	3709920	I say we get someone with a dread disease,
3709920	3712920	someone who's got three days to live.
3714920	3715920	Yeah, to company.
3715920	3716920	What are you guys calling out?
3716920	3718920	I want to talk about fathers.
3718920	3719920	You want to talk about fathers?
3719920	3720920	Mine's dead.
3720920	3722920	Yours is dead, okay.
3722920	3726920	Let's put a pin in that, put a pin in that, I got a dead father over here.
3728920	3732920	You know what, let's go, why am I, let's go out there.
3732920	3733920	Is this wireless?
3735920	3740920	Because I can't hear you guys that well.
3740920	3743920	Oh, I just realized how loud I am when I'm up there.
3743920	3745920	I keep shouting into the mic.
3745920	3747920	Who was raising their hand over here?
3747920	3749920	Wait, hold on, over, over.
3749920	3751920	What did you have?
3751920	3752920	Such a professional black.
3752920	3754920	He's black, he's half black.
3756920	3759920	Wait, wait, this guy's got a rebuttal.
3759920	3760920	I'm kind of black.
3760920	3762920	He's kind of black.
3762920	3764920	Is that more or less than half black?
3764920	3766920	He doesn't remember.
3768920	3771920	That's, that's severe.
3771920	3775920	Like that's serious, like as hard as it is to be fully black or half black.
3775920	3776920	I'm going to take a wild guess.
3776920	3777920	Yes.
3777920	3784920	I'm going to take a wild guess that there's no 100% black person in this audience.
3786920	3788920	Let's beat, let's beat Gilbert's challenge.
3795920	3798920	You're, I'm sorry.
3798920	3802920	100% black and gay.
3805920	3806920	Come on, come on.
3811920	3812920	New York.
3816920	3817920	We got New York.
3817920	3818920	New York.
3820920	3822920	100% black and gay.
3823920	3824920	In your face.
3829920	3833920	Are you, are you in any pain aside from the obvious?
3833920	3838920	Just a, no physical pain, just deep spiritual pain.
3838920	3839920	Deep spiritual pain.
3839920	3842920	Now you're 100% black.
3842920	3845920	You're not a security guard here, are you?
3845920	3847920	Oddly enough, no, it's weird.
3847920	3849920	I tried it and it turned me down.
3849920	3851920	He's a, he's a fan of mine, Gilbert.
3851920	3853920	Eat it, eat it.
3854920	3857920	I have a 100% black gay fan.
3860920	3861920	Right here.
3862920	3866920	But what do we, 100% black, how do we even know?
3866920	3871920	I mean, we're doing like basic rounding up probably, but it's on fire as I know.
3871920	3874920	Well, rounding up is how though, I mean, that's a terrible.
3874920	3876920	I'm sure it's, I'm sure it's a drop.
3876920	3879920	I'm sure I've got drops of something somewhere, but as far as I know, it's 100% black.
3879920	3882920	I'm sure Thomas Jefferson somewhere in there was like.
3882920	3886920	Hey, he was like, you're a great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great.
3886920	3887920	Grandma, that's real good.
3888920	3893920	Yeah, I think we all are kind of like a little less pure than anyone would.
3894920	3896920	I don't think anyone would want to be right.
3897920	3899920	White people want to be a quarter Cherokee.
3900920	3903920	Anyways, but 100% black as far as you can tell.
3903920	3904920	Yeah.
3904920	3906920	You've traced it back.
3906920	3907920	Yeah.
3907920	3908920	Where does the gayness come in?
3910920	3911920	Do you?
3911920	3914920	I think we all know where the gayness comes in.
3918920	3919920	Gilbert.
3919920	3923920	I would rather not picture it in my head right now.
3924920	3925920	No, come on.
3925920	3927920	It's 2014.
3927920	3929920	We all want to picture it in our heads.
3932920	3939920	I'm kind of curious about, like, are you New York raised in the reared?
3939920	3940920	No.
3943920	3945920	Are you a New York native?
3945920	3946920	I'm not a New York native.
3946920	3947920	I'm a DC native.
3947920	3948920	DC?
3950920	3952920	Wasn't that the murder capital of the world?
3952920	3953920	No, no, no.
3953920	3956920	AIDS infestation, infestation, infestation?
3956920	3958920	AIDS capital?
3958920	3959920	AIDS capital world, yes.
3959920	3962920	Murder capital world is like Jersey, I think, or Baltimore.
3964920	3965920	Camden.
3968920	3969920	Did not Jersey then.
3969920	3971920	But somewhere else, but not DC.
3971920	3980920	Is it true that when gay guys have anal sex, they scream out the tinglers loose in the...
3981920	3982920	The tingler.
3982920	3984920	The tingler is loose in the...
3984920	3986920	I'm wondering how you know all this.
3988920	3989920	How do you...
3989920	3993920	Okay, let's ask some standard gay questions.
3993920	3995920	If you'll indulge them.
3995920	3996920	Go.
3996920	3999920	And you're not an ambassador of gayness.
3999920	4000920	No.
4000920	4002920	So I want to get subjective.
4002920	4006920	This is a question I always am curious about.
4007920	4010920	Is there a moment in your life when you knew...
4010920	4013920	Did you think, like, uh-oh, there's a division.
4013920	4016920	Like, I think differently, I feel differently,
4016920	4019920	and I think it's more than just me being an individual.
4019920	4023920	I think I'm on the other side of a line that's being drawn somehow.
4023920	4026920	Was there a crucial moment in your life?
4026920	4030920	No, I never had that, like, oh, wow, I'm a gay moment.
4030920	4033920	I just sort of had, like, oh, you like dudes, you like chicks.
4033920	4035920	I like dudes too, but you don't kind of thing.
4035920	4038920	It's really easy back when I was growing up.
4038920	4040920	Is it just really easy in D.C.?
4040920	4041920	It's easy...
4041920	4044920	Actually, no, it's not, I don't know how I got that.
4044920	4045920	Maybe it's easy for you, maybe.
4045920	4046920	It's easy for me, that's all I can say.
4046920	4047920	Maybe it's a new generation.
4047920	4049920	Yeah, for me, I had it easy, but yeah,
4049920	4051920	I never had, like, a against each other moment,
4051920	4054920	or, like, a here is the division line I sort of always knew.
4054920	4056920	I think that might be a Gen X thing.
4056920	4059920	Like, every gay character in every movie has to have a monologue,
4059920	4062920	where they're like, and then Toby got out of the swimming pool.
4063920	4066920	And he said, do you want to have a sleepover?
4066920	4068920	And I was like, yeah.
4068920	4070920	And he's like, because we both like girls, right?
4070920	4071920	And I said, yeah.
4071920	4073920	And I was lying.
4076920	4081920	But maybe you're part of a new generation of star children
4081920	4084920	that was, like, saw those movies and you're like,
4084920	4086920	I'm gay.
4088920	4090920	I'm not going to make the mistake that guy made.
4091920	4092920	I don't know.
4092920	4094920	I mean, there's never been some price moments where I want it.
4096920	4098920	Spider's the light.
4099920	4102920	Your birthday cake covered in demons.
4103920	4106920	My name is Harry.
4107920	4110920	All the vampires call me Harry.
4114920	4118920	Okay, now let's talk about something really, really sensitive,
4118920	4122920	but probably not in New York, because New York is the most advanced,
4122920	4125920	progressive, incredible city on the planet.
4127920	4131920	But everywhere else, like, inquiring minds want to know,
4131920	4134920	where does the black and the gay intersect?
4134920	4137920	Like, what is the conflict on that Gaza Strip?
4137920	4142920	Because white, straight, fat Jim Belushi's like me.
4143920	4146920	We worship gay people and black people.
4146920	4148920	And if you want to know the God's honest truth,
4148920	4150920	then I can confess this to you and no one else.
4151920	4154920	At a certain point, we're like, black people are yesterday's news.
4154920	4156920	They can take care of themselves now.
4156920	4158920	Gay people are the new black.
4161920	4163920	But in any case, I'm sorry to break that to you.
4163920	4170920	But also, there's like this unspoken thing,
4170920	4175920	it's like to the extent that you can circumscribe black culture,
4175920	4179920	and there shouldn't, I mean, black culture shouldn't have,
4179920	4183920	there's a homophobia that's allowed, right?
4183920	4185920	Like, right?
4187920	4189920	I mean, yes?
4189920	4191920	Yes, is the answer to your question.
4191920	4194920	Like, it's not as called out, because what are we supposed to do?
4194920	4196920	We're going to kick down every door and go like,
4196920	4199920	everybody except gay people, and then we're like,
4199920	4204920	well, black people, we'll put a pin in it.
4204920	4206920	We're already trying to...
4206920	4208920	We'll come back to you.
4208920	4211920	We don't want to be hypocrites and come into your living room
4211920	4214920	and go like, you black people are not tolerant enough.
4216920	4219920	It's too meta for us.
4220920	4223920	Okay, you could be homophobic for a little while longer.
4223920	4225920	We'll figure that out when the time comes.
4225920	4227920	We'll get a pass and deal with you later.
4227920	4231920	And I guess, you know, it's like suburban white kids in the 90s,
4231920	4233920	like, listening to gangster rap.
4233920	4235920	It's like there's heavy overtones of, you know,
4235920	4237920	if you were gay listening to that stuff,
4237920	4240920	and you were black, I would think that you would be,
4240920	4242920	you would be like, shit.
4242920	4244920	It's shit.
4244920	4246920	Oh, fuck.
4246920	4248920	It's a little bit like that. It's like, well, fuck,
4248920	4251920	what am I listening to now? But at the same time...
4251920	4252920	Garth Brooks.
4252920	4255920	Garth Brooks is really good sometimes, I hear.
4255920	4257920	Yeah.
4257920	4258920	He's not going to help you.
4258920	4260920	I could try that, I guess.
4260920	4261920	No, it's weird.
4261920	4263920	It's just weird like comedy, because you have these two
4263920	4265920	minorities, and they both have their own, like,
4265920	4267920	sort of, psychologies about them.
4267920	4269920	Like, you know, you're black, you're this.
4269920	4270920	You're gay, you're this.
4270920	4272920	You know, it's not really intersecting a lot
4272920	4274920	for people's mentalities, but I mean,
4274920	4276920	you sort of work it out. You figure it out.
4276920	4278920	Everybody works everything out.
4278920	4282920	I feel like, like, why is every cultural movement
4282920	4285920	in our country, like, why do I get the feeling that
4285920	4288920	the unspoken foundation of it is the idea that
4288920	4290920	white people are going to end everything,
4290920	4291920	like, including racism?
4291920	4294920	Like, if racism is a problem that can be solved,
4294920	4296920	white people will take care of it.
4296920	4298920	I think you're missing points more, like,
4298920	4300920	white people are going to end in, like, 40 years.
4300920	4302920	Well, yeah, I think that's what we're working against.
4302920	4304920	I think white people are like, like,
4304920	4306920	well, what do we do about racism?
4306920	4308920	Let's have a meeting about racism.
4308920	4310920	I think, yeah, exactly.
4310920	4312920	We'll just make more of us into, like,
4312920	4315920	I'll populate you, populate you, sort of.
4315920	4317920	Okay, so, all right.
4317920	4323920	So, when you have a friend and they're black...
4323920	4325920	Do you mean friend or do you mean friend?
4325920	4329920	Not, like, in a gay way. Is that what you mean?
4329920	4331920	Yeah.
4331920	4335920	Like, I feel like my six black friends.
4335920	4337920	Six?
4337920	4340920	Well, one of them's probably going, like, me?
4340920	4342920	Wait.
4343920	4346920	Jerry Miner's listening right now and going,
4346920	4348920	don't you dare.
4348920	4350920	Is the Nicole Brown back there saying no?
4350920	4352920	Yeah, the vet's like, wait.
4352920	4355920	As a black man, when you see black people coming at you,
4355920	4357920	do you get scared?
4357920	4361920	Oh, man, I mean, dad crossed the street so fast now.
4361920	4363920	No, actually, you know what, I'll answer that question.
4363920	4367920	That's a good question. I do.
4367920	4369920	No, but it's like, people get scared of people.
4369920	4372920	If somebody's wife gets scared, I'll go across the street.
4372920	4374920	If I'm a black person coming towards me,
4374920	4377920	God, stay on the same side of the street, though.
4377920	4379920	You can't leave.
4379920	4381920	You see people who aren't you. You don't know them.
4381920	4382920	I don't know who you are.
4382920	4384920	Well, I cross the street when I see strangers coming.
4384920	4386920	Yeah, exactly. But, like, if it's a black stranger,
4386920	4387920	I got to stay on the side.
4387920	4389920	Like, oh, it's any other stranger, I got to cross the street.
4389920	4391920	Black stranger, damn it. Can't do it.
4391920	4393920	Yeah, it's that whole thing.
4393920	4395920	I have to, yeah.
4395920	4397920	If you're going to stay on the same side,
4397920	4399920	you're going to get a fist bump at your ball class.
4399920	4401920	I'm always wondering, like, the elephant in the room
4401920	4406920	with race in the 21st century is now that we've accomplished
4406920	4408920	the fact that we go, like, you know what,
4408920	4411920	this is an artificial construct. It absolutely is, physically.
4411920	4416920	Because two random white people, like,
4416920	4419920	would be physically as different from each other
4419920	4423920	as, like, a black person from a white person.
4423920	4426920	In a technical kind of, like, sense,
4426920	4428920	it is an artificial construct that's being perpetuated.
4428920	4431920	Like, the idea that there is such a thing as race.
4431920	4432920	And I get that.
4432920	4434920	But at the same time, like, we are, like,
4434920	4436920	we have all this momentum, so it's like,
4436920	4438920	when a black person walks in the room,
4438920	4442920	like, I don't, like, my 41-year-old white brain
4442920	4446920	never goes, never, never, it never is unaware of race.
4446920	4449920	Like, I go, a black guy can just walk to the room.
4449920	4450920	Now, I can, I can...
4450920	4451920	Well, if that's true, then why didn't you bring me
4451920	4453920	up to the stage when I came in first?
4453920	4456920	Well, I didn't, I mean, I, listen.
4456920	4457920	You can come by anytime.
4457920	4458920	Can I ask a question?
4458920	4462920	When you're happy or excited, do you ever yell,
4462920	4466920	DINOMY!
4466920	4469920	For those of you, for those of you listening
4469920	4475920	and not seeing, our guest bears a resemblance.
4475920	4484920	It's possible if you're just listening,
4484920	4487920	I could have sounded incredibly racist.
4487920	4490920	But the truth is, there is a resemblance.
4490920	4493920	But that doesn't mean I'm not incredibly racist.
4493920	4495920	No, no, no, that's still an option.
4495920	4497920	It can be both.
4497920	4506920	What I always want to know,
4506920	4508920	and I only want to know just recreationally now,
4508920	4510920	because I'm 41 and I'm just like, I'm dying.
4510920	4513920	I'm just like, wow, that's, I can't change my brain.
4513920	4517920	But I'm always curious, like, because I think 85%
4517920	4520920	of everybody's always full of shit.
4520920	4525920	And like 85% of people in a certain age were like,
4525920	4528920	oh, race matters a lot.
4528920	4530920	And so we should be really mean to people
4530920	4533920	that look like this instead of like that.
4533920	4536920	And then we entered a new era where we're like,
4536920	4539920	okay, because of the work of heroes and brave people
4539920	4541920	that risked shit and did difficult things,
4541920	4543920	then we entered an era where we're like,
4543920	4545920	okay, race is not supposed to matter.
4545920	4548920	But we also just entered an era where 85% of people,
4548920	4550920	i.e. idiots, just started going,
4550920	4553920	I'm going to start enforcing that like a fucking idiot.
4553920	4556920	Like you're still talking to a bunch of dumb people
4556920	4559920	who are like now lynching racists instead of,
4559920	4562920	they're just writing letters to TV Guide and going,
4562920	4564920	I couldn't help but notice.
4564920	4566920	I'm irresponsible thing.
4566920	4568920	Like you're still an idiot.
4568920	4571920	Like you're, we just went from a different,
4571920	4573920	from one form of coward to another form of coward.
4573920	4578920	And I always wonder like when you cancel all that out
4578920	4581920	and just go, everything cowardly is cowardly
4581920	4583920	and everything brave is everything brave.
4583920	4586920	In the grand scheme of things,
4586920	4591920	like what is the actual definition of not racist?
4591920	4595920	Is it actual, because the modern definition is-
4595920	4596920	Porn stars.
4596920	4597920	What's that?
4597920	4598920	Porn stars.
4598920	4599920	Porn stars.
4599920	4602920	The pornography industry has like achieved it, right?
4602920	4604920	Is that what you mean?
4604920	4606920	Because it's like, we don't,
4606920	4609920	they have every license to be grody.
4609920	4611920	Like, but it's just sort of like-
4611920	4614920	This is absolutely true.
4614920	4617920	Because you know, I love porn titles
4617920	4621920	where they twist around to real movie titles
4621920	4625920	like Ram Bone and everything like that.
4625920	4626920	I know you love that.
4626920	4632920	I saw one, a porn film that was a black guy and a white girl
4632920	4636920	and it was called Amos and Candy.
4640920	4643920	That's 100% true.
4643920	4645920	That's 100% true that you want that?
4645920	4646920	Yeah.
4646920	4648920	It was the brightest title.
4648920	4649920	Check it out.
4649920	4654920	It would make me feel a little bad watching it.
4654920	4658920	Just out of alliteration.
4658920	4662920	I just always wonder like, is consciousness of racism
4662920	4666920	or is like, because now that that's become
4666920	4668920	the new definition of racism,
4668920	4672920	now it's like you could go into a room full of people
4672920	4675920	and the first person that acknowledges race,
4675920	4677920	that's a weakness.
4677920	4678920	That's a human weakness.
4678920	4683920	And it's the actual, it's the less brave,
4683920	4686920	it's the easier thing to do to like,
4686920	4689920	it's the more socially acceptable thing to point out-
4689920	4691920	Racism is whoever smelt it, dealt it.
4691920	4693920	Whoever smelt it, dealt it.
4693920	4696920	Yeah, that's the new rule of racism.
4697920	4701920	It is true that someone that would be cognizant of race
4701920	4702920	and might reflect that.
4702920	4705920	That might be a symptom of latent racism,
4705920	4707920	but at the same time, I always wonder like,
4707920	4710920	oh, now that we're rooting that out, what's left?
4710920	4713920	Aren't we actually just creating some weird garden
4713920	4715920	where we-
4715920	4716920	You're always obsessed with race.
4716920	4718920	I have so many friends who come to me,
4718920	4721920	hey, man, no offense, but ask, you're black, right?
4722920	4725920	Yeah, ask the black man, just ask a question.
4725920	4727920	You have a question, just ask it.
4727920	4729920	Ask curious about that.
4729920	4732920	I think people are also pretty obsessed with race
4732920	4733920	as the first thing.
4733920	4735920	Like, oh, I have this question about race.
4735920	4736920	I'm just not going to address it at all.
4736920	4738920	I'm just going to dance around the kind of thing.
4738920	4739920	Like, oh, there's a black guy.
4739920	4740920	Okay, whatever.
4740920	4742920	But if your friend was a redhead,
4742920	4744920	and if they were a blonde or a brunette-
4744920	4745920	My friend is a redhead.
4745920	4747920	That's pretty hot.
4748920	4753920	There's the same emphasis on consciousness of it,
4753920	4755920	and I think that's the goal, right?
4755920	4757920	You go like, my friend's tall, my friend's a redhead,
4757920	4760920	my friend has freckles, my friend has blonde,
4760920	4762920	and there's blonde jokes, and there's redhead stereotypes,
4762920	4763920	and there's all this stuff.
4763920	4766920	And these are phenotypical characteristics
4766920	4767920	that you're supposed to be-
4767920	4770920	You can be conscious of, and you can be entertained by,
4770920	4774920	you can be amused by, but the big difference is race.
4774920	4777920	Which is an artificial construct, has this wall,
4777920	4778920	where it's representative.
4778920	4780920	It's like as if you took redheads
4780920	4783920	and you said some weird shit about them,
4783920	4785920	and then there was like this crazy wall,
4785920	4787920	and everyone was like walking on eggshells,
4787920	4789920	and there was all this weird energy about it.
4789920	4794920	I've never had friends who are scared to just sort of say,
4794920	4796920	for lack of a better term, just racist shit.
4796920	4797920	Like, they make jokes about race,
4797920	4799920	but make jokes about like, you know, black guy joke,
4799920	4801920	white guy joke, whatever kind of joke.
4801920	4802920	And just sort of like, you know,
4802920	4803920	you're one of the people now who are in your comedy,
4803920	4804920	you're dressed to race.
4804920	4806920	Like, oh, it's a factor of our life, it's going to be a joke,
4806920	4807920	but I mean, it doesn't have to be like,
4807920	4808920	you don't have to dance around it, kind of thing.
4808920	4809920	It'll be on eggshells.
4809920	4811920	And so I think there are people who know like,
4811920	4813920	oh, there's race, okay, whatever.
4813920	4816920	And there's race, oh, there's race, kind of thing.
4816920	4818920	So like, for me, it's just always been like,
4818920	4820920	people I know are just like, oh, yeah, we're black,
4820920	4821920	we're going to keep on moving.
4821920	4823920	Is there another question?
4823920	4824920	Let's go on.
4824920	4825920	Yeah.
4825920	4826920	Yeah.
4826920	4827920	Yeah.
4827920	4828920	Yeah.
4828920	4829920	Yeah.
4829920	4830920	Yeah.
4830920	4831920	Yeah.
4831920	4832920	That's cool.
4832920	4833920	Yeah.
4833920	4834920	Yeah.
4834920	4835920	I can't figure it out.
4835920	4841920	I'm just so glad you came up here and made me feel like a better person,
4841920	4843920	which is the new racism.
4843920	4846920	You're welcome.
4846920	4848920	What was your name again?
4848920	4849920	I forgot.
4849920	4850920	Just Siri.
4850920	4851920	What's that?
4851920	4852920	Just Siri.
4852920	4853920	Just Siri.
4853920	4855920	I obviously never asked that because that's a weird name.
4855920	4856920	Just Siri.
4856920	4857920	Right.
4857920	4858920	You're like a Game of Thrones character.
4858920	4859920	I could be.
4859920	4861920	I very well could be from some rounds.
4861920	4863920	Will you stay up here and play Dungeons and Dragons with us?
4863920	4867920	I'm going to sign yes.
4867920	4868920	I've never played.
4868920	4870920	Well, yeah, it's okay.
4870920	4874920	Either it's Gilbert Gottfried and he's going to be like crucial to the...
4874920	4877920	I think it's very important for me to mention,
4877920	4880920	he's wearing a Batman t-shirt,
4880920	4886920	and on my podcast, Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast,
4886920	4889920	we interviewed Adam West.
4889920	4890920	Yeah, yeah.
4890920	4893920	See, it came in in conversation.
4893920	4896920	People should listen to Gilbert Gottfried's podcast.
4896920	4898920	There's no question about that.
4898920	4901920	You can hear it on GilbertGottfried.com
4901920	4907920	and subscribe to it on iTunes or SciShowNetwork.tv.
4907920	4912920	Now, as a favor, can you go right to the mic and go,
4912920	4915920	hey, hey, hey?
4915920	4917920	I think we were asking for us.
4917920	4919920	Hey, hey, hey.
4919920	4921920	What were you asking for?
4921920	4924920	Well, that's rerun, isn't it?
4924920	4925920	Yeah.
4925920	4927920	Can you go, what you talking about?
4927920	4928920	Wait, now, okay.
4928920	4930920	This is racism.
4930920	4932920	Because the only thing...
4932920	4935920	He looks a little bit like Jimmy Walker,
4935920	4938920	so the dynamite thing was not racist.
4938920	4941920	Hey, hey, hey, and what you're talking about is racist.
4942920	4945920	Because you're saying, do things that other black people do.
4945920	4948920	How are they living colors, Shanae?
4948920	4949920	Shanae?
4949920	4951920	Oh, all right.
4951920	4952920	Thanks, front row guy.
4952920	4953920	No, no, no.
4953920	4955920	What was rerun's catchphrase?
4955920	4957920	What was rerun's catchphrase?
4957920	4959920	He didn't just say what's happening.
4959920	4960920	That was the title of the show.
4960920	4962920	He used to dance, rerun.
4962920	4963920	He had that...
4963920	4965920	Somebody said, hey, hey, hey.
4965920	4966920	It wasn't Shanae.
4966920	4967920	No, he was the guy...
4967920	4968920	You're not Fat Albert.
4968920	4969920	No, that...
4969920	4970920	No, yes, I know.
4970920	4972920	Fat Albert said, hey, hey, hey.
4972920	4973920	The guy who was...
4973920	4975920	Someone else said, hey, hey, hey.
4975920	4976920	His name...
4979920	4981920	His name was Dwayne.
4981920	4985920	I think Dwayne used to go, hey, hey, hey.
4985920	4987920	Yeah, no.
4987920	4990920	And Fat Albert was...
4990920	4992920	Yeah.
4992920	4995920	See, it was a subtle difference.
4995920	4998920	Yeah.
4998920	5003920	I think we've learned a lot about African Americans today.
5003920	5004920	All right, we're gonna...
5004920	5009920	And I want you all to remember that Dwayne said, hi, hi, hi.
5009920	5013920	And Fat Albert was, hey, hey, hey.
5013920	5014920	We're gonna find...
5014920	5015920	We're gonna find...
5015920	5021920	We're gonna find a female or at least somewhat feminine friend.
5021920	5024920	I'm sorry, balcony.
5024920	5026920	We have someone who called out, I'm also gay.
5026920	5027920	I tried.
5027920	5030920	And offered we could have an all gay stage.
5030920	5032920	Those words don't make sense.
5032920	5036920	And now we have people yelling out, bye, bye.
5036920	5037920	Wait, what?
5037920	5039920	Oh, blind?
5039920	5040920	Oh, fuck this.
5040920	5041920	Yeah.
5045920	5046920	Holy shit.
5050920	5051920	This is insane.
5051920	5052920	I actually...
5052920	5054920	I completely forgot this.
5054920	5055920	I was going to...
5055920	5057920	I was thinking about this.
5057920	5058920	What's your name, sir?
5058920	5059920	Rory.
5059920	5061920	Rory, are you totally blind?
5061920	5062920	Yeah.
5062920	5064920	Can't see anything.
5065920	5067920	I'm sorry I'm defining it for you.
5068920	5070920	Well, like, some people go, like, well, I'm...
5073920	5075920	How do we get you up there?
5075920	5076920	I don't...
5076920	5077920	Okay, all right.
5077920	5078920	Walk.
5078920	5079920	Okay, Rory.
5079920	5081920	Are these sisters going to bring them up?
5086920	5087920	I thought...
5091920	5094920	I'm sorry, gay lady, but if you're upset,
5094920	5096920	then you're a terrible person.
5099920	5100920	Okay.
5100920	5103920	I'm assuming Rory's sister has been through worse than this.
5103920	5104920	Like, she's...
5104920	5107920	This is some precarious shit even for the sighted.
5107920	5108920	Are we cool?
5108920	5110920	Can I take over from here?
5110920	5111920	Okay.
5111920	5114920	This is, like, unreal that this is happening right now.
5114920	5115920	Okay.
5116920	5118920	Wait, wait, wait. Sorry, sorry.
5118920	5119920	Hold on. Stay still for a second.
5119920	5121920	I want to move some stuff for you.
5121920	5122920	Holy fuck.
5122920	5123920	I cannot actually believe this.
5123920	5124920	Wait.
5124920	5126920	I'm going to sit you in the chair that I was sitting in.
5126920	5127920	Oh, boy.
5127920	5128920	I'm really flustered.
5128920	5129920	Like, I...
5129920	5132920	Because I feel very nervous that I'm...
5132920	5134920	I'm going to put this mic in this stand
5134920	5136920	and I'm going to sit you in this chair.
5137920	5138920	Okay.
5138920	5141920	So, the chair is right here.
5141920	5144920	I'm sorry if I'm being politically incorrect by, like, like...
5146920	5148920	I always say fuck political correctness.
5148920	5149920	I'm against it.
5154920	5155920	I thought you were going to say,
5155920	5157920	I always say fuck political correctness.
5157920	5158920	I can't fucking see.
5160920	5161920	Who is this fucking guy?
5161920	5163920	Aaron Hillis, everybody.
5163920	5164920	Aaron Hillis.
5165920	5166920	He loves ice.
5166920	5168920	He loves ice.
5168920	5170920	Are you a drinker?
5170920	5171920	Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
5171920	5173920	Okay. Let's help this guy out.
5173920	5174920	Oh, my yes.
5175920	5177920	Can we get a cup from back there?
5177920	5178920	Because there's only...
5178920	5183920	If I have a story I can share that I thought was actually very relevant
5183920	5186920	to the conversation, not, you know,
5186920	5190920	not to say that, like, the black culture is necessarily, like, homophobic,
5190920	5193920	but, like, the idea of certain black people who want equal rights
5193920	5196920	but are still homophobic, I just had to...
5196920	5201920	I had an experience that was very, like, exemplified that.
5201920	5202920	Mm-hmm.
5202920	5206920	Because I sort of have this problem where whenever I'm drunk in public,
5206920	5209920	I forget that it's not okay to make racist jokes.
5210920	5211920	So...
5211920	5213920	So, like, it was...
5213920	5214920	They call that racist.
5215920	5216920	So...
5216920	5217920	All right, so I was...
5217920	5220920	I know you can't see, but I want you to know you're killing right now.
5224920	5225920	Um...
5225920	5227920	And also here is a drink...
5229920	5230920	There you go.
5230920	5231920	Great.
5234920	5239920	I feel terrible about this, but you realize there's not a podcast
5239920	5241920	going on right now.
5242920	5245920	Just a really good surround sound laugh track.
5245920	5246920	Yeah.
5246920	5247920	Um...
5247920	5248920	Now, can I ask you a question?
5248920	5249920	Yeah, yeah.
5250920	5252920	If God came down and said,
5252920	5257920	we can give you perfect sight, but you'd have to be black...
5259920	5261920	That's a toughie.
5267920	5268920	That...
5268920	5270920	That's comptroller.
5271920	5272920	Um...
5272920	5277920	Well, it just hit me that Gilbert Godfrey just said something to me.
5278920	5279920	Holy fuck.
5279920	5280920	This is not real.
5280920	5281920	Okay.
5281920	5282920	What was the story?
5282920	5283920	What was the story?
5283920	5284920	So, yeah.
5284920	5287920	Like I said, like, I get drunk and forget that I can't just shout,
5287920	5288920	like, racist jokes.
5288920	5291920	So, anyway, there's just, like, I was just standing outside,
5291920	5294920	and, like, there's just a bunch of people standing around in my college,
5294920	5297920	and, like, one kid said something about, like, being white.
5297920	5300920	Like, he was just like, oh, he said something about how white he was,
5300920	5302920	so naturally I was just like, oh, white power.
5302920	5303920	And...
5304920	5305920	And, like...
5305920	5306920	A racist joke.
5306920	5307920	And then, like, some...
5309920	5311920	And then there was, like, there was some black kid standing around,
5311920	5312920	and, like, he got...
5312920	5314920	He, like, kind of, like, felt like he was, like, pissed at me.
5314920	5315920	So I was just like, oh, shit.
5315920	5318920	So I just went up to him, and I was like, hey, man, like, I don't really mean it.
5318920	5319920	I'm just drunk. I'm just joking around, obviously.
5319920	5320920	Like, I don't mean it.
5320920	5321920	And he was like, all right, whatever.
5321920	5324920	We, like, you know, exchanged, you know, told each other names and stuff.
5324920	5326920	And then, like, a minute later, he was...
5326920	5328920	I think he was in a frat, and I think maybe he was talking to one of his
5328920	5332920	pledges or something, but he called some kid a faggot.
5332920	5336920	And I was like, dude, you can't get mad when I make a racist joke
5336920	5338920	and then call someone a faggot.
5338920	5339920	Like, that's...
5339920	5340920	That's not okay.
5340920	5341920	And he was just like, oh, really?
5341920	5342920	And he got all defensive.
5342920	5345920	And I was like, yes, you know, like, blacks are, like, you know,
5345920	5347920	they get shit, and then, like, so do gay people.
5347920	5350920	And, like, he got all defensive, and he was like, oh, really?
5350920	5351920	You know, got all like, oh, really?
5351920	5355920	Gays have gone through the same shit that blacks have, and I don't know.
5355920	5359920	I mean, you know, they're not shooting gay people to death in Ferguson.
5363920	5364920	There is a...
5364920	5365920	I mean, I...
5365920	5366920	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
5366920	5368920	Well, that's true, but they still hang around and beat them.
5368920	5369920	Yeah, yeah.
5369920	5370920	No.
5370920	5371920	So I'm like...
5371920	5374920	You just, like, either make jokes about everyone or jokes about no one.
5374920	5375920	You can't, like, say, like...
5375920	5376920	You can't...
5376920	5377920	You know...
5377920	5378920	Like...
5378920	5379920	I'm not...
5379920	5382920	I'm not gonna say, oh, you can make jokes about black people,
5382920	5384920	but as soon as you make a blind joke, fuck you.
5384920	5385920	Like, you know...
5386920	5387920	I don't know.
5387920	5389920	I think that any individual...
5390920	5393920	I think individuals are geniuses and populations are idiots.
5393920	5394920	I mean, I think that...
5394920	5395920	Yeah, that's...
5395920	5397920	Well, some individuals are idiots, too.
5397920	5398920	Some individuals...
5398920	5399920	Many individuals are idiots, too.
5399920	5400920	Yeah.
5400920	5407920	But I do think if you cornered an individual person from the quote-unquote black community
5407920	5413920	and deposed them about that, they would go, oh, you're absolutely right.
5413920	5416920	But I also think that you get swept up in the idea that...
5416920	5419920	And I don't say this for applause because I'm a white person.
5419920	5420920	I just...
5420920	5424920	Please don't applaud after I say this, but this is the thing that I always remind myself of.
5426920	5429920	I just asked you specifically not to do something.
5429920	5430920	You said not after.
5430920	5432920	Oh, you applied it before I said it.
5432920	5433920	Okay.
5436920	5439920	It really is profound when you realize, like, okay...
5440920	5447920	There's a huge amount of analogies you can draw for marginalized populations of any kind,
5447920	5457920	whether you're talking about nerds, the physically challenged, sexuality...
5457920	5463920	But race has this really distinct thing, which is you cannot...
5463920	5465920	You just don't have an option.
5465920	5468920	You wake up and you...
5468920	5470920	And I think that there's...
5470920	5474920	Even if that's not accurate, I think that there's a feeling underneath there.
5474920	5477920	It's like, I woke up black this morning, you know?
5477920	5479920	And it's not like I...
5479920	5481920	You chose to be gay.
5481920	5482920	No, no, no.
5482920	5483920	God damn it.
5483920	5484920	That's not what I mean.
5485920	5487920	That's not what I mean at all.
5487920	5488920	You chose to be a woman.
5488920	5492920	I just mean that gay people can look like straight people in line at the bank.
5492920	5496920	You mean that there's this overpowering presence of race all the time.
5496920	5500920	I mean that racism is really, really, really easy to accomplish.
5500920	5503920	You can accomplish it through closed windows of cars.
5503920	5505920	You can accomplish it across countries.
5505920	5508920	You can accomplish it through binoculars.
5508920	5513920	It's really unfairly easy to knock out.
5513920	5518920	We've had so much time to be racist, or learn what racist is.
5519920	5523920	We've had race in this country since we had this country, and we've always focused about it.
5523920	5527920	And all these other social issues that come up, people don't give them much time.
5527920	5531920	They haven't had 150 years to say, oh, yeah, maybe I'm wrong about that.
5531920	5538920	But please, please, everybody that's gay that's listening to me, don't mistake that for me saying that anything is harder than anything else.
5538920	5540920	I understand also...
5540920	5543920	I'm going to say that being black is harder than being gay. I'm sorry.
5544920	5549920	I will argue with you, because also it's like for the very sake...
5549920	5553920	I think it's apples and oranges for black people and gay people.
5553920	5557920	But apples are way better than oranges.
5561920	5568920	It's come to that point in the conversation where it's just a bunch of straight white people explaining things to black gay people.
5568920	5572920	It's like, whatever. It won't do any good from here.
5572920	5575920	It's apples and oranges. Do I get cherries?
5575920	5578920	And I don't want to pronounce anything.
5578920	5582920	I just want to say out loud, as a big fat straight white guy,
5582920	5587920	what fascinates me and what I think about when I'm laying in bed at night staring at the ceiling going,
5587920	5590920	what do blind people think? What do gay people think? What do black people think?
5590920	5594920	And by the way, God damn it, I'm a huge fan of blindness.
5595920	5601920	I can give you the advice. It's a lot cooler from the outside.
5605920	5612920	Really? It's not fun to be deprived of 90% of your primate senses.
5614920	5617920	Have you heard me on the podcast talk about...
5617920	5620920	I think I'm like 10 or 15 episodes behind.
5621920	5625920	So my sister was telling me, she was saying in episode 109 or something,
5625920	5628920	you were talking about blind people, but I have not gotten there yet.
5628920	5630920	I said you're full of shit.
5630920	5634920	I said you're the reason Ralph Nader got so many votes.
5635920	5637920	I'm damn proud of it.
5637920	5639920	No, you know, when I have said in the past...
5639920	5646920	Has any blind person in real life ever said to another person,
5646920	5651920	I want to see what you look like and then start touching their face.
5656920	5659920	I don't know all blind people, so I can't...
5664920	5666920	That's very...
5666920	5670920	Gilbert Godfrey, I want to know what you look like. Can I touch your face?
5670920	5677920	Touch his face. Touch his face.
5687920	5690920	Gilbert, get your face over to this guy.
5695920	5697920	He's coming.
5701920	5704920	That's a real nice face he got.
5707920	5710920	Anyway, the answer to that question is yes.
5710920	5711920	Yes, it just happened.
5711920	5712920	Can I just touch your face?
5712920	5715920	That may have been the first time, but it hasn't.
5715920	5717920	Do you know what his face looks like now?
5717920	5718920	Yeah.
5718920	5721920	I mean, I think I already knew.
5724920	5728920	Now, was the movie sent of a woman totally full of shit?
5731920	5733920	I'm not familiar with that.
5733920	5735920	Are you saying you didn't see it?
5740920	5741920	Well played, no.
5741920	5742920	No, I did not.
5742920	5744920	Old school blind jokes.
5744920	5748920	No, you would not be surprised like how many of my friends just like,
5748920	5750920	something will happen that I didn't expect them to be like,
5750920	5752920	huh, did you not see it coming?
5752920	5757920	And I'm like, all right, that was moderately clever the first seven times.
5757920	5758920	But I got hit by a brain.
5759920	5763920	So I just want to get some background because I mean, being blind,
5763920	5766920	what's the backstory, born in that way?
5766920	5769920	No, I was born blind in my right eye.
5769920	5772920	And I always had problems with my left eye.
5772920	5775920	I could never really read.
5775920	5776920	I could never really read.
5776920	5779920	I could kind of read large print, but not really that well.
5779920	5780920	So I always read Braille.
5780920	5784920	But I could see well enough to get around and stuff like that.
5784920	5788920	But it's I mean, there's like a lot of detail to go into.
5788920	5792920	And I honestly at this point, I can't tell stuff like told the story so many times
5792920	5795920	that I can't tell if it's boring or I'm just bored of telling it.
5795920	5797920	But it's probably somewhere in between.
5797920	5798920	Yeah, it's all right.
5798920	5799920	All right.
5799920	5802920	Then I'll give like, I'll give a few people have made content.
5802920	5805920	I was just this is going to be boring.
5805920	5808920	It's me explaining how why I thought it would be interesting of a blind person.
5808920	5810920	But it says it seems like such kismet.
5810920	5813920	I was just thinking about this yesterday.
5813920	5819920	I was thinking about this coming to New York going we've we have a podcast.
5819920	5820920	It's a new society.
5820920	5823920	I bet we have a lot of blind listeners.
5823920	5829920	I wonder if anybody out there like we've never brought a blind person up on stage.
5829920	5831920	I just want to point out that it's like magical.
5831920	5835920	But for me, you're so blessed.
5835920	5839920	You're like a magical blind person.
5839920	5841920	We're all secretly magical.
5841920	5842920	We just don't tell it.
5842920	5845920	Yeah, I feel like you could help me golf better.
5845920	5846920	Yeah.
5846920	5848920	Yeah.
5848920	5854920	You're like you're like the hitch of not seeing.
5854920	5857920	Yeah, more or less, I guess.
5857920	5862920	But yeah, I mean, this is this is a dumb digression.
5862920	5865920	And I think it's like a pre-internet like kind of thing.
5865920	5872920	But I remember being fascinated to read that deafness compared to blindness,
5872920	5877920	even though it technically, quote unquote, impairs you less.
5877920	5883920	Because obviously, as humans, we rely on our eyes more than we rely on our ears.
5883920	5889920	But that deaf people are basically for lack of a for lack of a more diplomatic
5889920	5893920	or longer way of saying it, that they are more alienated, isolated.
5894920	5897920	Yeah, a deaf person can get around better.
5897920	5901920	But obviously, there's a whole language thing.
5901920	5906920	Some deaf people can speak and read lips so they can communicate fine.
5906920	5910920	But yeah, obviously, sure, if you're blind, you can't see anything.
5910920	5911920	But you can still just ask people.
5911920	5914920	And you're still perfectly able to communicate.
5914920	5917920	I kind of wonder how much the internet changed that.
5917920	5921920	Because the internet changed everybody's lives in this audience who can see and hear.
5922920	5926920	But before the internet, there was deaf people and blind people.
5926920	5930920	And it's like the internet couldn't have polarized those communities more.
5930920	5939920	Because if you're blind before the internet, you had the internet of talking to people.
5940920	5942920	And deaf people didn't.
5942920	5945920	They took away our one advantage over deaf people.
5945920	5950920	And then once the internet happened, that was the one thing we had above them.
5951920	5954920	Are deaf people like vampires and werewolves and underworld?
5954920	5955920	No.
5956920	5960920	It's like blind people, deaf people, and people in wheelchairs.
5960920	5961920	And we're all at war with each other.
5964920	5965920	I see that movie.
5968920	5969920	It's all a big joke to me.
5969920	5970920	I love it.
5971920	5972920	Yeah.
5972920	5974920	Well, this is great.
5974920	5976920	I'm very proud of myself for this.
5976920	5977920	You know what?
5978920	5979920	You did a good thing.
5979920	5981920	You have definitely improved my life.
5981920	5982920	I really thank you a lot.
5982920	5986920	I hope you'd like to play Dungeons and Dragons with us up here.
5986920	5987920	Fuck yeah.
5987920	5988920	I love Dungeons and Dragons.
5988920	5990920	Spencer, you better not fuck this up.
5990920	5992920	Well, I mean, I hope...
5992920	5993920	Is it...
5993920	5995920	Should I give you the character sheet?
5995920	5996920	No, I mean...
5997920	5998920	That is a really good question.
5998920	6000920	I've just been stewing over here.
6000920	6001920	I didn't know what to say.
6003920	6005920	If I could like...
6005920	6006920	I'm trying to think like...
6006920	6009920	I could play like Quark and I just like know most of his like attacks anyway.
6009920	6011920	Pretty much just attacking with a sword.
6011920	6013920	Plus I really want to fuck things, so like...
6016920	6017920	I wouldn't...
6017920	6018920	I don't think I would...
6018920	6021920	Not to mention like no one else uses their character sheet anyway.
6021920	6023920	So I don't think I'd be at too much of a disadvantage.
6023920	6025920	I guarantee you that...
6025920	6026920	Yeah.
6026920	6029920	I have looked at mine as much as you would yours.
6031920	6032920	I guarantee it.
6032920	6033920	Yeah.
6033920	6034920	I'm not worried about it.
6034920	6035920	I actually...
6035920	6037920	I played D&D over the summer and yeah, it was a lot of fun.
6037920	6038920	Awesome.
6038920	6039920	Yeah.
6039920	6040920	Okay.
6040920	6042920	If I were Spencer, I'd be shitting my pants right now.
6042920	6045920	Because I feel like a blind person playing D&D is like...
6045920	6046920	What an honor for him.
6046920	6047920	I don't know.
6047920	6048920	Like a...
6048920	6049920	Like a...
6049920	6051920	Like a Spanish person taking a salsa class.
6054920	6056920	In what sense?
6056920	6057920	It's like...
6057920	6058920	I don't know.
6058920	6061920	It's just in their blood that they're gonna smell bullshit.
6062920	6063920	All right.
6063920	6064920	I got Sharpie.
6064920	6065920	I don't get it.
6065920	6066920	I'm gonna...
6066920	6067920	Excuse me.
6067920	6071920	So Gilbert, we play this game called Dungeons & Dragons.
6072920	6075920	And I don't know if you've ever played, but basically it's like...
6075920	6082920	Pretend that what I'm saying is real and pretend you're acting as a character in the setting that I'm describing with my mouth.
6084920	6085920	That doesn't make sense.
6085920	6086920	Oh, that makes it all clear.
6086920	6087920	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6088920	6090920	I promise it's the clearest way I could do it.
6092920	6094920	You don't listen to the podcast that much, right?
6094920	6095920	I'm not.
6095920	6096920	The owner should be a vendor.
6103920	6107920	I hope that's the guy who tweeted that same joke and not the guy who read that.
6110920	6112920	So just think of it as a jumping off point.
6112920	6115920	You don't actually have to make any sense of any of those pages.
6115920	6116920	Oh, wait.
6116920	6117920	That's good.
6117920	6121920	Can I just say one random, unrelated thing, but just something I've always wanted to...
6121920	6122920	No, sorry.
6125920	6129920	It would be amazing to find out what the limits of what you're allowed to say would be.
6129920	6132920	And you'd be like, why is Building 7 still standing?
6135920	6138920	And we're like, okay, all right, take it easy.
6138920	6140920	He's like, no, the melting point of steel.
6140920	6142920	And we're like, okay, take it easy.
6142920	6144920	Thanks for coming.
6145920	6148920	Why were there no Jews in the building?
6149920	6151920	Jesus Christ, Rory.
6154920	6155920	Yeah, go for it.
6155920	6159920	Yeah, this is just like a joke that I'm pretty sure...
6159920	6160920	Is it a racist joke?
6160920	6161920	No, I'm sorry.
6161920	6163920	I could probably think of a good one, but...
6163920	6165920	That's not why I asked.
6165920	6166920	No, okay, no.
6166920	6168920	It's a very not racist joke.
6168920	6172920	It's a really lame joke that I'm sure everyone has already heard.
6172920	6176920	But I wanted to tell it to Dan for a very specific reason.
6176920	6180920	All right, Dan, why do seagulls fly over the sea?
6181920	6182920	I don't know.
6182920	6185920	Because if they flew over the bay, they'd be called...
6185920	6186920	Oh, bagels.
6186920	6187920	Bagels.
6191920	6194920	Gilbert Guypreet is like, what the fuck is going on?
6194920	6196920	Because he doesn't know how to say bagel.
6196920	6199920	Yeah, I pronounce bagel wrong, Gilbert.
6199920	6200920	Well, no longer.
6201920	6203920	Yeah, you've got to write both of those things.
6203920	6207920	That's what people keep telling me, is just a picture of the word bagel.
6207920	6208920	Right?
6208920	6209920	Is that it?
6209920	6210920	Bagel?
6210920	6211920	Bagel.
6212920	6214920	I think you can say it both ways, though.
6214920	6218920	I think if you actually look stuff up, a lot of these words that are contentions,
6218920	6223920	both of the pronunciations are just right, and everyone just argues about it, like it matters.
6225920	6227920	I would like a bagel.
6228920	6229920	I've never had tomato.
6231920	6232920	I would like a bagel.
6233920	6235920	Again, I'm not going to correct it.
6235920	6236920	I think it's all good.
6237920	6238920	I'd like a bagel.
6241920	6243920	From Ronald Reagan.
6245920	6247920	Because it's vague.
6249920	6250920	Vague?
6251920	6252920	All right.
6252920	6253920	All right.
6255920	6260920	All right, so, okay, well, I gave Gilbert Gottfried Christoperg,
6260920	6262920	and I gave...
6262920	6264920	I'm sorry, it's justcini?
6264920	6265920	Justcini.
6265920	6266920	Justcini.
6266920	6267920	Justcini.
6267920	6268920	Justcini.
6269920	6270920	Sounds like...
6270920	6271920	I don't know why that sounds worse.
6271920	6272920	Justcini.
6272920	6275920	I gave Justcini dignity, Sarah's guard.
6276920	6279920	After thinking about it for a long time.
6280920	6282920	And so Rory...
6282920	6285920	Oh, just because he's gay, you're making him a woman.
6285920	6286920	God damn it.
6288920	6290920	He's blind, but he sees everything.
6296920	6297920	That's...
6298920	6300920	That's why I ruminated on it.
6300920	6302920	I was like, God damn it.
6303920	6307920	So, Harmon, do you want to do your acapella thing?
6307920	6309920	Oh, sure, yeah, I'll do...
6310920	6313920	We've been without music for a while and coping with it.
6316920	6319920	We're playing Dungeons and Dragons now, Gilbert.
6319920	6320920	Okay.
6325920	6327920	Last time on Harmon Town.
6327920	6328920	Our heroes...
6328920	6330920	I got to say this stuff.
6331920	6332920	I got to say it.
6333920	6337920	Our heroes had just defeated Father Tinder and were dealing with his corpse.
6337920	6343920	As the gang fled, they were accosted by a night watchman who seemed to be wise to their tricks.
6343920	6346920	But dignity, Sarah's guard smoothed things over.
6346920	6350920	Just when they thought they were safe, they found themselves surrounded by guards.
6350920	6355920	But dignity and her mighty steed provided the gang with a much needed egress as they escaped the town.
6355920	6359920	However, leaving the safety of the town would prove to be a dangerous move.
6359920	6365920	And no sooner than our heroes had escaped, Admiral Darkstar took after them with the fury of hell.
6365920	6375920	After screaming an elemental summoning, Admiral Darkstar noticed the shard of power floating away from the city and abandoned our heroes to give chase.
6375920	6379920	Dignity's mount, pissed on a fire elemental, pissing off his leg.
6379920	6384920	And with that, our heroes escaped the flaming foe, finding freedom in a foul fen.
6384920	6392920	People love alliteration. They love it. I love it too.
6392920	6396920	Approaching the first door they saw, our heroes encountered a showering woman.
6396920	6404920	And after terrifying slash objectifying her, our heroes plated off like it was no big thing and asked for her help.
6404920	6410920	But what thing was going to happen? How would the gang whatever? And what of the blank?
6410920	6413920	Find out next time on Placeholder.
6413920	6421920	All right.
6430920	6433920	All right. So everybody has questions, right? Yeah.
6433920	6437920	Questions. This is that point in the D&D where everyone goes, what's going on?
6437920	6443920	I mean, and this is like, I usually know what's going on, but I'm a bit fuzzy if I'm honest.
6443920	6447920	Like I'm like, like 15 episodes behind, so I absolutely know.
6447920	6453920	Yeah. And we also just released the last episode that happened today, so I didn't even get a chance to listen to it.
6453920	6459920	Needless to say, they left the village and arrived at a naked woman's house.
6459920	6461920	And we were looking through the window at her.
6461920	6462920	Yeah. Showering.
6462920	6463920	And then we came in through her door.
6464920	6474920	I mean, you looked at the window. She saw you doing that, freaked out. And then you entered her house to keep her quiet.
6474920	6480920	OK, so that's right. Yeah. OK, so I'm yeah, we're in. OK, I can. OK.
6480920	6488920	Young lady, is she young? She's she's you can't tell her age. She might be elvish.
6488920	6493920	Lady, take it easy. We just need a place to hide out. See?
6497920	6506920	Yeah. It doesn't seem like a very convincing statement, but when you put it out there, she's like, I guess that makes sense.
6506920	6515920	I mean, it is one of the only windows in this swamp. So we're we're we're we're within the confines of Rose Rose Rose.
6515920	6522920	No, you're outside a rose. But that's you. Yeah, you went. You ran off into a swamp. Do you have any questions?
6522920	6530920	I stop paying attention. I know. That's fine, too. I mean, I'm not going to I'm not going to complain.
6530920	6536920	I guess he has a question. Well, then we can't help you.
6536920	6546920	What's your question? Tell me, is this a continuous. Yeah, yeah, yes. Yeah.
6546920	6554920	But I'd like to think no one has to know or does know anything that happens. Yeah. Yeah.
6554920	6560920	But just because it's a terrible idea, just pretend some people entered a naked lady's house. You're all set.
6561920	6568920	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's honestly it's it's the worst idea in the history of entertainment. Yeah. Yeah.
6568920	6577920	OK. And now it's like imagine if every week Ugly Betty was about something different.
6577920	6586920	But she was she was a different kind of ugly. And it just it was always it was on CBS every other week.
6586920	6592920	And then like they moved kept moving it between Friday and Wednesday. And it's just a bad idea all around.
6592920	6604920	And somehow we keep loving it. Like Ugly Betty. Gilbert, just just just say anything. Just riff. Yeah.
6604920	6612920	Just so I've given up. Just so we can say that you played. I don't know what this whole thing's about.
6612920	6620920	It's acting. But instead of a stage, I'm saying the stage. It's like it's like an improvised radio play.
6620920	6630920	There you go. So we're we're in a naked girl's apartment. Yeah. In a swamp. Yeah.
6631920	6642920	Didn't land. Yeah. Hey, great. It's all right there. We played D&D with Gilbert Godfrey. That's what's important.
6642920	6654920	We did it. And Rory is going. I have no idea what your tits look like. Well, Rory plays a character who can see.
6654920	6665920	Oh, I'm sorry. However, I could probably feel them for inspection. Yeah. Yeah. Has Cork fucked her yet? No, no.
6665920	6674920	I feel like that's I feel like that's like less cool when it's actually like a human. Like if it's like some sort of if it's like some sort of animal, you can just be like, oh, yeah, I'm going to fuck it.
6674920	6683920	But like as soon as like it's an actual woman, I feel weird being like, oh, I'm going to fuck her like that. So maybe that makes me feel weird, too.
6684920	6692920	All right. Ma'am. Ma'am. Yeah. Yeah. I got tits. I know. Please cover yourself. I grab. Oh, no, I did. Sorry.
6692920	6709920	OK. My platoon mates and I were fleeing a dark force that threatens to overtake the world. And we just came in here, I think, for maybe food. Are you asking me?
6710920	6724920	You know what? You know what it occurs to me? We had no reason to come in here. I think it was just there was a naked woman. So it seemed like we're all going to back out and we're all going to we're going to move to the next place.
6724920	6733920	Where's the next place? We're not sure, but we're just going to keep moving in the same direction we were moving. All right. And we were sorry for the interruption.
6733920	6748920	And life is the thing that happens between your plans to do other things, as John Lennon once said. And we're just going to leave and we're going to head to the next place.
6748920	6757920	And we were very sorry. And you'll notice we didn't we didn't objectify you. I mean, I hate to disagree.
6758920	6778920	He just said nice tits. Oh, well, my friend, I mean, he's he's not wrong. It's it's it's it's a middle middle medieval fantasy world like like like a lot of people are very unattractive and you look great.
6779920	6793920	But that's not the same as objectifying you. I don't think that the way you look is who you are. I think I'm making the assumption right off the bat that you probably are some kind of scientist.
6796920	6807920	But I don't think it's inaccurate for my friend to say nice tits. But in either case, I say we're leaving. We're leaving. All right. We're leaving. We'll see. So long. What was your name?
6808920	6821920	Charles. Charles. It's a it's a family name. All right, Charles. Thank you. Bye. Let's guys. Let's get out of here. Yeah. OK.
6821920	6835920	We leave and then we go to the next week. We just keep going. Go. What does that mean? You keep going going in the same direction in the same line. We were fleeing the city and then we came across this place. We keep moving. We keep going.
6835920	6859920	You you enter a swampy land. It's it's become too swampy to really walk. OK, we go back to the naked lady's house. I knock on our door this time and I go this time we're not we're not coming in. OK. Hoping this can be a reboot of an encounter that started off on the wrong foot.
6860920	6888920	Well, now I'm all confused. Well, you just said you were leaving and you're already back. Well, ma'am, I we we're fleeing, as I said, an evil force. We stopped by your place. We we we we left. It's you. You live in a swamp. We're not sure what to do. Yeah. What exactly were we like trying to accomplish? Well, I wouldn't know. That's a weird thing for you to ask a complete stranger.
6889920	6903920	I was talking to Sharpie. Well, ma'am, I want to hear. I want you to hear this. The answer to his question to ma'am. We we're running for our lives and we're cowards and we're just running from from from things that might hurt us.
6904920	6923920	And so I ask you if you've ever felt weak in a moment in your life and if you could if you could connect that moment in your life to this moment in our life, which would be empathy and like maybe there'll be sympathy, empathy. You wouldn't need a moment in your life to connect with someone else. Damn.
6924920	6946920	All right. Now it's boring. Burned. And you're a naked woman with great tits and a beard beard. She's a beard. I don't think she's naked anymore. Is she? What? She's not naked anymore. No, no, she put on clothes. I'm sorry. All right. Let's leave. Let's leave. No, nothing for you.
6946920	6975920	Ma'am, honestly, all we want to do is get our bearings and figure out where to go from here. It's just that you're surrounded by marsh. I know. And we we we just need a place to sit at a table and look over some maps. Did you not need this five minutes ago when you were inside my house, ma'am? I'm not going to try to convince you that we're an organized adventuring party.
6977920	7000920	We're not. We never advertise that. We never said, hey, it's us. We know what we're doing. We are a group of people who who are who are running from things. We don't want to engage them. We came across you. We acted impulsively, mistakenly. We fucked up. We tried to correct that. We we we wandered into the wilderness. You live in a swamp. We're back.
7000920	7029920	We're asking now, ma'am, if we could just sit at your table and just look at some maps. I don't know if you have atlases or just figure out where we are. Get our parents. Truth is, ma'am, like we a lot of times we're very drunk. We don't know. We don't know what we're doing. And we're very embarrassed. And it's not like we don't expect acknowledgement of that to be a path.
7030920	7058920	A free pass, but we're out in your porch and we can make a day of it out here or we could come in and share some holy text with you. Read some holy text with you. That's cool, right? I didn't hear that. I'm sorry. I could share some holy text with you. We could. Oh, you know, I love reading. He's got some holy texts. I really enjoy reading. Okay. Well, see, it's really about just peeling back layers and wait. What?
7059920	7076920	It's about peeling back layers reading. I feel like we should figure out some way to get through the swamp. I don't know if the plots going to advance here. Yeah. I mean, if you guys want to kill some shit. So all right. Okay, ma'am, ma'am. You know what? Sorry to bother you.
7077920	7103920	We're going to head into the swamp. We're going to head into the swamp. Well, I mean, we have to apparently we can't walk in it. So we have to figure out some way of like getting somewhere else and not just be trapped in this house. I agree. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is there like a ma'am? Goodbye. Are you? Are you sure you're done? Yeah. Okay. It's just, I mean, even even even ingest if you could give us a direction.
7103920	7132920	Just any direction? Yeah. Well, just like when you leave, where do you go? Well, I take the main road back towards town. The way we came from? Yeah. Okay. Well, when you want to get away from there. Can you can you take the main road like away from town? Yeah. I mean, yeah, it splits up. You go past the town. You could go left near the main road. Yeah.
7133920	7162920	The town. Yeah. All sorts of directions. Yeah. But all back towards the town. Well, initially, sure. But then the roads, they go in other directions, all sorts of ways. All right. So we'll head back toward town. Wait, what? Do we need to leave to Vince's prices house? I don't know who that is. Or John Lennon. All right. Yeah. Well, this guy. Okay. Well, bye ma'am. Bye.
7162920	7191920	Bye. Have a nice life. I was. Sorry for the interruption. Thank you. What are you doing? We had, we had back down the road back toward town, I guess. But back towards and then past town to areas unknown. Yeah, hopefully. Yes. Well, yeah. I mean, like, yeah. So you had you head towards town and you see, you see barring your path, hopping along on one fiery foot of fire elemental missing a leg.
7192920	7218920	You recall him from your past travels in which you made your horse pee on him. Right. Is this someone like we were fighting before? Yes. So we should kill them. So I should piss on the other leg. I didn't hear that. So I should piss on the other leg. Yeah. Yeah. Gilbert attack. This would be a good time for you to attack. Okay, I'm attacking now.
7219920	7243920	Oh, wait, can I, I'm rushing forward with a violent attack. So while you're rushing forward with this violent attack, are you, are you wielding a dagger or poison dagger? Both. I have a regular dagger in my left hand and the poison dagger in my right. Yeah. There you go. Now you're getting that.
7244920	7266920	Wielding both of these daggers, you plunge them deep in the beast's fiery high. Right. Deal some amount of damage. 14 damage. Wow. Gilbert Gottfried is great at Dungeons and Dragons.
7267920	7289920	You feel the heat rating off of the elementals fiery body, but you pull away before it can burn you. That's just a yeah. Okay. Someone else do something. Can I fuck him? I mean, I'm not asking. I'm just saying I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna sneak up behind him and try to fuck him.
7290920	7303920	And then if that, if that doesn't count as my entire turn, I want to like attack him with, I want to go into a, I want to go into a barbarian rage, fuck him and then attack him with my flaming sword, flaming sword attack.
7304920	7310920	I can't wait for Jeff to come back to the podcast so I can tell him this is his effect on blind youth.
7311920	7323920	Flying into a barbarian rage, you sense all feelings and emotions and not those logic and stuff. The other one leaving, leaving, being replaced with rage and passion.
7324920	7336920	As you undo your pants and enter the fiery fiend. You realize that the fire. Yeah, that's what you realize. It's worth it. Well worth it.
7337920	7341920	Your, uh, your dick takes 12 damage.
7347920	7353920	That's a victory. That's probably all for the best. Yeah. That's a good point.
7354920	7357920	Feeling, feeling your dick melt off.
7357920	7367920	We only have one dick left in this party. I'm sorry, Jeff Davis, wherever you are. I melted your dick.
7368920	7373920	Reeling back. Really trench it metaphor for what happened to our country during Vietnam.
7373920	7387920	Reeling back from this incident, you, you lunge into attack for a hurting, hurting your member and maybe it's just the fact your entire dick was melted off.
7388920	7394920	But it goes wide and your axe fall or your sword falls blade first into the soil, missing it completely.
7394920	7410920	I'm sorry. All right, just Siri. Well, detecting evil. I feel like we've misjudged this fire demon. Yeah. Okay.
7411920	7422920	Detecting, detecting evil. You do notice it's not an evil spirit. It seems neutral. If anything, he melted my dick off. So I say we kill him.
7422920	7445920	Well, so would an ordinary campfire. Yeah. This is such a classic conflict between a blind guy and a gay black guy. I mean, I'm pretty sure we're on the same team. I don't think we're quarreling.
7445920	7473920	Not yet. I'll lay mercy on my team member's burning member. Oh yeah. Laying hands on this. This is a classy move on the shiny Ken doll like crotchel region. You instantly feel your pain going away, but you don't instantly feeling your dick come back.
7474920	7492920	That doesn't happen. You're going to need some serious magic to pull that off. That's dicks for you. Can't live with them. Sharpies turn. It's my turn.
7492920	7521920	Raise the dead. I don't think wizards can raise the dead at seventh level. Also, why raise the dead? Yes. I think he just wants to end the show. I think my high brother is here. I know. But actually, what? Yeah. What do I know? I mean, that might've been a great ending. Yeah. Shit. I'm looking at my spells. I'm looking at my spells. Yeah. Ray of frost. Come on.
7522920	7551920	I'm telling you guys. Ray of frost is a level zero spell that does like two damage. Ray of frost is like garbage. Yeah. I mean, if he's vulnerable for fire, it might do up to six damage. Still not very good. Scorching. Just let me look for a second. Let me look for a second.
7553920	7570920	Would a reduced person work on an elemental? No. They're outsiders. Or elementals. I don't know which. Talk to them? Hey, listen. Verbal abuse. We mean you no harm.
7570920	7599920	It looks like you have to say, I didn't think you were until I got raped. But who really got raped? It looks at you as if to say me. But his dicks burnt off. I'm the real victim here. I'm literally made of fire. Exactly. And that's why we- I was born this way.
7599920	7623920	And we were born all of the ways that we were born. And we don't- I'm telling you, I swear to God, from the bottom of our heart, if we've transgressed, we are sorry for it. I'm not. I'm still pissed. I still want to kill him. In the immortal words of hedonism bot, I apologize for nothing.
7623920	7652920	Well, it lobs a fireball at you then. You take some amount of damage. Quark. Nineteen damage. Wait, what? What the fuck did I ever do? What did you do? Just fucked a plane. You told it you're not sorry you raped it. No, not sorry. Not sorry.
7652920	7677920	I tried to rape him before my dick got melted off. Attacking a blind kid. That's not cool. I don't know, man. Okay. Well, guys, it's not my turn. I think it's Gilbert's turn. Gilbert, Gilbert, think really hard about what you do. He's the only one who's done anything good. You could save this game.
7677920	7705920	I can't even fake this, because I don't know what the fuck this game is all about. It's about killing this guy. Just try to talk sense into it. Just be Gilbert Gottfried and just talk to this fire elemental and just tell it that we didn't mean it. Okay, we didn't mean it. We did. We did.
7705920	7733920	I'll go along with anything at this point. I think that's the problem. These are all great suggestions. I think Gilbert, just if I could if I could ask you to try just in the form of a monologue.
7733920	7755920	Just like beseech this thing to be peaceful with us. No. And then Spencer can roll his die because you'll be you'll be attempting diplomacy with this thing. But you you as Gilbert Gottfried, you have to you have to try to convince this fire elemental to be peaceful with us. That's my suggestion.
7755920	7783920	Now, now, what was this again? He says you want to kill him. I want to kill him and I'm diplomatic about it. Oh, I'm lost. I'm telling you. I'm saying to you instead just say to this thing. It shouldn't want to fight with us. We want to be peaceful with it. And just in the form of a monologue as only Gilbert Gottfried could accomplish.
7783920	7811920	A master diplomat just making peace with this thing. It's a fire monster. Oh, he's a fire monster. And he no longer has great tits. This thing does not have great tits. It's a fair monster. Oh, please fire monster. Who doesn't have great tits?
7812920	7826920	Who doesn't have great tits? But may or may not have a beard. I gave up on that a while ago. Please don't kill us. Oh, fire monster.
7827920	7828920	Thank you.
7836920	7845920	It looks as you as if to say, I'm really tired of this. And it hops. It hops away on one leg. We did it.
7846920	7860920	Gilbert Gottfried saved our party. Is that how he had come to the dragon? It could be. I think it is. Yeah, it sounds like it. Gilbert Gottfried did it.
7861920	7863920	That's been our podcast.
