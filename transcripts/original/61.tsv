0	14640	Live from the Nerd Melon Theater in beautiful Hollywood, California, Harman Town is now
14640	15640	in session.
15640	25640	And now, let's welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harman Town, also my man, Dan Harman.
25640	36640	Thank you, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry about everything.
36640	42400	Well you were here, I mean, we were all, we all thought everything was fine.
42400	53360	I am out of practice at being quite so clickable, clickably delicious, I'm fine with it, I don't
53360	62000	know if anyone was bothering to feel sorry for me, but I'm getting really used to this.
62000	70480	I have a publicist now whose job is to make me less famous.
70480	74400	He's a really cool guy, I don't imagine he'd ever come on the show and answer questions
74400	76800	about what it means to be Dan Harman's publicist.
76800	78800	I think that would be a really interesting interview.
78800	83080	Can you talk about your Hollywood Reporter photo shoot?
83080	91600	No, I can't because it's technically a joke that involves a concept that I can't.
91600	94400	Sorry, I've already screwed up, I gotta write a letter to the internet.
94400	101760	Comptroller Erin McGathey, let us know what that sounds like.
101760	110800	Well let's just, I think I can beat around that word and not be quotable and yeah, obviously
110800	119000	as my publicist, this guy, he's got his hands full sometimes and they came to do a photo
119000	126600	shoot of me for this article that it's like Dan's happy and he's humble and he's back
126600	133160	and he's happy to be back at work and he was like, yeah, just smile a lot, don't let
133160	143480	him get any pictures of you frowning or doing anything other than just smiling a lot.
143480	149240	There's no sets at Paramount that are up, yeah, construction hasn't begun, but there
149240	153360	is one facade that's like, if you're a huge fan of community, you might know what I'm
153360	156960	talking about when I say Borchard Hall.
156960	162080	It's across on the Paramount lot from where the library steps usually are, but the library
162080	166560	steps aren't there and so this is the only thing, it's got the Greendell insignia on
166560	173600	the door and it says Borchard Hall at the top and the photographer told me, yeah, just
173600	178440	go through the door and then you're coming in so you just kind of open the door a little
178440	180760	bit and stick your head through.
180760	187240	Long story short, very creepy photo.
187240	197440	Daddy's home and he's been drinking and publicist face just purple, yeah, but I remember I had
197440	200960	brought him on for a while in season, I don't know, was it two or three or something like
200960	207360	that because I actually felt like, well, if people want to do interviews with me and stuff
207360	212640	that can help get ratings for the show, it's a form of promotion if I bring him on out
212640	218840	of pocket and stuff, so originally his job was to help me be famous, I think that's generally
218840	223680	what a publicist's job was, they'd probably say it's more nuanced than that and also just
223680	228640	get me Comic Con badges or something, I don't know, he's just a handy guy to have around
228640	231600	and then I let him go after a while because I was like, well, okay, no one's ever going
231600	237200	to watch the show no matter what and also I got fired and blah, blah, blah, I was like,
237200	244560	take some time off, cool your jets, but I brought him back on to actually just help
244560	254160	me, God, save me from myself, anyways, yeah, so it is a funny thing, this new phenomenon,
254160	265120	it's called context, it's a weird, weird thing, I've said many times this is my therapy,
265120	269160	I have enough voices bouncing around in my head to deal with, I don't want my own in
269160	274360	there too, and when I say the stuff that's in my head into a microphone and people laugh
274360	286640	or even just sit there and don't stab me, it's done, it's finished, it's dealt with,
286640	292960	and so every once in a while from this crucible, this 60 episode run of this online diary that
292960	299800	I'm keeping called Armantown, this little magma drop of Harmon-ness flies out and lands
299800	308160	in the Shire, it just bursts everything into flail, and you realize, oh God, I mean, yeah,
308160	314960	guess what, everybody that was hurt or anything like that, I guarantee you that when I want
314960	321560	to speak to you in the form of a headline and variety, I'll say much, much nicer things
321560	327000	than I do to my bathroom mirror or here or stuff like that, I'm not excusing anything,
327000	332880	I just wanted to make that clear, why do these things happen, you know, language is important
332880	337080	to me too, I'm a writer, definitely, but I improvise when I'm up here, and I've said
337080	343640	some really horrible things, anybody who wants to really, really hate me, go through, I don't
343640	348480	know what will happen to you, I've never listened to all of it either, but it's there, I am
348480	357200	here for you, I am on Twitter, I blog my apologies when I do things wrong, I do the
357200	364200	Reddit AMAs, I like being in touch with people, I think the big takeaway from this latest
364200	369720	debacle for me emotionally was I gotta somehow figure out at the age of 40 how to stop caring
369720	377320	so much, like what about people's opinion of me, because I think that the reason I do
377320	381760	what I do, I know that the reason I do what I do is to make people like me, and I'm very
381760	385360	comfortable with the idea that what you're supposed to like is the thing that I make,
385360	393400	so like there's nothing inappropriate or wrong way rubbing about an episode of my NBC sitcom,
393400	398260	like it is, and there's nothing dishonest about it either, it is an actual genuine Valentine
398260	403840	to humanity that I have time to prepare and polish and put on my little bow tie and show
403840	409040	up to your door with flowers and candy, like that's me at my best for you in that context
409040	413200	so that you will go, oh I feel happy right now, who made me happy, oh it says created
413200	422880	by so and so, oh he must be a good person, and I guess, I gotta cop to the fact that
422880	432440	I never will be, I guess, or nobody's a good person, and like if you, I'm, you know, Steve
432440	438360	Levitan doesn't have like a show where he just like babbles into a microphone with a
438360	445880	cup of vodka, and that's why he is a better person than me and will die richer and have
445880	451120	higher ratings and be more successful, god he's so handsome too, have you ever seen a
451120	462360	photo of, Google Steve Levitan, it's obnoxious, like he's so good looking, so anyways, I
462520	466840	happened just by pure circumstance and I thought, you know, just to Spencer showing up and saying
466840	471880	I want to be a dungeon master, like, Harmon Town kind of runs on coincidences and mysticism
471880	482840	and shamanic, like events, I was at a bar, that is not an unusual event, that's just
482840	489960	statistics, I was at a bar and ran into friends of our producer Dusty Samples, Dustin Marshall,
490120	502760	and these two adorable little kids, they're from this band called Mars Argo, and they just recently,
502760	507800	I mean, they're, you know, they're great, and they, I assume, I have a horrible taste of music,
507800	517080	but they just recently did this thing where they did a song, I think it was called Don't Call Me,
517160	525560	is that the name of the song? Okay, it's based on a sample of the iPhone ringtone marimba that
525560	530200	we all know, like when you hear the song for the first eight seconds, you're checking your pockets
530200	536680	and like, it's like a baby crying on an airplane for that eight seconds because, and it's a song
536680	541960	about a guy that won't stop calling and it fits, and after a while you stop hearing that and just
541960	547240	hear like a really nice song, and it's good, it doesn't matter if it's a good song or bad song,
547240	553720	the interesting thing is that because it uses that iPhone sample, all of a sudden, much as
553720	558200	sometimes a harm in town droplet lands in the headlines of variety, and all of a sudden I'm
558200	567320	being compared to Charlie Sheen by society, when I'm a writer, okay,
568200	576920	um, these guys, because of this iPhone hook, you know, it's now it's a, you know, all of a sudden
576920	582600	it's just a thing, it's got to, I guess, I'll be an old fogey and say it went viral, it was like in
584120	589720	the technology section of this thing, and the Apple lovers section of this thing, and the what's
589720	595880	going on section of this and that, kind of like it was a virality happened, and as a result, they
596760	602920	suddenly found themselves as very emotional, wonderful, passionate musicians, and something
602920	607880	that's become increasingly familiar to me, which is being under this, the microscope of this giant
607880	614520	blob called people who don't normally give a fuck about you, and let's continue the conversation
614520	619160	with them on stage, please welcome Titanic Sinclair and Marzargo of Marzargo.
625880	632120	Hey, I'm kind of short, so.
633560	639560	That's good, that's good these days. I wore shorts too. Short, short, short is the new tall. Cute,
639560	643800	cute matching hats guys. Who's unplanned? We're, we're dinkies.
645560	650840	Uh, so you get, so, so, so describe, the reason I called you guys, I asked you guys if you would
650840	658120	come here, is because I ran into Titanic, it's a stage name. Because, because of the death threats.
659320	666760	I, and, and, and, uh, uh, Marz was not there, and, uh, you were looking, uh, kind of, you were, you
666760	675080	were chill, I won't say sullen, you were, you were, you were, uh, uh, your, your emo had a, had a,
675160	681720	had an extra genuine emo to it. Uh, something there and, and, and, and, and, and under,
682840	686680	immediately, in a short conversation it turned out, Marz was at home,
687480	694280	unable to really go out because of the, the, the response in the comments sections under these,
694280	697640	under these videos that are being posted, right? That's the,
697640	703720	Well, I'm also actually sick, but, um, yeah, I think maybe the, the whole thing kind of threw
704520	708760	probably lowered your immune system. Like my, my, my cat's living with a dog now. I think she's
708760	713480	going to, she has FIB. I'm worried that she's going to die at any moment because I think that
713480	717720	T cells, like, you know, I think they're linked to your, your emotional dancing that he thinks
717720	724600	you're going to die. Um, but I don't know where to start. By the way, I'm a horrible interviewer,
724600	730920	uh, to deal with it, but, uh, do you want to, do you want to, do you, do you have in your head
730920	735400	an example of like a comment that really got you, like, like, that, that made you unable to leave
735400	744520	your home? Uh, what an ugly singer. No, what an ugly voice. Yeah. No, I, it's almost worse than
744520	750920	what an ugly singer. I guarantee you we've been threatened with dying of fire more than anyone
750920	757320	else. Burn in a fire. I hope you, because like we, we, we have like a, a YouTube channel. It's
757320	762840	called grocery bag that TV, if anyone's interested. And it's like, um, we like poke fun at social
762840	768680	commentary and stuff. And, um, so people like consistently, you know, tell us to die in a
768680	773400	fire. So I'm used to that, but this kind of spiraled out of control. Like I knew like we were
773400	779160	like getting ourselves into trouble by using the iPhone song to begin with, but I had no idea it
779160	783960	was going to be like so intense. You thought it would be critical trouble. Like you were used to
783960	790840	a certain context. Like I am here. Like you knew that something you did as most artists are required
790840	796360	to do was, was going to be hit or miss or ha and have some polarizing effect. But you were, I think
796360	802600	that like, like, like not to put words in your mouth, but like the effect of, of all of a sudden
802600	807960	this whole new audience called just people who don't, they're just re they're just reacting to
809000	813000	something random. They just see a headline that has nothing to do with that. That was the,
813000	819640	that was the big trouble that I got into. Cause I came out here and I, I reacted to the, the boohoo
819640	824680	for me, such a sensation of watching a season of the show that I hadn't watched the entire time.
824680	829720	It was without me. And I, I just kind of came out here and was like, just without thinking about
829720	835880	any kind of context or who was listening, except for these 150 people and anyone that listens to
835880	840360	a podcast about me and therefore like why, why would someone that hated me and didn't care what
840360	844840	I had to say, like this blah, blah, blah. I just kind of, I just kind of didn't think and just spoke
844840	849560	and then, but then immediately and it's like, why wouldn't I like, like, like this headline
849560	855400	just goes like this. Dan Harmon says this in the, in the, has a headline. It's like, no, that was not,
855400	860840	that was not a headline. That wasn't a press conference. And now the, the, the horrible
860840	867000	thing is you have people who, who, even if they are horrible people, they're not even like really
867000	871880	to blame for the fact that like, like, like if you're surfing through the internet and a
871880	882600	thing says under sports and weather, it says band makes song out of a ringtone and then they click
882600	887960	on it and then, and then they watch the thing and it's like, like, I don't know what makes them go
887960	892840	as far. I've never done that before. I have never left a comment that I thought would make someone
892920	899160	want to kill themselves. I have to assume given my, as a, as a study of, as a student of human
899160	903080	character, I have to assume that the reason people do that is because they don't believe it's
903080	907160	possible. They don't, they, it's like shooting a slingshot at the moon, you know, they're just
907160	912280	going like, Hey, why don't you kill yourself? You stupid, ugly person with a horrible voice. This
912280	916520	is a terrible song. Your band sucks, blah, blah. They're, they're just thinking like, well, they'll
916520	925960	never listen to old Toby Simmons. But the irony is that you guys are Toby Simmons. You're just a
925960	931560	band from Detroit that is out in Hollywood and you're just like, it's not like, and, and, and
931560	937240	everyone is Toby Simmons. Like every, every, we are now all in contact with each other. Do you, do
937240	941640	you guys, what, what band was that that like got in that airplane accident and they were like,
941640	948680	one of them was like rolling out of the plane on fire. So of course, because it's blink one 82,
948680	953480	like, yeah, well it's okay for them to burn to death. Like, like, like people just leaving
953480	961640	comments like, I forgot, I forgot. People are now going to publish transcripts of my podcast.
963080	968760	Do you put, please put some brackets in there that I was being ironic and put brackets behind
968760	974760	everything that says I'm a human fucking being. Don't, don't, don't publish transcripts of podcasts.
974760	981080	It's all free. It's all online. Like, like anyways, uh, he said winkingly.
984680	988840	It's okay for blink one 82 to be on fire, right? Because they don't deserve anything that they
988840	992600	have and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And it's like the people are saying, they're saying,
992600	996440	you're saying like, they're threatening you. They say die by fire. You're actually used to that.
997400	1002600	But bands die in fires a lot. Like it happens. Like, that's, that's a, that's an issue.
1005160	1007320	More, more bands than lion tamers.
1009240	1013960	Lion tamers get sometimes bit by lions. Like that would be rude to like,
1013960	1019080	leave under Siegfried and Roy's like YouTube channel. Like, oh, I hope you get bit by a lion.
1019080	1032600	Mean. But it's so like, I talk about like being at home. Like, like, like that night
1032600	1036760	when I was at the drawing room, like, like, what, what, what do you, what do you, what did you
1036760	1041800	physically do? Like, cause I know, well, actually I don't know. Did you, did you sit there and
1041800	1046920	troll through all the comments used to scroll through? It's weird cause it started on Reddit
1046920	1053320	and usually like a lot of our stuff gets posted on Reddit and like I use Reddit like crazy. So
1053320	1056520	it's usually pretty friendly, but I could tell right off the bat from like the first
1057960	1063480	couple of comments, like it wasn't going to be good. And then I don't know. Like we,
1063480	1068040	I read a couple and it was like, you know, the general consensus was this is annoying.
1068040	1071640	Her voice is annoying. And like, you get to a point where it's like every single comment and
1071640	1075880	then the views start going up and then you're just like, I'm just going to stop reading these now.
1075880	1080600	Yeah. But no, but I keep reading. I'm like an idiot. Did you get to the point? I don't know if
1080600	1084840	you could, if I don't know if you're able to answer this question. Do you, do you, have you
1084840	1089240	gotten to the point where you wish that the song didn't exist? Do you wish that you hadn't created
1089240	1093160	something? I don't know. I mean, like when we track that, like, you know, we had two engineers
1093160	1097720	that bailed on us, like right when we were tracking it and like, so I knew it like, what do you mean by
1097720	1101960	that? Just like when we were actually shooting the thing, like, you know, we're doing this on a
1101960	1106520	shoestring and like two engineers that agreed to do it didn't show up on the day of the shoe. And
1106520	1111000	then we had issues with like camera stuff and everything. So like, I knew like before I released
1111000	1116120	it that it wasn't like my favorite thing or like it wasn't the best vocal take, or maybe it wasn't
1116120	1121080	the best mix or whatever. But at the same time, I'm like, whatever, you know, like, but your job
1121080	1125720	as an artist is to just like put it out there, you know, and take off the top of your head to hold
1125720	1131000	a piece of paper to get, get as accurate a print of you give you who you are during your limited
1131000	1135720	time on this planet and get it out there. Right. And so I did, I was like, uncomfortable, but I was
1135720	1141400	just like, All right, there you go. And then it was just like, you know, a bunch of like old men, like,
1141400	1145720	talking shit to me, basically. Yeah, it's really weird. People always say like, there's no such
1145720	1149400	thing as bad press. But I don't think that I don't think the people who say that have ever got an
1149400	1157480	email, but no subject and the body of the email is just kill yourself. Several, several of these,
1158360	1163160	you know, it's like, all right, like, how did you guys sorry, how did you guys process that as a
1163160	1169480	as a couple? Like, did you was there a lot of drink and I got really sick and I'm so sick. Yeah,
1169480	1174360	I mean, I'm sure I was sick anyway, but like, whatever. I don't know. But you say yourself,
1174360	1177080	like, because this is this is something that's been happening to me over the last two days. And
1177080	1181560	I'm again, I'm used to it. And I know, I know that it takes a week for those these my horrible,
1181560	1187320	clumsy footprints to get snowed over. And I can safely go maybe take a peek into Tumblr without
1187320	1198840	seeing a photo of me looking like I just sexually assaulted a woman. The handpicked from God knows
1198840	1208040	where someone who's become ironically my biggest fan in order to find that picture. The I the weird
1208040	1213800	thing is because I don't know what's healthy and unhealthy. You're you love being on Reddit, you go
1213800	1218440	through it. And you're not you're not just read it looking for your own name and looking at your own
1218440	1222760	subreddit and things. But now you're on Reddit. And like, now you know, now all of a sudden,
1222760	1228040	this thing that's a big part of your life is like, like, I would assume or are you ghoulishly
1228040	1233320	self loathingly like scouring that stuff? I mean, there's like a certain amount of like ego that
1233320	1240040	like when 10s of 1000s of people are like looking at something that you made, there's it feels good,
1240040	1245400	even if it's like people are shitting on it. But it just makes you kind of question humanity,
1245400	1252360	like who takes the time to like, even though it's like so easy to click on the YouTube comment and
1252360	1257080	leave something shitty, but like who like actually puts that energy into it? Although I guess thinking
1257080	1263080	about it now, like I was telling you like I was like translating Russian, right? Because like someone
1263080	1266840	leaves a comment on your video and it's in Russian, you're like, I know this is gonna be bad, but I'm
1266840	1273320	still gonna Google translate. Of course, it was like something along the lines of you fucking suck.
1274360	1277800	In Russia, bad band kills you.
1283160	1289320	Well, that's another weird thing when you are scrolling through things. I know I it's the
1289320	1299240	weirdest thing, like people I will skim through people being supportive, people being kind,
1299240	1304360	people saying a nice thing. And this is under normal circumstances. Like when I when I say
1304360	1307960	something scandalous, I can't I can't really go near it. And maybe that's the healthiest thing that
1307960	1314760	habit that I've picked up because but in olden times when I was just a regular nobody that that
1315000	1319320	kind of like could was excited about maybe someone talking about me once in a while.
1320360	1326440	I like anything that I was involved in that scroll through and it's like, you know, this is great
1326440	1331800	phrases like this. This is this is so I'm part of the problem too. Like I have to be honest about
1331800	1337320	that, right? Like I even though that's a that's a thing that's only happening in in my secret part
1337320	1343160	of my brain. I'm not taking any action about that. But when when people tweet me and try to be
1343160	1349320	obnoxious and say something mean to me to get my attention. And then I say like, Hey, why don't
1349320	1356200	you go fuck yourself? You're a poop face. You're dumb. And you're wrong. And you're an idiot. And
1356200	1363000	then you're made of rubber. And your mom's an idiot. And then and then they go like, Oh,
1363000	1367640	got a rise out of you. And you're going like, Yeah, you did fuck. You still eat poop. I mean,
1367720	1373960	it's like, I take take your rise out of me and the poop that you eat and see what it adds up to. I
1373960	1377960	don't know. And they're like, Look, man, just kidding. I'm just a big fan. I just knew that
1377960	1382200	if I kissed your ass, it wouldn't be you know, like, that's not how it's like, some people say
1382200	1385880	that. Or then other people will go like, Look, you should like, like, I'm sorry. I'm just not
1385880	1394200	another sycophantic fan person. I I really want those people to die in a fire. I don't really
1394200	1400040	for the transcript. I'm just trying to put the laughs in the transcript.
1402040	1407000	That's smart. It's a transcript of a live show with an audience. Put the laughs in. That's
1407000	1419640	important. It's like reading Eminem lyrics on CNN, you know? It's just like, like, like, like,
1419720	1425000	it's always gonna sound bad, man. Like, I am I am I am not an appealing man.
1428920	1430920	Shit, shit, shit. I lost track. I lost my train of thought.
1432520	1436040	You guys don't want me to regain my train of thought, because I was on some stupid tangent
1436040	1442200	that was taking forever. You were talking about looking for the negative. Yes, good come trolling.
1442200	1447800	Yes. Yes. If I when I was doing stand up before I quit, I got if there was one person standing in
1447880	1451320	the back of the room going like this, like, I can't keep my eye off of them. I don't know.
1451320	1455320	When you guys do live gigs, do you do you pay attention to how people are reacting to you in
1455320	1459400	the back of the room? I used to. I just look at my guitar now. I mean, we've only played three
1459400	1463480	shows here in L.A., but it's been like super positive for the most part. And we're in the
1463480	1468600	Midwest. People fucking hated us. Like, people just like walk out on us. But we're like, you
1468600	1473000	know, everyone has beards and wearing flannel shirts and we're like have angel wings and leopard
1473000	1477720	print and sparkles. So I mean, it makes sense. But yeah, for the most part, it's been like super
1477720	1481480	positive. And then that was kind of the weird thing is this video is kind of like showcasing
1481480	1485800	my new band and like we're all fired up. We're like, yeah, check this out, man, happy about it.
1485800	1491080	And then we put it online where like slam, you know, yeah. Well, the cool thing is that people
1491080	1498680	had such a big reaction to it. It didn't disappear. It just it's so strange, like the like never
1499560	1505800	previously in like humanity has a person like a person or a poor little girl
1506760	1510840	like had to deal on my own. I'm not that poor. Like no one no one's ever had to deal with that
1510840	1517480	amount of like these little like I think Duncan Trussell calls them moments of novelty like these
1517480	1523800	tiny and like when they're just like constantly coming at you and it's like you cannot I don't
1523800	1529800	care who you are. You cannot stop yourself when your phone's buzzing like crazy. You cannot stop
1530360	1535880	yourself from reading it. You just can't. And so I have been able to now I just don't I just don't
1535880	1543080	go to I don't do it. But that's because I have done this five times now at least. Like I just
1543080	1550760	it's always my 40 years and counting now just like like like God telling me to say stuff.
1550760	1557560	Everyone telling me to shut up me saying but God said it and then absolutely regretting
1559320	1566440	saying that I just I'm just trying to trying to trying to say how I feel
1566440	1572120	because if I don't say anything like I'm no good to anybody and whether whether whether
1572120	1579080	whether it's typing things or saying things but like like I've been yeah anyways that's a
1579080	1586600	dumb tangent but I did want to say to you guys because I mean you're virtual strangers to me and
1587720	1591160	I just thought the story was so interesting because it kind of like it was just a
1591160	1596120	similar thing was happening to me that's like around the theme of this phenomenon which is I
1596120	1600440	don't there's no heroes or villains in the story it's just it's it's like the weather changing
1600440	1605000	it's like global warming this is a thing that's happening now we are all connected to each other
1605000	1610840	and thank God there's no FCC like channeling the whole thing through one little tiny thing
1610840	1615640	because then we'd all just be watching uh 75 year old David Hasselhoff read bedtime stories
1615640	1620440	on the internet like and and he'd still be in a scandal once in a while but he'd be
1621000	1626760	trained to handle it or whatever but but but like thank God the the gates are open and and and we're
1626760	1631640	all we're all rushing together in this big throng but just as like when you go to a you go to a
1631640	1636600	crowded like music hall and see a band that's that has a high tempo there's always some dick
1636600	1643640	in the audience that starts elbowing and you know like I I I the anonymity and the frustration of
1643640	1649160	not having control over your own life makes tiny parts of tiny individuals do these things that
1649160	1654680	when added all up create this dandruff that can choke you and make you feel ugly about everything
1654680	1660760	but but first of all there's not a single individual I truly don't believe that there's
1660760	1665640	a single whole individual out there that actually is that ugly I think that that I think we just
1665640	1672040	use the internet as a weird eyes wide shut toilet like because because we can't because it's it's
1672040	1677320	it's this syndrome it's it's because the the the more highly visible you are and by the way
1678120	1681720	like we're supposed to we're telling high school kids it gets better like are you supposed to tell
1681720	1686920	that to Rebecca Black like like like that it gets better you're gonna have 45 year old men telling
1686920	1693080	you you're a shitty singer it gets better she knows it doesn't get better hopefully it does
1693080	1698440	get better but it's like like man I'm about I'm all over the place you learned how to handle it
1698440	1707720	better you know I didn't I know I know but but but what I wanted to say to you guys is I
1707720	1712360	I clicked on your thing I watched the video I'm like oh cool song sounds like my phone's ringing
1712360	1720600	for a second awesome idea like like and then reading the comments it's like they were all so
1721160	1726040	pointless to me because I'm absolutely outside the situation there's nothing personal about
1726040	1731400	it for me like I scoured because I wanted to talk to you guys about what's the worst one like I can
1731400	1739320	see I can see that if someone's saying like like like stupid idea bad music singers ugly
1739560	1751400	uh voice and face uh yeah uh turn your hat around uh stop singing forever and cut yourself
1751400	1759240	and your face and it'll look better because your face is worse than a cut face like to to you it's
1759240	1765000	like it like I can say that and they can laugh because they know it's a joke and I know it's a
1765960	1771160	a joke too that's like like like like like those those concepts you're seeing it from some
1771160	1777480	anonymous stranger and the only difference is you're projecting onto it like like oh
1777480	1782040	shit like like what if they really mean that and it's like they don't they just they're just
1782040	1787240	they're just in a sad part of their life like like just having some weird moment of weakness
1787240	1792520	and and and they don't none of it's true none of it means anything they're literally trying to
1792520	1797320	make you feel exactly how you feel it's almost an uplifting thing about that yeah it's still
1797320	1802760	possible for us to touch each other just we're just we're just doing it there's just we're using
1802760	1814760	glory holes to put we're putting spears through them it's it's a misuse of the technology like
1814760	1819240	it's clear what you what we should be doing and how we could all benefit
1826360	1830440	there's like there's multiple levels though of how how fucked up it is though because like
1830440	1835080	I mean once you've had I mean once you've like read like literally thousands and thousands
1835080	1841720	of people like telling you to kill yourself like you you now every time you read one it's like okay
1841720	1846920	yeah whatever but then sometimes you like click the user and see you actually see the person and
1846920	1851960	now like youtube shows like a photo a lot of times and but that that's the part that kind of
1851960	1859000	upsets me because then I see the person and I'm like whoa like that is a human being and they
1859000	1864360	in their free time are shitting on something that I'm doing for fun with my friends but you know the
1864360	1868040	great thing about that is you can further click on them and see the comments they're leaving and
1868040	1872360	and you can see the mental state that they're in well that's yeah like we've so we like picked a
1872360	1876920	couple of them out and we're just like wow they're doing it at least it's not just me but I don't know
1876920	1881960	you showed me because I was upset yeah I mean it's like when you're like any type of creative
1881960	1887880	profession like as you know like the last thing you need is someone saying stop because everyone
1887880	1892040	along the way in our lives has said you don't need and everything in your head says stop because
1892040	1897640	you don't need another reason to be more critical of yourself yeah exactly well you guys do me a huge
1897640	1903720	huge favor and and all of society a huge favor and use the emotional experience of being told
1903720	1909960	to stop by people that don't really mean stop uh to create more songs about how it feels to be told
1909960	1918120	to stop or something because if enough of us start doing that if enough of us make humanity boring
1918120	1923880	enough to other people like like well we maybe with the parts of us that hate ourselves I think
1923960	1928680	that I think that a lot of us have to have to get up in the morning and go to bed at night never
1928680	1934280	having told the truth I say and I think that that it's a lot of times it's not their fault either
1934280	1938920	and I think that you guys and me like we're in the unique position to be able to you know we can
1938920	1943720	tell the truth about how we feel and just say weird shit and let the chips fall where they may
1943720	1950200	and we we kind of have to keep doing it so otherwise like if we stop then then uh then 9-11
1950200	1960840	happens again and you can quote me on that vulture.com uh do you guys have anything to
1960840	1964120	promote or anything you want anyone to know about anything you're doing you're you're you're just

2260040	2267720	couldn't because it was as you said a two-man job so I guess I'm sometimes pretty manly
2267720	2276760	yeah I'm as manly as two men by your definition I did a two-man job I was I was really impressed
2276760	2281560	by that also really impressed by the doggy gate that you put at the top of the stairs thank you
2281560	2287240	yeah I think there's a big sheet of instructions that came with that it was like did you did you
2287240	2293320	look at them or did you yeah of course no I followed them you know first I issued a press
2293320	2297400	release about how the company that made the doggy gate was a bunch of blood sucking rich assholes
2298120	2304200	uh but then one of them emailed me and said his feelings were hurt so I uh I installed the doggy
2304200	2311240	gate I eventually do what I'm supposed to do and and humanity benefits I like that I like
2311240	2314840	that you read the directions I've had a couple handyman over to the house when you haven't been

2560040	2566520	guys yeah uh they were they were I was talking to them for a while and then people were gathered
2566520	2571080	around us and uh they walked away after a while you know it's like conversations kind of ebb and
2571080	2576200	flow they they they left the conversation circle and I was stuck with like like some other people
2576200	2581560	and and and this one guy just like really enamored with me and kept asking started asking
2581560	2587000	me more and more specific questions about about when I shoot like stuff like like what I'm thinking
2587000	2591480	and I was like really flattered by it and like wow you know I just try hey at the end of the day
2591480	2597720	it's just stuff you know and and then then he started asking about New Zealand and oh no
2597720	2606360	and I and I went like I've never been to New Zealand and he went like yeah you have and you
2606360	2615560	have an American accent like like so many clues and I and I and and he he went like you've never
2615560	2621240	been to New Zealand and I said no and then he looked and his face like contorted into anger
2621960	2628680	I felt at me anger at me pointed at the at the giggling work workaholic guys on the other side
2628680	2638040	of the party I said those guys told me you were Peter Jackson which is I mean I'm not usually a
2638040	2644040	fan of practical joke humor that's a good one that's funny shit man I will forever remember them
2644040	2651400	yeah the uh the furniture thing uh I have I'm like not handy at all also but I have this thing
2651400	2656920	like if I get started on something Emily is not handy either so we both are not handy I'm not
2656920	2662040	gonna hurt anyone no no no I was gonna whatever that what's it something rabbits what are they
2662040	2667800	called the people that come and fix it the jolts and the chads of the world yes Joel Chad Nick
2668440	2673160	so I I got this we got this awesome desk and put it together and I was like I'm gonna
2673160	2679640	fucking finish this today and I got so like worked up trying to finish this this is completely
2679640	2686360	true Emily walked in two hours later and I was completely naked sweating from everywhere
2687240	2688840	just like punching a board
2691400	2697240	because I got so I'm like I'm physically bigger than it I should be able to have power over it
2697240	2704680	right I did that I was I did that too I was trying to move a chair through a door and that's
2704680	2708520	why I got in this big oh my god that's a two-man job you need to take that door off that's a
2708520	2712920	two-man job and it was like you know I just got that's like you're like uh you know practically
2712920	2717240	naked too because yeah you're sweating and you just I was like one thing I can't control stupid
2717240	2723560	clothes yeah yeah you're like do you two-man job is like Marty McFly's chicken you know
2723560	2729240	like if you hear two-man job god damn it can I tell you this is eating away at me okay
2730760	2736600	oh my god I took the closet door off the hinges it was lighter and easier to get off
2736600	2739000	I it was a two-man job the door that you said
2742280	2747320	I figured out a different door I could take off that was not a not so much a two-man job
2747320	2754440	but the principle of the thing is you know what believe in me yeah
2756680	2761000	you know what I guess turns out coming clean is a one-man job
2766360	2772120	I was I was I was literally about to say he he moved a very heavy door and put it back on
2772120	2776680	its hinges perfectly which is amazing that's slightly lighter but you know what he figured
2776680	2783160	out how to get around it and isn't that just as important there's going to be the guy with the
2783160	2787880	eye patch that's creepy and has like fish tanks full of heads and stuff well you want to stick
2787880	2793960	with the old who am I and I think I'm the old man that lost his leg yep I have something to say
2793960	2801960	about the handyman Nick and John I have something to tell you about all those nanny cams
2801960	2811560	what that's why we're getting free labor this whole thing everyone's winning everyone's winning
2812440	2817240	I was gonna say it so you guys were talking about like feedback online and I've talked about how
2817240	2821480	like I always get like racist stuff on Twitter and the thing that a lot of people say I think
2821480	2827080	I've mentioned it here people say like go back to India and I always say I've never been there I'm
2827080	2836840	not Indian are you just wishing like an awesome vacation for me but this one I want to read this
2836840	2841640	one tweet I got yesterday because I was tweeting about Paul I'm sorry why did they want you to go
2841640	2848600	back to India do they want your job that you're taking like what are you are you welding cars
2849400	2854360	if I say anything political they'll be like go back to India okay so yesterday I was tweeting
2854360	2860200	about Paula Deen well just from my picture they were like all right that's what an Indian guy
2860200	2866520	looks like that is what it is I'm very easily google-able there's not many other kamala jiannis
2866520	2872920	who are from India to like confuse them just I'm just saying if you're being racist fucking be
2872920	2878040	accurate yeah I mean yeah like but I got this one because I was tweeting about Paula Deenie
2878040	2883880	yesterday because I think I genuinely think she's a bad person I want to read this because it's such
2883880	2890600	it's the most densely racist thing that I've ever read in so few letters this is what he says
2890600	2896440	so I was tweeting about her being racist and he says unfortunate but every race has rampant racism
2896440	2902600	permeating their cultures now this sentence is my favorite this is what he says Indians are very
2902600	2910200	racist to others I'll tell you why I love this one he calls me Indian when I'm Pakistani so
2910200	2917000	already the first word he's already racist also if the purest form of racism is is attributing a
2917000	2923640	characteristic to a race because of because there are certain race so him saying Indians are very
2923640	2933000	racist to others he's being purely racist while using the word racist it's like a mobius strip
2933000	2940840	of racism he's the Charlie Kaufman of racism yeah it's so good I do think a lot of a lot
2940840	2946920	of problems could be solved if maybe if if we just decide whether it's true or not but let's
2946920	2955080	just break the cycle and just say okay what white people are are more racist genetically
2956840	2960840	like like like I just stopped the conversation just go okay all right all right we found the
2960840	2966760	problem yeah like white people have a gene for racism and then we can all go oh because even if
2966760	2973160	that's not true we can use that as an excuse to just like stop the cycle like the weird spiraling
2973160	2978120	argument because it's you know the problem is like a 14 year old white girl like like like in
2978120	2983960	line at the mall that has some weird culture clash moment um you know she's she's 14 she
2983960	2989240	doesn't she doesn't she doesn't have the geopolitical fucking backbone to like and the
2989240	2993720	experience to deal with all this stuff she's going to say something equally like weird and
2993720	2997640	stuff but she's white so she's going to say something horribly racist in defense of her
2997640	3003400	ego which all 14 year olds have yeah so like if we all just like like passed a law that said okay
3003400	3007320	we decided we found it we found the racist gene white people have it and you're gonna be like
3007320	3013640	that's our struggle white people struggle yeah it's hard it's hard to be racist and then we have
3014440	3018120	you're gonna be like it's like your sickle cell anemia see we're doing it again
3019480	3024760	you get it yes like like it would all solve itself you know how you smell like curry see
3024760	3030520	we can't help it because you know what we're doing right now we're doing almost the opposite
3030520	3035800	with the the the diversity movement and please don't misinterpret this like i i think like for
3035800	3040760	instance nbc's diversity program i've said many many i get so many emails from them and i never
3040760	3045720	signed up for it i don't know how this happened it's it's it's it's it's it's okay like i think
3045720	3051640	that pro-action in a in a climate where obviously there is a long-standing momentum of things not
3051640	3056600	getting done i think i don't think that scientifically this thing's better than the other but i think
3056600	3061560	doing anything at all is better than doing nothing and so i i want to be very clear about that i'm
3061560	3066200	not one of these people that's like affirmative action is reverse racism it's dumb dumb dumb
3066920	3071000	uh but i just want to point out one because you're not saying affirmative action is dumb
3071000	3076440	you're saying that saying that is dumb yes did i oh god thank you for being here thank you
3076440	3081720	can you just walk around with me it would be like i was gonna say in a backpack but then
3081720	3087880	people would go yeah dan harman tells a pakistani guy to be in his backpack here's here's the
3087880	3096040	transcript yeah he gave me three wishes i i wish for a thousand pakistanis
3098440	3104760	that's our that's my white gene i'm in scrupulous because i could see the quote from that would be
3104760	3110840	affirmative action ellipses dumb dumb dumb yeah yeah of course no no no that's i know i'm not one
3110840	3119080	of those those libertarian kind of white guys that's like like like i don't think that spark
3119080	3127800	like logic in the face of a huge legacy uh and momentum of of disproportionality in certain uh
3127800	3133560	job spaces is the solution i think that that some of the solutions are not going to be logical
3133560	3138120	they're going to be like everybody stand on this side of the boat like to to try to counteract
3138120	3143800	some of this stuff uh so that being said i just i wanted to have the what make the koi qt
3143800	3150440	observation that i think the driving force behind the concept of diversity like the diversity
3150440	3157000	movement if you could call it that like like like is is it me or is there like is is is there a way
3157000	3161960	to interpret all of this like a subtle implication is that only white people have the power to end
3161960	3168520	racism well i mean here's why that is sort of a thing that's implied is because white people
3168520	3174440	because racism is all about um at all bigotry it's about sort of power differentials right
3174440	3181160	and so uh if that's why you know like uh a black person being racist against a white person is not
3181160	3185240	as harmful really as a white person being racist against a black person because white people have
3185240	3193320	power so because white people in america have the power uh that's why it's usually sort of not
3193320	3199560	the job of white people but they're the ones who i think in effect the most change yeah exactly yeah
3199560	3204360	and right now it's like it's like a little in the absence of just saying yeah i maybe it's cartoonish
3204360	3208920	i'm probably not being serious but honestly if if if some scientist if a scientist can pretend that
3208920	3215400	brontosaurus has existed man it's just like like one scientist going i found the racism gene i found
3215400	3223720	a gene in the caucasoid bloodstream yeah it just it makes you just a tad more racist so you in order
3223720	3230360	to counteract it you have to you have to force your your your poor poor racist white blood
3230920	3235800	to to be a little less racist uh it's it's a struggle that you have yeah i'm beating a dead
3235800	3242360	horse but all right i think that's good i like that idea we should get one guy have proof and
3242360	3250840	then his lab burns down and he dies and he's the sacrifice yeah for ending racism yeah yeah this
3250840	3255320	would be a great like yeah pelican brief kind of he's done it thanks for coming to hermitown all
3255320	3261560	right let's let's let's play what's this game yeah i'm excited what's this game aaron has a gene for
3261560	3271480	game playing uh can i bring uh spencer to the stage please spencer spencer
3278200	3284520	hailing from the city near los angeles spencers favorite time is bedtime what
3285240	3293160	that timing was perfect uh amazing all right so we're gonna play we're gonna play a little game
3293160	3299800	it's going to be dan against kumail and uh it's not necessary to this game but it may enhance it
3299800	3305080	can i have adam goldberg come to the stage wait his presence is gonna enhance controversial
3306040	3307400	now i've heard everything
3312840	3318280	how's it going how do you do it adam thank you thank you adam uh i always want to not you know
3318280	3323880	and then you say something nice i'm like all right thanks yeah so this last week was uh spencer's
3323880	3332760	first week as your assistant all right yeah which i know and he's amazing he's great yeah i've heard
3332840	3337080	but i've heard from uh from both sides that it's going really well spencer is having a great time
3337080	3343800	and and spencer's doing great and uh spencer sits in the writer's room uh and it stares at me like a
3343800	3352440	falcon and uh and and i i at one point i needed to sit down two times as this happened yeah too
3352440	3355960	because i'm standing there talking to the writers a huge writing staff this year because we
3356760	3361960	i i was like there's no chair and i kind of i became conscious of my need for my fat butt to be
3362600	3368680	supported by something and this viking man bounded up with a heavy chair and plopped it down the
3368680	3376200	writers were really impressed they applauded yeah they did they applauded that's that's that's
3376200	3382680	that's assisting someone when you get applause for it so it sounds like spencer knows you very well
3382680	3388680	and is anticipating your whims but how well do you know spencer we're gonna play a little game no
3392520	3399000	we're in my world man we're gonna play a little and and adam uh for those of you who don't know
3399000	3402120	if you're just listening to this podcast for the first time or if you're here from variety
3402120	3410360	or the hollywood reporter adam goldberg is a controversial harm in town audience member uh
3410360	3416520	tenacious lightning lightning lightning rod lightning rod is weird because it's not the
3416520	3418280	rod's fault that it's happening
3422280	3424600	the rod is not bringing it upon itself
3427560	3432760	the man like this game is this game i really don't like when other men refer to me as the rod
3433720	3434840	whatever so we're gonna
3438120	3444600	we're going to play a little game called spencer or adam oh boy all right
3447480	3450520	all right i will just say there was a guy when we were handing out cupcakes there was a guy
3450520	3455880	that was so obviously a entertainment blogger that had never been here before like there's
3455880	3460440	this guy that just had this look i'm really curious if he was or if he's just oh tonight
3460440	3464680	yeah it's just like it just looks so out of place and was so like like like just just
3464680	3468360	camping out here like like well you know hey superman that's something i like
3468600	3469160	huh
3473880	3482360	all right okay so uh this is i asked both spencer and adam the same series of questions
3483160	3487400	and what i'm going to do is i'm going to uh present a question and the answer
3487400	3493080	and kamil and dan you're going to say if it's spencer or if it's adam this feels like it should
3493080	3501160	be the easiest game of all time but i bet it's not gonna be we'll see all right uh so let's go
3501160	3507720	ahead and uh begin the game will be done when it feels right for it to be over we're out here
3508840	3516040	and uh adam and spencer try to uh contain yourselves um yeah why are we necessary for this
3516680	3525000	like to be well as a as a as a visual so people can see yeah visual for the podcast so they are
3525000	3532040	you're the fan of white for the for the live audience spencer quotes and then have it be
3532040	3537400	spencer or spencer what all right i'll be back i'll be back in a half hour yeah we don't need
3537400	3544200	the visual thank you for uh okay see you once let's uh go ahead and begin and it's not it's
3544200	3549000	not timed you guys can talk it out and then give me your final are we we're finding against each
3549000	3558200	other yes okay first question when asked what is your biggest fear who said being trapped underground
3558200	3569000	for reals biggest fear who said being trapped underground for real i think i know i my guest
3569000	3573720	would be spencer because it sounds like something spencer would say also because i truly believe
3573720	3581000	adam is without fear
3584760	3586040	that's not a compliment
3588680	3590360	sociopaths have no fear
3593720	3599880	lightning strikes again i mean i agree absolutely i know i know that spencer
3599880	3606040	uses that colloquial apostrophe instead of a g kind of talking the idea that he typed it is very
3606040	3615080	charming all right being trapped underground for reals he does have falcony qualities you're right
3616120	3621800	there's something very graceful about you thank you yeah uh that is a compliment
3622600	3629880	uh the correct answer was actually adam no you you read a how-to guide on how to
3630760	3632680	present as human and then
3635000	3639080	humans die right i live in my castle forever but that one will get them
3641560	3649720	all right he's a he's a worthy or adverse adversary than we had anticipated okay next
3649720	3656680	question i confuse my visa w sometimes next question uh when asked to describe an embarrassing
3656680	3661960	moment from his childhood who said i called a lady fat she was fat
3665480	3669480	when asked to describe an embarrassing moment from his childhood who said i called a lady fat
3669480	3677560	she was fat again my guest would be spencer me too yeah because adam clearly does not get
3677560	3684440	embarrassed now she was fat no no he's no no wait what's going on what's your guess no no he's
3686440	3687960	that is correct it was spencer
3692600	3697560	i'm batting 100 so far uh next question when when asked
3700280	3703880	when asked you can eat three things for the rest of your life what are they
3704840	3709800	who said potatoes rice and the souls of the unsullied
3720200	3724200	okay i'm gonna give you all right i'm sorry could you read those half credit
3725800	3732600	the three things were potatoes rice pizza who for the rest of his life will only eat potatoes
3733320	3735480	rice pizza
3737320	3743320	well i mean i i'm gonna go spencer again because i know adam's response to that question would be
3743320	3750280	more complicated i think adam would go would say well i have a rare form of anemia that requires
3750280	3755000	that i have insulin you know he would i don't know something it would be circuitous of all
3755000	3761000	the things you accuse me of diabetes i didn't mean it's on the long list but i did not see
3761560	3766120	i just assume your diet is complicated or that even if it wasn't like that you would
3766120	3772120	yeah that i i could see spencers being a simple simple simple child who just wants to bulk up
3772120	3778920	you know what you know i love rice pizza and uh first of all who doesn't um but i feel like part
3778920	3785240	of spencer's appeal is that he uh can sort of i really feel like there's something about you
3785240	3793320	that is uh above us but that's a compliment but also your ability to sort of connect with
3793320	3800360	regular normal humans and this is all a compliment by the way you once said you could have a religion
3800360	3809800	spencer um so i will go with spencer too that is correct it was spencer what would your answer have
3809880	3815480	been adam i i was considering a real answer about the how you can make a lot of cuisine
3815480	3820760	with the same three foods exactly yeah wait yeah can you tell us the other answer you can read my
3820760	3827400	joke answer adam said uh dwindling fat rapidly which fits the context of the question rewind
3827400	3833320	the podcast and put my answer and the question together it's pretty funny it's a good one i nailed
3834280	3838920	it check that out rewind enjoy that laugh privately
3844360	3849640	adam has all this overlap with spencer like they're both i would say they're both above yeah uh
3850280	3854120	but but but there's a like i don't know what the difference is but like adam's
3854120	3859320	adam's jokes like they're they rhythmically they never they land on the downbeat yeah
3859480	3866760	and then everyone's like you can't dance to it yeah it's like it's like trying to watch
3866760	3874520	edward scissor hands shake hands you know like he doesn't have the tools but if you but if when
3874520	3878360	you listen to anything that he says like if you listen very funny that interview that he did with
3878360	3884600	the the podcast cast and stuff like that like like adam's like you know he's no he's i'm out
3884600	3889000	of sync with this plane of existence
3894200	3898600	okay next question can i ask what was why were you counting what was going on i was trying to
3898600	3906040	get to the rhythm i was one two three yeah i do think it would have been him slowing himself
3906040	3912120	down in some unnatural way which is unfair it was very appealing for some reason i don't know why i
3912120	3916920	like that all right next question daisy daisy
3921000	3926760	i'm about we gotta go into adam's brain and like like slide out those like 2001 i'm sorry i can't
3926760	3938600	do that damn uh thanks for doing this adam uh all right uh next i asked uh both gentlemen
3939240	3942280	uh you were just given a yacht what do you name it
3945000	3949560	this was good erin you did good oh you know how much i need that
3950440	3957160	well and you know how much i'd never give people what they need i i i the more they need it the
3957160	3961160	more i don't want to give it to them so i really you know you know i really feel you did a good
3961240	3964440	job of this game this game this game has no winners
3968120	3972600	it's it's becoming clear that this game just has a loser and it's not anyone who's playing
3972600	3977400	thank god i thought that by the start of that sentence no you're not playing i know
3977400	3984920	she is talking about you oh i'm joking well this no they gave you a tv show
3985880	3991240	that's approaching my heart that accent was on the downbeat no adam's adam's answers are great
3991240	3996200	i didn't i'm not i'm not i'm not great that is very smart okay yeah let's keep going who said
3996200	4002200	when asked what he would name his yacht i love this carl rove
4002200	4018120	when asked what he would name his yacht who said carl rove uh i i i i think that spencer knows who
4018120	4025800	carl rove is but i don't think he cares uh i think i think adam maybe is would be the one to try to
4025800	4033720	make some point with naming his yacht ditto i i feel like we're thinking exactly the same on all of
4033720	4041320	these well that's yeah all right can you tell us what the other answer was oh i can do that uh
4041320	4050200	the other answer was the uss hubris the uss shit hubris
4054040	4062120	i mean that's that's what i named mine by the way so whoever said that should really uh be proud
4062120	4070440	of themselves i'm guessing you're you're hubris and he's rove correct adam
4074360	4082440	so what were the final well we we we both thought that carl rove was spencer carl rove wow why why
4082440	4089880	it's like the same title what do you mean it was uss hubris oh you just it's just like a rich guy's
4089880	4096840	name yeah yeah it's like a symbol of you know power and access over others which is what a yacht
4096840	4102840	is yeah that's what i mean it's it's like yeah you should come out to carl rove it's funny
4105720	4110760	let's go uh let's go get drunk on carl rove yeah it's like he's chained on the third dock or
4110760	4118280	whatever i don't know i don't have carl rove uh we're gonna take carl rove out and do some e
4121720	4127080	Kanye's coming it's a great name it's a great name yeah new year's eve let's go inside carl rove and
4129960	4131080	all right next question
4131080	4138920	okay let him finish fuck all right continue
4140760	4146760	i asked both gentlemen if you could date any celebrity who would it be and why who said
4147640	4150360	jake jill and hall it would prove a theory of mine
4150360	4171240	i mean i that's that's that's gotta be adam uh yeah for sure and again it's it's really funny
4171240	4177640	it's very funny but it's funnier because she read it no well well no the point if i was reading no
4177640	4182280	i know i'm saying it's great but it's funny in print i mean that's yeah it's great you are
4182280	4190520	correct that was adam adam i was here adam what is your theory jake jill and hall is gay
4195000	4201080	i like that in your head just him being gay is enough for him to want to have sex with you
4201080	4210440	well no you gotta get tired of people coming at some point the question is if you could what was
4210440	4217800	it date or marry right well in either case the question grants the answer god power sure so yeah
4217800	4222920	i think the funny thing is that he would waste that power to be right about one thing about a
4222920	4227640	celebrity there were there were more questions about dating i mean erin made the quiz and it's
4227640	4236360	very emotional romantic and emotional and me slurring those words that is true he doesn't want
4236360	4241720	to use the power to have sex with somebody wants to have sex with he wants to prove he's right
4242680	4243240	gotcha
4245480	4252520	u.s u.s college friend steve and go told you i would love it so much if this actually happened
4252520	4258760	in real life it would be the greatest day of my life of your life and jake's life and jake's life
4260840	4265640	the best pilot in the world single camera pilot would be adam goldberg getting like doing like a
4265640	4272280	reboot of greatest american hero where adam goldberg gets the super suit and he's just a superhero but
4272280	4275960	he doesn't know he just really has these powers and they're just like watching how he would use him
4276120	4284360	i'll say it would be like kind of awesome that he rescued you but then also like yeah yeah sorry
4284360	4290600	yeah the other guys no that was the suit you're feeling the suit that's the suit that's the suit
4290600	4298920	i asked both adam and spencer if you could be any animal in the world for 24 hours
4299880	4302280	24 hours
4303880	4311560	which animal would you be and why who said some sort of a cool bird or jungle cat
4313640	4320920	who said some sort of a cool bird or jungle cat those are like that's a wide response
4322200	4328680	can i re ask real quick who spencer wanted to have sex with what was his response i want to know too
4328760	4335320	i passed well he passed what why you could have chosen because i just looked at this email and
4335320	4340040	just shout out a bunch of answers he also sent me an email saying if this is some sort of secret
4340040	4346440	dating thing i'm not into it i'm on to you i got my on you didn't tell him why they're asking
4346440	4350840	questions i said i'm comfortable and can you answer these questions yeah i thought that was a cover
4352520	4356120	like i was going to scour the audience like oh this look good to you
4356680	4362280	yeah you never do anything like that anyone that listens to your podcast knows you'd never like
4362280	4367640	just play matchmaker that'd be weird carry up front about that i would say jungle cat of birds i
4367640	4374920	would say it's spencer because first i said you have falcony qualities about you and also jungle
4374920	4381880	cat equality is about you and also while we were all doing like the spencer voice he in the spencer
4381880	4390920	voice said jungle cat or bird so uh he knows it spencer and i think wow i i unfortunately i agree
4390920	4398120	too as i have every time with you're correct that was spencer adam said uh does the animal die i
4398120	4404120	could fit a bird day into my schedule i thought spencer's answer would be a human being
4404120	4413560	or something like how many hit dice does it have something that's valuable i know how many hit dice
4413560	4425320	it has can't win and i know how much damage my katana does any ladies in the audience i get
4425320	4436680	aroused when i heard that uh dice line yep resounding yep back to minneapolis
4437880	4441080	don't you worry spencer i'll get you married i said i'd have none of this
4443400	4452360	spencer you could parlay your notoriety into so much specifically you and no one else
4452360	4459320	might think that no you have no idea you have like uh oh my god so many but he'd have to not
4459320	4466600	be himself i know yeah that's what's great he'd have to go for being a spencer that was adored by
4467160	4473320	people to he'd have to cross that all-important line to being a guy that what kind of creep does
4473320	4480040	this uh and the answer is many uh guy like oh so you enjoy watching me do that thing well uh
4480840	4487160	any way to get some pussy out of this like it's like it's a hard line for a gentleman to cross
4487160	4492280	but it's also here's the thing is that it's not just she's getting something out of it too she's
4492280	4497480	getting to have sex with spencer it goes both ways but i mean you're not taking advantage of them
4497480	4502280	but the same thing that's making him adorable makes it hard to talk to it's like people are
4502280	4507480	adoring the fact that finally on display is a personality that's very resonant which is someone
4507480	4513320	who doesn't normally you know doesn't do that freaking tango in a one-on-one interaction my
4513320	4521880	theory is that spencer is secretly dating someone famous like pal abdul i'd i'd like to live in how
4521880	4533560	kumil perceives me that's amazing i'd shoot lasers and yeah shit kittens and they'd still be enjoyable
4533560	4539880	i say i get it because i watch the documentary footage so i've seen i've seen footage of you
4539880	4544680	interacting with women after shows on tour did you see him introducing me to their boyfriends
4546280	4552280	no no i've seen i've that's good editing i've seen i've seen a handful of cute girls come up
4552280	4558760	to you get you to sign stuff and and be just as nervous as you are and like kind of lingering and
4558760	4564840	hanging out and and part the the the fratty part of my brain would you know wants to go like oh hit
4564840	4571320	on her but it's like then you wouldn't be spencer like and and she also it's like you're not you're
4571320	4576440	not you know yeah i don't know yeah it's uh it's uh like i have a i have a weird love-hate relationship
4576440	4583720	with this idea of like uh you know wow spencer you should you should smash the puss i for one
4583720	4589400	i'm totally over over it you're over what i'm over i'm over the matchmaking for spencer because
4589400	4594200	he's punished me even when i'm not asking for it it's a whole it's a big inner friendship why don't
4594200	4599640	you try and help adam i could fit a bird day into my schedule
4605000	4611240	that was great i also don't think it's like i i don't i don't think spencer necessarily needs
4611320	4615000	a girlfriend i think if someone's autonomous and happy they don't need to be with anybody
4616120	4621880	everybody likes to have sex well i i think that spencer i think that spencer has sex you're right
4621880	4628200	i think dispenserness of of him would not be there he's right next to you i'm barely autonomous or
4628200	4638360	happy only a few only a few more questions if not uh one or two when asked we're having a good time
4638360	4645720	up here yeah that's the four of us i'm having no it's time if there were a holiday in your honor
4645720	4650120	what would it celebrate who said courage
4658280	4660280	if you're in your holiday i don't know
4661160	4665000	uh what would it celebrate who said courage
4668280	4675720	why would i say the name of my firstborn uh i mean i'll i i'll just go adam because
4675720	4681240	because i think he and you you see yourself as very brave i think not that you're not like you
4681240	4685240	say he doesn't have fear you said he doesn't have fear you are without fear yeah and look
4685240	4689400	at look what he tolerates up here yeah i know it's great the man with no backbone
4689960	4693480	adam in fact said my birth it was spencer who said
4696200	4701640	can i can i explain my answer i thought i at some point i was like i should answer
4701640	4703480	things that people might think adam would say
4707400	4708600	wish i said courage
4708600	4715080	i wrote when i wrote my birth i was trying to write an answer spencer might say
4715080	4720440	i was yeah i was gonna write i was gonna write my myself and then i changed it to courage
4721080	4725400	this is amazing you guys are trying to be each other and very accurate you should have read
4725400	4732040	the whole questionnaire yeah when asked what punctuation mark best describes your personality
4732040	4735560	who said in ellipses and who said an interrobang
4737800	4743960	when asked what punctuation mark best describes your personality interrobang i heard all that
4743960	4747240	i just never wanted an interrobang it's question mark exclamation question mark
4747240	4750440	exclamation that thing you know that people do like how is this happening
4754440	4761080	it's alternating question marks and exclamation marks to get like uh let me use it can it be one
4761080	4765080	pairing of them yeah yeah is that still an interrobang yeah you see it a lot on you know
4765080	4770440	online writing it's not like a proper it'll be like uh but it's not like beetle bailey swearing
4770440	4777000	it's not like like no no no that is called grollix those weird like symbols those are called
4777000	4782680	grollix do you listen to wait wait don't tell me only one that's like an answer on that

4796360	4800680	doing an impression of the other guy i don't know yeah i don't know if that's true
4804680	4810440	uh i'll go i'll i'll say that uh spencer did the interrobang no no no i mean if he was going to
4810440	4817240	answer honestly i guess he'd be an ellipses spencer spencer would be an ellipse thoughtful
4817240	4824360	hidden reserve like timing is king for spencer he's very very restrained yeah
4825160	4831480	adam as we know is just everyone's reaction to him isn't he's up on stage again
4833960	4839880	he's he's he's he's like marmaduke can i say something a large a successful movie
4839880	4846520	it's just that was great movie no marmaduke movie yeah yeah yeah um you know what i'm sorry
4846520	4850600	this is not going to play on the podcast or even to people here but the fact that your toenails
4850600	4858680	exactly match that guy's shoe color is i cannot i'm like staring at your toes do they know each
4858680	4862120	other do you guys know each other isn't that crazy because it's not a standard color

4870600	4875960	that's right i describe stuff for a living i mean i don't make a living off of it
4875960	4882280	speaking of which all right oh wait so i'll say interrobang is um what did you said he's
4882280	4886840	ellipses yeah that's the accurate and i'll say the same thing unless they're trying to be each
4886840	4893560	other well you're right spencer was ellipses and adam was interrobang final question all right
4893560	4899160	now we're we're tied i'm assuming it's me you are so let's let's let's let's yeah we'll we'll go

5282280	5285160	i'm having a great out here i'm loving it i'm loving life
5296280	5303000	when we last met our heroes had just finished mastering the basics of their seasonal armlets
5303000	5308520	and after discussing their new abilities the gang decided to free sharpie's father from the demon
5308520	5314040	occupied yellow camp christa berg became invisible and then attacked one of the demonic
5314040	5322840	taskmasters and mole rain put a sack on top of a bedroll and then nothing else happened
5324920	5331480	i stacked ice for a little while and didn't really pay attention to the topics that's all
5332440	5334680	all right so i made though that's everyone
5337720	5341880	you can't even make people clap for spencer spencer can't even make people clap
5344680	5347000	does that what he said spencer everyone i was wondering what he said
5348600	5351320	and everyone was like we love spencer but ack says it
5352680	5355240	something as basic as his abracadabra
5355240	5359560	and the rabbit falls out the bottom of the hat
5361240	5363720	and dies yeah but where did the hat come from

5374680	5381320	we love spencer their hands are tied from applauding uh i made the executive decision
5382040	5386120	a random decision to have because you're controlling you're playing quark you're
5386120	5393320	playing jeff davis's character erin and then uh so adam is playing mole rain all right
5394600	5400120	i don't know it just made sense to me but all right yeah so last week kumail my dad was
5400120	5405000	playing your character and he used your ability to turn invisible and stab the crap out of a demon

5519000	5529160	a magical manner you lose forth several bolts of fiery bolts dealing 17 damage to the lead demon

5539640	5545160	him in the back he flips about and smacks you with uh his whip but not the end of it just kind
5545160	5550600	of the handle of his whip kind of like a pistol whip like a whip a whip whip yeah like a whip whip

5628200	5635640	how i've uh been in awe of you our entire adventure and it also explains this this this
5635640	5642840	deep connection that i believe we have and i i want us to form an alliance if that's possible
5642840	5649560	mole rain if you'll have me mole rain considers this mole rain remembers coming back to the woods
5649560	5657080	several planes ago and finding you uh hip deep inside her most beloved uh friend coco and then
5657080	5662920	says wait i can't control it why not buddy i'm only good at one thing no that's it you can't
5662920	5667080	you can't you can't counter my internal monologue i just mole rain has a kind of grin on our face
5667080	5672120	it says yeah my best friend devo adventure
5677720	5684440	they saw you doing my face no i was doing what the caricature of my face is okay all right okay
5684440	5690440	all right all right well i give you this water skin and then uh and then i um i see that cork
5690440	5696120	has a power bracelet uh yeah it increases the strength okay i put on my little power bracelet
5696120	5706840	okay um and i see that that i have ghost sound yes um can i throw the ghost sound on the other
5706840	5714520	side of can you blame it on the dog how does can i can i do the ghost sound and then take my
5715160	5719640	knives and throw them at the bad guy you can't do both you have to pick one all right i'll throw
5719640	5726040	my knives all right but i'm making the ghost sound in my heart in your heart is that like
5726040	5731400	a ventriloquism thing is that what the ghost sound is you can throw your voice it's it's a minor uh
5731400	5735960	sound based illusion so you can look like a dog barking or like a rustling or twig snapping
5735960	5743000	anyway we're actually throwing knives here but uh with the ghost sound in your heart you lose
5743000	5753720	fourth a dagger from your pack and it hits critically so ha ha deals that's three plus
5754760	5762520	seven damage all right i wink at moraine as to say this is the beginning this is the new beginning
5762520	5767080	all right yeah use your strength to throw knives i'm gonna duck in there get on the other side
5767080	5773080	of a christoper and just start slashing at it with my sword the fact i'm distracting the demon
5773080	5779000	will allow you to sneak attack it and uh get some shots in i mean be careful all right right no no
5779000	5785240	i got your back buddy yeah hey uh what's your attack bonus room i uh i am at plus eight
5785240	5790600	at one g eight crit is times three that's pretty good but not enough to hit unfortunately all right
5790600	5795960	you do manage to menace the demon and he's kind of occupied touching your blues you won't defeat
5796040	5803560	the four seasons so easily if you talk it gives away your position no it's like i'm drawing
5803560	5808520	attention to you so you can sell them in the back great yeah of course all right so while he is
5808520	5817080	sacrificing himself very courageously i take out uh what's my strongest weapon that i have
5817640	5821720	a poison dagger yeah probably that oh yeah i go to town
5825160	5831800	i'm like puncturing lungs and shit going to town puncturing lungs and lungs and shit
5831800	5835080	you plunge your blade deep into the demonic heart of the demon
5837880	5838760	that's what they have
5838760	5847960	dealing tend yeah all right the demon clutches his demon heart falls to the ground before
5847960	5852920	dissolving into a black powder and i point to him the way they're doing basketball to the whoever
5852920	5855880	passed the assistant back point it back
5864280	5866120	could have been you cork could have been you
5866200	5870680	you're standing amongst like a bunch of chained slaves at this point they look at you now that
5870680	5875320	you've so wait wait did we kill all the enemies you killed this enemy in this area right now
5875320	5879960	there's some enemies still around but they're gonna take a bit to get to you so in the brief
5879960	5885000	moment oh let's free some slaves yeah they start cheering and they're like yeah down with the
5885000	5896040	demons yeah that's what we're all about i cast slave free headline four score and i was also
5896040	5901160	gonna go with an abraham thing yeah i mean that's the first thing you think of i'd hope so when you
5901160	5906200	were like when you learned that abraham lincoln when you're like a little kid kid kid like like
5906200	5910680	like like fifth grade and they would say abraham lincoln freed the slaves did you think they were
5910680	5915400	in a container and he just opened it yeah i picture because i knew we knew what abraham lincoln
5915400	5919080	looked like like because you see him in the outfit like you know what i was like i really
5919080	5923160	would picture him like i thought it was like my mom would be like he freed the slaves and i
5923160	5927000	like you're a kid you don't you don't know that has anything to do with a document that he signed
5927000	5931320	you're like picture this big tall skinny guy dressed with this funny hat and then he like
5931320	5935960	actually went i would just picture like he like unlocked the chains and the thick thick of night
5935960	5937880	and people like wait is that the president
5940680	5948200	free to go come on guys get out of here i really did we got us a war to win i was like when i i
5948200	5954040	was like what is this slave we're very enlightened society pakistan doesn't have a history of slavery
5954040	5962040	so not a big deal it's not a big deal it's not a big deal at all i mean presently yeah we're
5962520	5969240	doing horrible stuff but if you have a google alert for pakistan where's the saddest
5970200	5974760	saddest thing every day it's true maybe one day you guys will know have slaves
5977480	5983160	oh i hope so okay we're sharp people let's ask if these guys know where your father is
5983880	5987320	that's why we came back here yeah well first we want to free him because there's other monsters
5987320	5991400	here so let's let's let's let's capitalize on there i hope i have some extra weapons i'm not
5991400	5994680	giving them my bow but i could give one of them my sword if he looks healthy enough to fight
5994680	5998680	can we sort of do the denarius thing where we free him and you're like you don't have to fight
5998680	6004120	for us if you want to that's definitely the angle we're gonna play yeah we want we want
6004120	6011320	i mean it'd be real cool if you did i mean we did for you but your freedom is yours let's do it
6011960	6019720	yeah you you begin setting to work uh unlocking the binds on these uh slave guys but you as you
6019720	6025160	free like about three or four you hear like a slithering from behind like you might you might
6025160	6030200	you know be approached by more people pretty pretty soon you guys free the other slaves we're
6030200	6035320	gonna deal with this yeah sounds like a good plan quirk solid plan uh yeah i like this but we don't
6035320	6040440	command them to do it we go if you want to free them you can right you you don't yeah we'll pay
6040440	6045640	you to free the other slaves i don't know i kind of like to go head strong towards the noise yeah
6045640	6051960	let's do it okay whirling around you see a large pit in kind of the center of camp it seems kind of
6051960	6059560	freshly dug and uh there's like a bubbling slimy sound as like several of these slimy humanoid
6059560	6066600	creatures pour out of the hole and slithers towards you slowly like slugs well maybe are
6066600	6075000	you guys good guys or bad guys they go bad guys
6075000	6080440	okay
6082520	6091000	they form a wall of oozing flesh cheese yeah it's gross demons man what's the wall
6091720	6096200	blocking it's blocking the pit that they came out of i mean it's not what no one wants to go there
6096200	6102520	yeah it's it's like flies on shit like guys don't don't get up we're gonna go the other way anyway

6131960	6138840	torches and i like them and i start walking back like i start going back and forth but facing them
6138840	6144200	just to keep them away like drawing on your religious knowledge you realize that demons
6144200	6150280	are typically resistant to fire right so they don't want to oh so i'm just saying
6150280	6161320	uh-huh all right i want to use my amulet of spring to summon my thorny vine armor which it says
6161320	6167160	i can command to stop protecting me and lash out to entangle a foe yeah so i want to do that
6167160	6175240	immediately all right summoning fourth um the season's vine amulet of spring birth of rebirth
6176040	6178920	thorny armor protect and surge
6185400	6189640	vines burst forth from the ground and wrap themselves around your arm before launching
6189640	6196120	off said arm towards the wall of flesh composed of the many oozy humanoid demon things let's see
6196120	6203800	charlie sheen do that you couldn't string together that sentence it begins uh entangling the foes and
6203800	6209000	they seem to have their forward momentum halted and it'll take them a while but they seem like
6209000	6215080	they might be able to free themselves but it buys you valuable time all right let's uh let's tune in
6215080	6220600	what next week oh is that it that's good comp trolling that's it that's 10 o'clock yeah five two
