0	23240	Oh yeah, from Hollywood, California, and Meltdown Comics, where all good podcasts go when they
23240	24240	grow up.
24480	26320	Harman Town is now in session.
28960	29840	Welcome, friends.
29840	30880	Welcome, newcomers.
33120	34280	Are we Spencer-less tonight?
36000	37760	Let's not bring out Spencer, sadly.
37760	38560	No Spencer.
40320	42080	But don't think of us losing as Spencer.
42600	45000	Think of us gaining a mayor, Mr. Dan Harman.
55040	55800	What's up, Dan?
56160	57360	No, nothing, nothing.
58440	59040	It's you often.
59040	60080	This probably never happens to you.
60920	63720	People, do you always say the opposite thing and people say, how's it going?
63720	65360	And then you say, nothing.
65640	66000	Yeah.
66800	68520	And then they say, how are you?
68520	70080	And you say, wait, that's the same one.
70120	70560	Nothing.
71000	73640	But whatever, whatever the other one is, I do it wrong.
73680	75120	OK, so it's going to be a bad show.
76720	78480	You got a nice little haircut there like that.
78520	78520	
78520	79000	Thanks.
79240	79440	Yeah.
79560	80120	Where do you go?
80120	80640	Who's your guy?
80960	81640	You have a gal.
82280	85160	Twenty three in the front and fifty in the back.
88280	89040	It's the new.
90480	91120	Where do I go?
91120	92920	I go to that place on Hillhurst.
93560	97280	Opion, Opion, Opion, Opion.
98040	102520	It's decorated like kind of a like a like a like an Armenian swamp cave.
102520	102880	Oh, yeah.
102880	103360	That's what I say.
105040	107640	But it's like it's rejuvenating.
107640	109400	Stay away from me.
111640	120960	So the only thing, oh, there is one there's one piece of business, official
120960	121880	business to get out of the way.
121880	127920	So as you guys know, I'm a big user of the app Cookie Collector 2.
130040	130760	Looks like that.
130760	132760	And then you collect cookies.
133880	135920	Each each each menu makes a sound.
137040	138120	Oh, there's okay.
138200	140280	That's well, let me sorry about this.
140320	141160	Let's start the show over.
141600	143760	Oh, that's a that's a little crunchy sound.
147760	150120	Okay, but you can mute it.
150240	154320	And after a while and you play with the mute, collect cookies, you go like that.
155640	157920	And then you gather cookies.
157920	165560	I have one hundred and twenty point eight to shreddikillion cookies at 16 point
165560	168320	one five seven duodikillion cookies per second.
168840	172720	But that's a misleading figure since each cookie can be upgraded to be worth more
172720	176280	cookies at the cost of cookies.
178120	182280	Each cookie you gather is is a kind of currency that you can use to create, for
182280	184880	instance, structures that create cookies.
184920	190320	Everybody, please, please, please file slowly out of the exits as the cookie
190320	192120	press, the baker, the dispenser.
192120	195520	You can get a grandma, a tree, things that make cookies.
196040	196360	All right.
196400	197560	But let me get to my point.
198440	200200	And of course, this is under the heading.
200200	201480	We have some business to take care of.
203000	205120	I probably don't have to tell you each day of the week.
205120	205920	There's special things.
205920	208520	Sunday is a milkshakes appear twice as often.
208520	210120	I don't have to tell you what milkshakes are for.
210800	215440	You use those to buy cookies or to bring all the boys to the art.
215480	220600	They recently, they recently did an update where they have league play now.
220680	222640	That's why I'm talking to you guys.
222640	228240	Oh, so I, uh, my bakery, it was called Butnut, but I had to change it.
229280	233080	Because I don't think it would let you, so I, I, I had started a cookie
233080	236040	collector to team called the crumb rumblers.
237800	242360	I'm just letting you know that I'm not telling you, you have to join my cookie
242360	244960	collector team and help me collect cookies.
245000	251040	Uh, it's, if it's something you were already going to do and you're looking
251040	254620	for a cookie collector to team, just know that I have one called the crumb
254620	257240	rumblers, oh shit, I'm missing a fucking cookie storm.
257360	257960	God damn it.
259560	260720	Oh, fucking missed it.
263120	264720	What happens when you miss a cookie storm?
264720	266760	First, you don't get as many cookies.
266760	268000	You fucking asshole.
268800	269840	I know you know the answer.
270200	271920	How often do cookie storms come along?
271920	272680	Are they predictable?
272680	279760	Every, every, every, every eight minutes, the rainbow cookies, the cookie
279760	282680	storms are now that you're, now that you're the, you're the gang leader
282680	288480	of the crumb rumblers, uh, how many people can be a member of that team?
288480	289600	Infinite amount or?
290000	291080	I'm not who I don't know.
291640	294840	And now that, but when you have a team, you can all like, you're all going
294840	296520	into this cookie collecting together.
297520	300720	Like, yeah, well, I'm sure all the cookies we collect get added up and then
300720	303760	we get ranked, uh, there's other, there's other teams.
304160	305240	That's all, yeah.
305240	306360	I'm not going to belabor the point.
306360	307440	I want it to be entertaining show.
307480	309160	How many crumb rumblers are there right now?
309200	309640	Just you?
310240	312160	Um, yeah, as far as I know, just me.
313600	314000	I'll see.
314000	316440	I was, the other thing is like, I would assume, okay, let me, let me,
316440	317920	cause I think there's a passcode maybe.
317920	319480	So that'll be our final order of business.
319480	320720	And then we'll get on with the entertainment.
321400	323200	Um, the crumb
323200	326040	I don't like that we're using our podcast for you to shill for your
326040	328640	own crumb rumbler cookie collector to team.
329000	329520	All right.
329640	333080	Uh, my team, the crumb rumblers.
333800	334040	Yeah.
334080	335080	I'm the only member.
335160	337600	It says members one out of 50.
337720	338080	Okay.
338480	342240	Collected 39,742 cookies passcode.
342360	343560	You want me, I want to write this down.
345040	347240	Seven, seven, one, fuck milkshake.
350720	351840	Double milkshakes today.

352360	355120	Double milkshakes, double milkshakes and Westworld.
357480	357760	Okay.
357920	358320	All right.
358520	359720	The fuck is our job?
360880	363800	So I think, I think there's probably some people here that are just fans of logic
363800	365360	that are like, what the fuck is this?
365440	365760	All right.
368560	370040	Is that your cookies or is that somebody else?
370920	372880	We don't tolerate any bullshit with phones.
375720	376040	All right.
377680	378520	Uh, anyways, okay.
378520	380560	So I was giving you that passcode and then we'll get on with the show.
380920	383560	The passcode is seven, seven, one, eight, one, three.
383560	385560	I don't know if that gives you access to my cookies.
387080	389880	I don't know if you can use that to like buy shit on the, I don't know,
389880	391720	but that's, that's a, that code again.
392560	393200	Oh fuck.
393440	394920	Seven, seven, one, eight, one, three.
394920	395920	How do you open the new iPhone?
395920	396320	I wrote it down.
396320	398080	Seven, seven, one, eight, one, three.
398960	399240	Yeah.
399600	399880	All right.
399920	404800	Well, listen, so far, I would say one of the best Harman towns of all time.
408920	410880	The crumb, the crumb rumblers, sir.
411040	412960	Crumb rumblers, seven, seven, one, eight, one, three.
413080	415160	And the world famous seven, seven, one.
415160	415640	Here it comes.
415640	416920	The crumb rumblers.
417040	417840	Oh, it's the car.
418000	418480	Yeah.
418560	418800	Yeah.
419600	420640	No, not all one word.
420920	421240	Nope.
421280	422200	Spaces use it.
422200	423720	Spaces spelled crumb, right.
423760	424280	Do it all.
426240	428600	If you, if you, yeah, I don't want to, I don't want any of that shit between
428600	429560	crumb and rumblers.
429680	429960	Yep.
430560	430920	Okay.
431360	432840	The crumb rumblers.
435040	437160	Just pretend it's the name of a movie.
437200	441120	And you were, you saw that you might get kicked off for being team button up.
441760	443560	I thought my bakery's name was button up.
443560	446320	And I, yes, I try, I kept trying to create the crumb rumblers and it kept
446320	449240	just like blanking out and I was like, I bet it doesn't like the button up.
449280	451280	And I changed my bakery name to Dan Harmon.
451280	454600	So now it's, it's the crumb rumblers and I'm in there alone.
454880	455840	Let's move on with the show.
455960	463360	Cause my name on Transformers earth wars, they didn't allow, I got, I, they, they
463360	466880	changed my name for me because you wanted to be negatron.
471080	471640	They didn't do it.
471640	475120	I was going to do Optimus rhyme, but, uh, they would have allowed that one,
475120	476280	but that's already been taken too.
476280	478400	So, all right.
478480	480600	Well, our team is channel one on one.
480600	482800	If you guys want to join us channel one on one.
483640	485480	I don't want to fight like Transformers earth wars.
486560	493840	Anyways, but hasn't cookie collector to become a competitive team thing now?
494000	494360	Yeah.
494840	497120	And it's going to be better than Transformers earth wars.
497120	503640	Let's, uh, you guys, I missed out on that whole Amanda Knox thing.
503640	506360	And you guys see, I just watched that documentary on Netflix.
506360	508680	Did you, I didn't even know what was going on when that was going on.
508680	509880	You know who Amanda Knox is?
509880	512000	I do not watch the documentary.
512000	512680	It's pretty interesting.
513120	513440	That's all.
514400	515960	Well, thank you for clarifying that.
516760	517520	That's worth a watch.
517520	518360	It's a fascinating story.
518360	521200	You won't believe it happened right under your nose in 2013.
521760	523520	You know, it's, I just missed out on it.
523520	530200	It must've been busy on one of my hit shows, uh, the, the, the, uh, but it was
530200	532720	very, yeah, it was very, it was very interesting, very interesting.
535720	537000	You guys looking forward to Westworld?
537080	537720	Okay, good.
538600	538920	All right.
538960	539880	I'm going to watch that tonight.
540320	540680	Let's go.
540680	541400	I guess let's get on.
541400	544680	I can't watch anything because I'm moving places and my, I have no TV, no
544680	546800	internet, no wifi, no nothing.
546800	549720	I'm, I'm living in a, in a Twilight dark age.
550280	552760	Well, you can come over, come over after the show and watch Westworld.
552800	553440	Watch it tonight.
553640	553840	Yeah.
554080	554880	Oh, okay.
555360	555680	I will.
557040	557640	That's a date.
557760	557960	Yeah.
558920	562080	There's, I, we had pizza and stuff last night and they left the
562080	562920	box out to the dogs.
562920	564960	Probably, this probably probably place probably looks pretty bad.
564960	566120	I'll have some of that dog pizza.
569680	571240	The house is probably kind of a mess.
571280	572120	Do you have a friend in Toronto?
572120	572920	That was pretty fun, right?
573080	573360	Yep.
573440	574240	I had fun in Toronto.
574600	575720	Yeah, I enjoyed it.
577040	577400	All right.
578960	583200	Well, if you guys are, uh, in my podcast audience, then you're a fan of quality
583240	587280	rapping and the hip hop lifestyle.

602640	606320	Uh, yeah, I'll give you kind of a, like one of our old school beats that, you
606320	607720	know, we're not going to use later on.
607760	608120	Okay.
608560	612040	Let's do, um, check, check.
614040	614360	Yeah.

620320	622520	crapping, I'm doing running around a circle.
622520	627320	That's called laughing, rapping of your pussy like I'm mapping your pussy.
628440	632080	Cartography, your pussy saying, here's the north, here's the south.

647680	649360	I'm going to wrap it left and right.
649360	652280	And when I get done lapping, go to sleep tonight.
652640	652920	Okay.
652920	654160	So it's warmed up.
654200	654720	It's warmed up.
655160	657800	No, I didn't mean any of that, uh, misogynistically.
658960	664320	Dan, can we try, if you don't want to, this is pushing it too hard.
664560	668280	Like just do like an acapella, like you're like a doo wop on the corner,
668320	672520	kind of just like you just freestyle, like just, just, you know, like singing acapella.
672840	675400	Vote, but with this.
675680	675920	Yeah.
675920	676680	Can we do together?

702520	704440	Gonna squeeze them all night long.
704440	707200	And I'm gonna sing a doo wop song to her nipples.
707560	710280	Like they were microphones, because I'm a man-child.
710280	711520	I'm afraid to be alone.
711520	714120	So I need a woman in my life.
714720	721600	I better stay away from the knives, because I'm lonely and I'm angry and I'm bad.
726320	726680	All right.
726680	729720	Well, well, we're all warmed up.
729720	730320	What's, what's.
730680	735680	I mean, $10, that's, you guys got a fucking cheap, cheap admission.
735680	737520	This is too much program for you guys.
737560	740480	Let's, let's bring out our new, I gotta turn this off so I don't just keep.
741480	742880	Let's bring out our new friend.
744880	746360	Ladies and gentlemen, logic.
751200	756840	DJ logic, professor logic, psychological.
756880	759520	Yes, that was actually my first rap name for real.
759520	760280	Psychological.
760320	761720	Yeah, awkwardly enough.
761720	764000	And who the fuck is going to call somebody psychological?
764000	765520	Hey, psychological, pass the salt.
766320	767240	No, definitely not.
767240	767840	So yeah.
767880	769960	And then my homie just called me logic for short.
770160	774680	What is Justin, Justin Roiland has a, has a kind of as a rapping alter ego.
774720	776280	Uh, w what's his name?
776280	778600	Uh, psychic abilities.
779720	782400	But that's a real thing when he told me that I thought he was joking.
782400	784320	Well, it's, I mean, it's a real thing.
784320	786200	I mean, he's, he raps in gibberish.
786200	789040	He goes, he just raps like gibberish words that rhyme.
789160	789840	So funny.
790240	790560	Yeah.
790880	794640	When I, when I first met, met him, he was like, yeah, man, just come to my house.
794720	795960	This is very rare.
796000	798560	I was talking to him on Twitter because I was like, I love Rick and Morty.
798560	799640	And he was like, oh yeah, okay, cool.
799640	800480	Come to my house.
801920	802920	I was like, what?
803400	804880	So, uh, I was like, okay.
804880	809120	So, so me and my wife, we went over there and we met, uh, him and Abby and they
809120	812920	were very drunk and there was like nine other people that I didn't know.
812920	816200	And it was very awkward, but by the time I left, everybody was family and it was
816200	817280	awesome and it was great.
817280	817560	Yeah.
817640	818800	Did he make you do VR?
819360	820600	Of course he did, dude.
821360	822560	He totally did.
822560	823040	Yeah, no.
823040	824880	And, uh, but me and my wife, we loved it.
825320	825600	Yeah.
825640	825840	Yeah.
825840	826760	I got to get my set up though.
826760	827720	I don't, I don't have one.
827760	831160	I have, I have like a PC, but I got to get like a real like set up.
831280	834600	I have a, yeah, you got, you have to dedicate a room to it in your house.
834640	839000	If you want to do the vibe, the Oculus, you, the Oculus is lighter weight, but
839000	842720	you have to use a game pad and like, you kind of like, like that's, but I don't
842720	844120	know, I can't, it's, it's tough.
844120	845880	That's like the VHS beta thing.
845880	846720	You don't know what I'm talking about.
846720	847200	You're 20 seconds.
847200	848520	I have no idea what you're talking about.
849360	851160	It's, uh, yeah, it's the two big things.
851160	853640	It's like, what's going to be the mainstay DVD Blu-ray.
853640	854720	You might've been around for that.
854720	855200	Yes.
855720	856560	I know that.
856600	857880	Uh, yeah.
857920	860840	And now we're all living in the cloud with young rappers like yourself.
860880	861080	Yeah.
861080	862800	The cloud is fucking weird, man.
862880	867240	Cause like that's, I try to go know, cause I like to keep all my stuff on the
867240	868800	super download cause of hackers.
868960	872200	I've gotten like hacked before, which sucks, but they, but they never really
872200	873640	get any like real information.
873640	877160	Cause I'm like, I'm like an idiot for like letting them know, like having
877160	880720	the easiest password to give him your cookie collector passcode.
880720	884960	They got like the easiest shit, you know, like pussy seven dash or whatever.
884960	889920	But, um, pussy seven, do you mean when you say you get a hack, do you mean
889920	893560	like they break into your like bin of like unfinished albums?
893560	894040	No, no, no, no.
894040	896480	That's what I'm saying is like, no way.
896520	900200	Like, no, they just get like, no, they, no, they get like Netflix.
900800	904280	And then, and then like, so if you, if you log into my Netflix, it's Bobby,
904280	905000	which is my real name.
905000	907120	And then, uh, Jess, which is my wife's name.
907280	908760	And then it's like family, you know?
909080	912080	And then still somebody hacked my shit and was like, yo, dude,
912120	913320	follow me on Twitter.
913400	914040	Fucker.
914760	915760	I was like, what?
916720	917560	I was like, what?
917840	918440	So yeah.
918440	921080	So that was, and then I, I apologize to you.
923880	927640	So I wised up and my, uh, my assistant who's here, his name's Christian.
927640	930560	He was like, why the hell didn't you have two step verification on?
930840	933840	Cause like, and everything has two step where you just get like a, uh, a
933840	936120	text to your phone, giving you an extra code so you can't get it.
936240	936720	So I do that.
936840	939200	But when it comes to, uh, when it comes to like, like actual
939200	942960	wraps and music files and all that stuff, I don't do anything over the internet.
943160	944160	You know, it's just to be safe.
944200	946000	It's just all on DAT tape.
947600	948440	Flash drives.
948520	948960	That's it.
949040	952240	It's just like me and my buddy, uh, my main producer and then my, uh, my
952240	953760	engineer, and so we just, that's it.
953920	957960	The only time I think we send actual files over the internet is if it's like a,
958000	960560	a beat and it's just like, it isn't even anything yet.
960560	961720	And I'm like, Oh, I really liked that beat.
961720	964760	And if I like it, then I'm like, you better go back to that fucking email
964760	965560	and delete that beat.
965560	966560	So nobody like steals it.
967200	969320	You won't even do a coded Dropbox thing.
969320	971360	Like, like, like you won't send anything over the internet.
971360	973400	Dude, I like deleted my Dropbox.
973440	973720	Really?
973720	973960	Yeah.
973960	976920	Cause it's not even like they got any serious information.
976920	978240	Cause like, I don't do that.
978320	980920	Uh, I don't, I don't put anything out there really.
981200	984920	Um, but it was just weird cause I was like, Oh shit, they, they,
985240	986640	they've got my Snapchat.
987600	989280	And they were like, but they weren't even posting anything.
989280	989960	It was really weird.
989960	992200	They were just like, go follow gangster, kill a seven.
992200	994400	It was like the weirdest like names.
994440	997240	I live in real terror and I haven't really done anything decent about it yet.
997320	1000000	I like, but I did, I started using one password.
1000000	1000800	This isn't an ad.
1001080	1004560	Uh, like, like it's like, I finally just gave in and started using one of those
1004560	1009000	apps where it, it just generates these crazy long ass passwords.
1009000	1013000	And then you, so that every time you want to get anything, you have to like go
1013000	1016880	there, copy, then paste a long ass password that even you don't know.
1016880	1017040	Yeah.
1017040	1020080	I think my assistant has that too, but fuck that.
1020160	1023200	But when the fat, when the fappening happened, that was a warning
1023200	1024480	shot across my, my bow.
1026480	1027680	Yeah, that was pretty crazy.
1027880	1031200	But it is true that around that time, that's how we know the guy that runs
1031200	1033240	the server for the, for this thing.
1033240	1037160	Like, that's kind of how I made friends with him is that he was a fan who he,
1037200	1040880	he was like down deep into that whole crazy world.
1040880	1045780	And like, he let me know, he said, like, do you have, and like named all of my
1045780	1051120	Apple equipment and like some other shit that I was like, what's going on?
1051120	1052080	How did he find that out?
1052080	1060160	And he said there, because your, your, your, your iCloud password, which is so
1060160	1064120	simple, that's how the fappening happened is that everybody's like iCloud, iCloud
1064120	1067680	passwords are like, are like the name of their dog or it's just like, or it's just
1067680	1070240	like password because no one took an iCloud seriously.
1070760	1074120	And, and, and, and, but iCloud gives you your address book.
1074240	1080760	It's just like, it was just a, and so like I, because, you know, I'm somehow
1082840	1088880	ancillary, if that's a word related to like some, you know, like someone that,
1088920	1091920	that was fappable, fappeningable, fappable.
1092960	1096960	Like they're my, they, they were, they had my, they, they had already hacked me.
1096960	1101400	They just hadn't, like the way it worked is that like they can, you get hacked by
1101400	1103600	like just an autonomous like thing.
1103600	1107560	It's just like a machine that just drills away at your shit on a server
1107560	1113720	somewhere, but then you, you, the hacker comes back and opens that treasure chest
1113720	1119040	and pulls shit out and they hadn't done that, but these, some people had found
1119080	1121320	the stuff and so he was, he was warning me.
1121320	1124680	And that's crazy, but that's some, yeah, like I've, I've actually had that happen
1124680	1127880	to me as well, where people will like tell you, and they're not actually dicks.
1127880	1130640	They just do it for like a weird sport.
1130680	1132040	They're like, yeah, I just went into your shit.
1132040	1136800	I'm just letting you know, like, I swear to God, like I see that a couple of times
1136800	1141240	when I, when I was still using windows back in the, back in the day, um, back in
1141240	1147760	the day where people, when people said back in the day, I had, I had heard like,
1148080	1150400	remember AOL discs, totally throwback.
1150400	1150720	Sorry.
1150720	1152960	It talked about like IP scanners or something like that.
1152960	1156280	Like software that just scans for IPs and how windows was so vulnerable.
1156440	1160120	And I just, I just got one of these free apps that like scanned low, you know,
1160120	1164240	IPs, just went through lists of them and, and probed them for open ports.
1164240	1165880	It's not even about guessing passwords.
1165880	1168080	It was like windows was so vulnerable.
1168080	1172240	If you networked your home system, the way to get it to work, like often
1172240	1176160	involved, like if you only knew a little bit about what you were doing and not
1176160	1179360	everything you were, you were bound to be open to the public.
1179640	1183080	And so I just like, I ended up like, I just wanted to do it.
1183400	1185400	And then I, I was like, Oh, I'm in here.
1185400	1187640	And then it was like, Oh, those are your tax documents.
1187640	1191200	And I was like, I left a lot of little, I felt like a dick for even doing this,
1191200	1194200	but I felt like it was better than not doing anything and just leaving and left
1194200	1197800	little texts, little, little, little text documents that said, look, I'm sorry.
1197800	1198600	I was here.
1201480	1203400	I was here and there's your social security number.
1203400	1205000	And I don't have, I'm not looking at it.
1205000	1205520	I swear.
1205520	1208520	Like that's crazy, but I, I was just dicking around.
1208520	1212920	I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a 30 year old dude in, in, in Las Feliz.
1213320	1213960	Here's my name.
1213960	1214680	Come get me, dude.
1214680	1217600	I never understood how people actually got that.
1217640	1220520	Like the ones who are like, yeah, I'm gonna cause, you know, like Kylie Jenner,
1220520	1221640	all these like different celebrities.
1221760	1222640	That's how it happened with me.
1222640	1226080	It was like this, this dude who like hacks into people's Snapchats and it's
1226080	1227800	just like, yeah, Pussy Springs or something.
1227800	1230840	Like he just does this, just he'll just like tweet the most random shit or
1230840	1234360	whatever, but I always wonder like, how does like somebody go, I'm going to
1234360	1237840	hack this person shit and like Jack into the fucking matrix, man.
1237840	1238960	That's like so weird.
1239240	1241120	I just see that codes, like those green codes.
1241120	1243760	Like when I think of some guy like, yes, I'm going to destroy your soul.
1243800	1244120	Yeah.
1244240	1244560	Yeah.
1244560	1245680	So yeah, I know.
1245800	1249360	Well, that's what's terrifying about like, uh, well, that there's so much
1249360	1253560	crossover with the guys that can do that and the, and the alt right and stuff.
1254040	1258960	You can, cause you can just like, just by being a human being that has feelings,
1258960	1263600	like you and your politics, if you stay on publicly, you could end up like, you
1263600	1268160	know, being an example that gets made, like people will find some serious shit
1268160	1273200	on my, if you hack my stuff, like I make an easy fun target, like, like
1273760	1276960	everyone, even my fans want to see me go down.
1276960	1280280	Like that's, that's part, that's part of what they enjoy.
1280280	1282520	Like they show up here to watch me fail.
1282520	1285960	Like it's about the shape of my head or something.
1285960	1287720	Like, I love watching you go down.
1289680	1290520	Nice.
1290600	1294640	Uh, but you, you, you, uh, you were born, you're from Maryland.
1294920	1295160	Yeah.
1295160	1298200	Originally I'm from Maryland, which is near DC for those of you guys who don't
1298200	1301920	know, because usually I'm like, Maryland people are like, what, where?
1301960	1303320	So yeah, East coast.
1303320	1303920	It's a state.
1304400	1305080	It is a state.
1305080	1305560	It is a state.
1305560	1306360	It's a very small state.
1306360	1308080	We're known for crabs, but not the sexual kind.
1309480	1310840	Uh, that's Baltimore.
1315360	1316200	Fuck Baltimore.
1316200	1316560	I'm sorry.
1316560	1318880	The fucking Baltimore is a piece of shit.
1318880	1319440	So that's good.
1319480	1319920	That's good.
1319920	1320640	Maryland humor.
1320640	1323560	And if it wasn't for the Baltimore, for Baltimore, we wouldn't have the wire.
1323880	1324400	That's true.
1324400	1325040	Really awesome.
1325040	1325240	Sure.
1325240	1328000	Or, or a Poe, a Grelin Poe.
1328000	1328400	Indeed.
1328440	1330960	I did not know that now I can claim that shit, son.
1331040	1331360	Yeah.
1331400	1332040	I didn't know that.
1332640	1334240	But what, what, what part of Maryland are you from?
1334600	1336040	I'm from Gaithersburg, Maryland.
1336080	1337360	Um, in Montgomery County.
1337400	1341320	And, uh, I was born at Shady Grove hospital at 7 36 AM.
1342000	1344840	By the way, that was the first time someone's in a city and nobody clapped.
1345120	1345440	Oh yeah.
1345440	1346920	I'm from Gaithersburg motherfucker.
1346920	1347480	Come on.
1349000	1352120	Um, no, but yeah, it sounds nicer than what Wikipedia in your
1352120	1354520	childhood section, uh, says it is.
1354560	1355400	You know, it's crazy.
1355400	1358700	So I grew up, so I grew up, uh, section eight household welfare, food
1358700	1361620	stamps, all that stuff, uh, to a black father and a white mother.
1361660	1364260	And I'm biracial, but look very white, obviously.
1364860	1370140	Uh, which can be really, yes, which can be, uh, very, very confusing.
1371580	1373420	But, uh, Dan's half jealous right now.
1373700	1374500	Half jealous.
1378420	1380020	Um, yeah, man.
1380020	1381860	So I grew up there and, uh, it's weird.
1381860	1385420	It's one of those places where it's like on the outside, it kind of like looks
1385420	1388620	really beautiful, but then you like take a left and you're like in the hood.
1388700	1391460	Like you're in like a really fucked up, fucked up area, which is kind of anywhere.
1391460	1394140	I mean, anywhere in the world, there's good places and there's bad places.
1394420	1398460	And me, I, um, I'd never really tried to glorify any of the negative shit.
1398620	1399380	Would you like a drink?
1399620	1400300	Uh, I'm okay.
1400340	1400580	Thanks.
1400580	1405580	I drink scotch swag, but I just, I only just started drinking.
1405580	1406940	I only drink a little bit here and there.
1407580	1409700	Well, someone just got fired because we brought this out for you.
1409700	1410300	I never drink.
1413660	1417940	This water, but yeah, so, so I grew up, I grew up there and, um, and it was, it
1418020	1419740	was not that great.
1420380	1422780	It was like, was it, was it like bad neighborhood?
1422780	1425820	Like, like, did you feel, did you feel it?
1425820	1428100	Well, it says, it says that your mom and dad were,
1428140	1429660	they were both drug addicts and alcoholics.
1429660	1433900	So my, my, my father was addicted to crack cocaine and my mother, she was, she
1433900	1435220	was addicted to pills and alcohol.
1435580	1439260	So I never actually had a father in my life, which is really hard.
1439260	1443260	And then also all my brothers and sisters are not to get all fucking deep.
1443260	1444700	This is supposed to be like really fun.
1445020	1447540	You think they come here for my fucking cookie game.
1449020	1452740	This is why they're, you saw, you saw how high the bar was when you came out.
1453340	1455220	And it's not for my hilarious standup either.
1455220	1458300	And so it's, no, no, no, go deeper, go home.
1458620	1459060	Mr.
1459060	1459580	Logic.
1459620	1464900	It was, uh, it was, it was really, it wasn't necessarily, um, about where
1464900	1466420	I live, but my actual household.
1466420	1469980	So, uh, all my brothers and sisters, they're all black and they all look
1469980	1471300	black and have black features.
1471540	1473300	And once again, I'm the only one who looks white.
1473460	1476460	It was very hard to identify when you're raised in a black household
1476460	1477140	with a white mother.
1477140	1480300	And the crazy thing is that my mother was also extremely racist, which
1480300	1483220	sounds weird cause it's like, how's this racist shit gonna like fuck all
1483220	1485820	these black dudes, but like, that's what happened.
1485860	1489180	I don't know how it happened, but that's what happened.
1489180	1493100	I mean, all, all men hate women and look how many people we have together.
1493140	1494900	Like we managed to work it out.
1494940	1496580	Yeah, it definitely works.
1496580	1496740	Ms.
1496740	1500740	Logic, was she racist across the board or just?
1500780	1501460	No, you know what?
1501460	1505220	It was, it was one of those things where I think obviously like, I mean, it was,
1505260	1507660	it's a, it's a, it's a very confusing thing cause some people will be like,
1507660	1508820	well, that doesn't fucking make sense.
1508820	1510460	And I'm like, yeah, I know.
1510460	1513460	Like I had to live that way, you know, and grow up and like, I'm really, and
1513460	1516220	she was super like Bible thumping, like Jesus freak.
1516380	1518660	And I'm, I'm, I'm a very like open guy.
1518660	1519620	I'm an open-minded guy.
1519660	1522900	I'm the type of dude that's like, I believe in equality for all race,
1522900	1525540	religions, color, creeds, and sexual orientations, like period.
1525700	1527860	And if you want to argue and fucking kill each other, you do it over there.
1527860	1530980	I'm just going to like chill and watch Rick and Morty and fucking like
1530980	1531460	be real shit.
1531460	1532460	Like I'm just going to have fun.
1532820	1535860	Um, so, but she was like total opposite.
1535860	1538860	And I always think like, I don't know how I didn't become a Satanist,
1539060	1541260	like just to spider, you know what I mean?
1541260	1543180	But, um, but I, it's never too late.
1543580	1544180	That's true.
1544780	1545420	That's very true.
1545700	1550380	Um, but yeah, no, so I think it stemmed down with her family because I know that
1550380	1552260	her side of the family was very racist.
1552260	1555900	So like my, my grandparents would never let me like come over and I'd always
1555900	1556620	be like, Oh, please.
1556620	1557820	And they'd be like, no, the guest room.
1557820	1559180	Cause they were balling and we were poor shit.
1559180	1560660	They're like, the guest room is not available.
1560660	1562060	And I'm like, Oh, I'll sleep on the couch.
1562300	1563420	And they're like, Oh no, the couch.
1563420	1563700	No.
1563700	1564900	And I'm like, Oh, I'll sleep on the floor.
1565140	1566220	And they're like, no, I'll get out of here.
1566220	1566860	You fucking neighbor.
1566860	1569380	So finally you found it.
1569380	1570500	You feel all right.
1570500	1571780	Well, let's just, we buried the lead.
1571820	1575020	Yes, but anyway, so that was like confusing.
1575060	1575220	No.
1575220	1575660	What were you going to say?
1575700	1582100	Well, was that like, like, if you're, if you're, your siblings look more black
1582100	1588060	than you and you're in a biracial household, you're getting it from both angles.
1588060	1590500	You're not, you're not black enough to be black.
1590500	1592340	And you're not white enough, like, you're not.
1592860	1593540	It's really weird.
1593540	1596060	It's, it's, that's what I had to deal with my whole life.
1596060	1600060	And then leading also into my career because I, you know, like literally being
1600060	1602740	a, being called a nigger by your own mother and then going to school.
1602740	1604580	And then people are like, you fucking cracker white boy.
1605460	1606420	And it's like, what?
1606740	1607500	Oh, shit.
1608420	1609660	The fuck's going on.
1609660	1610100	You know what I mean?
1610100	1612420	Like, I better become a successful recording artist.
1612420	1616780	Yeah, like some shit better go down with a built in audience of zero.
1616780	1623380	People just keep accusing you of co-opting your own culture.
1623420	1623900	Yeah, I know.
1624420	1625220	Going back and forth.
1626180	1627180	But, but that's what I did.
1627180	1629580	I just focused on music and it was very difficult.
1629580	1633180	And so, um, and you had to focus on logic, not to be corny about it.
1633180	1636420	But I was, you said you really, you, you like Dirk Diggler.
1636420	1640260	You thought long and hard about your, your name, how you arrived at like
1640260	1642660	psychological and then, and then shortened it to logic.
1642660	1645340	But I think the, you know, well, you know, I'm babbling.
1645340	1645900	You're doing fine.
1645900	1646380	Keep talking.
1647100	1650020	But, but it's, it's like, like, like, yeah, I mean, that would, what,
1650020	1651340	what other recourse do you have?
1651340	1655180	I think that's where, I think by the way, that's where, that's where good hip hop
1655180	1657260	and like nerd culture totally overlap.
1657260	1661340	It's just nerds are like, wait, how am I, it's not, it's not equitable.
1661660	1665580	I don't want to make that, that, that, that crime, but like nerds
1665580	1667140	always draw that analogy.
1667140	1671300	It's very, it's like, like, wow, you're getting it from all angles.
1671300	1674780	Like you don't know, like that's, and that's why we get into like
1674780	1677860	Spock and like, like Star Trek and sci-fi.
1677860	1680060	It's something to escape in and that's what I used to do.
1680060	1681060	So I love video games.
1681060	1682620	I'm a huge video game guy.
1682620	1685340	So I love like Last of Us and Uncharted and like those real games you can like
1685340	1687700	jump in and just engulf yourself in.
1687700	1691260	And I used to play those, those games to escape and to like run away from my life
1691260	1692260	and not deal with it.
1692260	1695300	And then through that, as I got older through my teenage years,
1695300	1697780	I realized that I could do that with music and like truly write.
1697780	1701420	And now here's the real crazy thing is like, so my mom is like this super Jesus
1701420	1703540	freak crazy racist white bitch, right?
1703540	1709260	But then on top of that, on top of that, I'd like be writing raps, you know,
1709260	1711580	to try to vent and talk about these things.
1711580	1714700	And she'd be like, don't you curse, God damn it, motherfucker.
1714700	1715780	So she was also that.
1715780	1719420	So it was very, it was very suppressive and like it was very difficult.
1719420	1721660	But I worked through it and I worked on music.
1721660	1726580	And then when I was when I was 16 or 17, I left I left the house because it was
1726580	1728180	just so it was just so horrific.
1728180	1728860	It was so bad.
1728860	1730820	She was just like on so many pills.
1730820	1733580	And I got two jobs to support myself.
1733580	1735700	And I worked those jobs for a long time.
1735700	1738420	And it was one in one in the morning and one at night.
1738420	1742620	Unfortunately, I didn't graduate high school because back then I just I just
1742620	1743660	there was so much going.
1743660	1745140	I mean, I've seen my father smoke crack.
1745140	1745860	I've been kidnapped.
1745860	1749380	I've seen my mother, you know, get beat by men and my sisters were raped
1749380	1752980	and my brothers were in the street selling crack, even sometimes to our own father.
1752980	1755260	So it was a lot of crazy shit that I was seeing.
1755260	1759300	But every time I was like, this isn't right, I knew that it wasn't right.
1759300	1762500	You know, and that's where I think everybody else and I'm not going to say
1762500	1766820	necessarily failed and I'm not going to try to highlight my family and say the right
1766820	1768620	or wrong that they did or who they went to become.
1768620	1772220	But I think that's what what it is, especially within the inner city, you know,
1772220	1777980	in different places where, oh, OK, if I go work at McDonald's and I make five
1777980	1781940	fifty an hour or I can go sell crack and make five thousand dollars in a day.
1781940	1785460	And it's really fucked up and it's really terrible and it's really horrible.
1785460	1789100	And when I saw this, I was like, OK, well, don't beat women, don't sell crack,
1789100	1790340	don't do this, don't do that.
1790340	1793020	What you need to do is you need to write about it and you need to tell the world,
1793020	1795700	you need to tell the youth that are coming from where you're coming from,
1795940	1796900	you know, to get out of that.
1796900	1799980	And so that's that's what I did and are what I tried to do.
1800180	1802860	And pretty much you were good at it.
1802980	1807460	I was I was sure a lot of people are like, I'm going to I'm going to rap about this.
1807700	1814060	Yeah. And then they're like, yo, yo, yo, yo, fuck your mama.
1814060	1816900	Crack more like more like bad rock.
1817700	1819500	Don't smoke it. You've got to poke it.
1821540	1823180	Yeah, so that was my best friend.
1823180	1826780	I was I was I was doing a voice like I was imitating a bad rapper.
1826780	1829860	But my secret was I was rapping as good as I could.
1831740	1834900	Nice. I'm actually going to go home to the logic.
1834940	1838780	I was pretty good. Are you a free style or two or are you mostly a writer?
1839540	1841740	Honestly, I write and I love to write.
1841740	1844940	But I think that any person who raps should have fun and freestyle.
1845940	1847220	Yeah. How does it how does it free?
1847220	1850660	I always I'm so I'm always so confused about freestyling because I when I listen.
1850660	1853660	Oh, you've made that very clear.
1858420	1861420	When we when we
1862500	1867420	when people are freestyling, like whether it's in a it's in a biopic movie
1867420	1871660	like Eight Mile or this feels fucking eight mile like be rabbit right now.
1872460	1875180	I can't even see like people pass like the second row.
1875180	1877940	This is crazy. Oh, fuck you, Doug.
1877940	1882940	But are the people I assume it's like like if you freestyle a lot,
1882940	1886300	then the more you freestyle, the more arrows you have in your quiver.
1886300	1890500	I like you're also like a one thing you're like phonetically
1890500	1892820	engineering your mind from an early age.
1892820	1896300	Like for you or a child, you were like you were drawn to hip hop.
1896300	1899220	I feel like Eminem was like like he was like a savant.
1899220	1904060	Like when when his first album came out or what it was like, like it's
1904060	1905100	it's all about studying.
1905100	1908220	So like if you really want to do so like a lot of rappers go,
1908340	1910100	yeah, I'm going to get these bitches hoes.
1910100	1912220	You know, I'm saying these chains and shit, dog.
1912220	1914620	And then it never works out.
1914620	1918020	And it's the people that actually say I'm going to turn this into,
1918020	1919500	you know, I'm going to make this a business.
1919500	1920660	I'm going to be a walking company.
1920660	1922820	And I'm going to first and foremost do it because I love it.
1922820	1924500	But I'm going to fucking make something out of it.
1924500	1927020	And that's that's what great the greats did.
1927020	1928900	That's what I'm doing my best to do.
1928900	1932340	Well, now it's even harder for you, harder slash easier in a sense.
1932340	1934340	I mean, like I guess everything just changed.
1934340	1939900	But like you're the I you're the second Wikipedia article I've read.
1941180	1947860	It's that it sounds it sounds so similar to The Weeknd, who I love that guy.
1947860	1948900	That's my homie.
1948900	1952380	And was like, it's like, oh, you look at it's like the parallels are it's like
1952380	1955980	it's this is the new career path is you have to be a ninja and like make yourself
1955980	1957780	out of nothing like you don't get to.
1957780	1961780	You have a mentor in your in your development, but and you have a record
1961780	1965460	label that comes along, but not before you build yourself out of dirt without
1965460	1969220	permission completely like you and the weekend just came out of nowhere.
1969220	1972660	And you have to release these mixtapes and but they're not tapes anymore.
1972660	1975780	They're digital and these kids are with their pants are so low.
1979460	1981100	But and it's and it's got to be lonely.
1981100	1985940	And it's got to be like, how do you that's the age old question.
1985940	1987460	Everybody in Los Angeles is always asking.
1987460	1988980	How do you know when you're supposed to quit?
1988980	1989740	How do you know?
1989740	1992500	And I always say, but it's a very convenient answer.
1992500	1994220	It's easy for the people that they're asking.
1994220	1999820	They're not asking the people that say, oh, damn.
1999820	2002060	Well, yeah, I thought about it that way.
2002060	2002940	Holy shit.
2002940	2005740	Thank you for asking me that question.
2005740	2009660	There's there's never a writer's panel for failed writers.
2009660	2016500	You know, like people come and they go, how do you know when you should quit?
2016500	2020260	And I always say it's easy for me to say, but it's like, I do believe this.
2020260	2025700	Like, well, you have to you have to really believe that you wouldn't let that
2025700	2030060	you would do it for free and that and that if you did it for 20 years and then
2030060	2034100	got hit by a bus without ever having an amount to paying your rent, that you
2034100	2038460	wouldn't go, oh, man, I wasted 20 years that you'd go, that's pretty cool.
2038460	2039100	I got to write.
2039100	2039940	You loved it.
2039940	2040900	That's a big part.
2040900	2045460	You know, and I think I think for me, I'd probably be like dead in jail or
2045460	2046300	addicted to drugs.
2046300	2047140	And that's what I saw.
2047140	2049140	And that's a fucking Debbie Downer.
2049140	2050460	Wah, wah.
2050460	2054180	But like legit seeing that, I was like, oh, shit, son, got to write these
2054180	2058580	raps, dog, like, I can't not after having written about all that childhood stuff
2058580	2059900	and how you grew up.
2059900	2062780	I mean, are you, are you, have you gotten all that out of your system?
2062780	2065260	Or is there still is there an endless trove of stuff to write about?
2065260	2066180	Question.
2066180	2066500	Okay.
2066500	2068980	So you have to soon start rapping about your gardener.
2068980	2074260	No, this is, this is the thing is your second album ends with like, and that's
2074260	2077180	what I had to say, mom about Coke.
2077180	2080740	And then your third album starts and it's like, stop interrupting me at dinner.
2080740	2083860	I'm trying to eat with my wife.
2083860	2085500	It's just a message to fans.
2085500	2086660	Yeah.
2086660	2089060	Yo, my wife is like totally with that.
2089060	2093340	Every time we go out, cause I'm like, I'm like so nice because I just can't, I just
2093340	2096700	like, but sometimes I'll be eating like, yo, okay, today.
2096700	2097460	No, it's real shit.
2097460	2098660	I love my fans straight up.
2098660	2099660	Love my fans.
2099660	2102900	I'll do anything for my fans except like sexual stuff.
2102900	2106620	But like, so I was at, uh, Hey, you said you're an open guy early.
2106620	2107620	I know.
2107620	2108620	Yeah.
2108620	2109620	Turns out you're a fan of phobe.
2109620	2111180	Uh, no, so I, no, no, no.
2111180	2116780	So I was at Fry's electronics today and so I get there and there's a lot of like young
2116780	2118260	Hispanic males working.
2118260	2119260	And those are a lot of my fans.
2119260	2122340	I have a lot of Hispanic males in Los Angeles, California.
2122340	2126660	And uh, any you'd like to give a shout out to shout out my boy Jose and Juan.
2126660	2127660	Those are real people.

2128660	2129660	Yes.
2129660	2130660	Um, no.
2130780	2135140	No, but so, so just being there and like, Oh, it's like, you know, some people notice
2135140	2137020	and you know, some people would be like, Oh, Hey logic.
2137020	2138020	I really like your music, man.
2138020	2139020	And they fucking keep it pushing.
2139020	2140380	I'm like, Whoa, that's so cool.
2140380	2147780	Cause typically how it goes is, Hey, demo suck dog, yo, you're on my fucking Snapchat.
2147780	2148780	Say what's up.
2148780	2149780	And it's not even like, Hey, how are you?
2149780	2150780	Or like shaking your hand?
2150780	2151780	Like legit.
2151780	2152780	It's like, yo, can I take a picture?
2152780	2153780	Like, fuck dude.
2153780	2155780	You're gonna like buy me dinner first shit.
2155780	2156780	You're just gonna fuck me.
2156780	2157780	You know what I mean?
2157780	2158780	Like I'm serious.
2158780	2162060	I'm so down to have a conversation and hang out and whatever the case may be.
2162060	2164260	But it's usually like, what can you do for me?
2164260	2169540	There's been times where I've like, I've done a show, had 103 degree fever, uh, was out
2169540	2170540	back.
2170540	2172980	Like, I know this sounds gross, but like throwing up and puking my brains out after the show
2172980	2176740	because I was just so sick from doing 45 cities in a row.
2176740	2182140	And fans are like, Hey, and they throw it while I'm throwing up or like taking selfies
2182140	2183180	with me.
2183180	2186100	So there is a negative side to it as well.
2186100	2189380	Um, but like today I got followed in the bathroom while I'm taking a piss and some
2189380	2191540	dude's like, Hey man, uh, need me to shake your dick.
2191540	2192540	No, I'm just kidding.
2192540	2199500	But he was like, but he's just, I apologize.
2199500	2203060	It's like, you gotta let some shit go, man.
2203060	2205120	The weird thing is that he didn't say anything.
2205120	2207700	So it's a guy who works there and he just walks in.
2207700	2212780	He's just like staring at me and like, you know how sometimes, uh, guys, uh, in the urinal,
2212780	2217860	you can like see on the, like the, with the metal fleshy thing handle, uh, the reflection.
2217860	2221980	And I just see this dude just kind of like staring at me and I'm like, this is so fucking
2221980	2222980	wrong.
2222980	2226620	And then I turn around and wash my hands and I'm like, so is this guy going to say anything
2226620	2227620	to me?
2227620	2228620	And he like, does it say anything?
2228620	2231980	And I, and I fucking leave and it was really awkward.
2231980	2233380	He might've just been a murderer.
2233380	2234380	Yeah, maybe.
2234380	2235380	Yeah.
2235380	2236380	You never verify it.
2236380	2237380	Yeah.
2237380	2242660	You might've been like, I have no idea, uh, do you find, okay, I'm going to, I'm going
2243180	2254420	to, like, I hit there was a, there was a point when I had enough people, uh, um, in like
2254420	2259260	to my surprise go, uh, I know who you are.
2259260	2260580	I like what you do.
2260580	2263100	I'm so happy you're alive, et cetera.
2263100	2269820	The validation that, that I hit, there was a tipping point where I feel like I internalized
2269820	2274020	it to a point where I can live off of it.
2274020	2275020	It hasn't been cut off.
2275020	2279060	So I don't know how big that tank is, but then I kind of like, I have this self-awareness
2279060	2286180	that that doesn't like, it didn't make me taller or more handsome or, or a better person
2286180	2287700	even that I did this stuff.
2287700	2293780	But because those people say the things that I always wished the people would say, which
2293780	2297380	is why I wished I would be, I don't want to never wish to be taller, more handsome, but
2297380	2301140	I understand exactly what you're saying that I, that it's like, I hit like this wizard
2301140	2302140	of Oz.
2302140	2304980	You, you could have gone home anytime you wanted like tipping point where it wasn't
2304980	2305980	a bad thing.
2305980	2307060	Like it was all a lie.
2307060	2312980	It was a good thing that it was all a lie that it was like, Oh, I now know how my body
2312980	2321540	feels and my brain feels when I assume someone in the room is, is, is amazed that I'm going
2321540	2323020	through this TSA checkpoint.
2323020	2327340	See that's why I always, and it makes me less cranky and like, like it's, it's like this
2327340	2331260	weird, like I hate admitting that because it's like kind of a douchey thing, but at
2331260	2334860	the same time it's like, I wish I could give that bill to everybody.
2334860	2335860	That's fucking awesome.
2335860	2338380	And I know what that, I know what that feels like.
2338380	2343380	But I always do my best because here's the thing, like, especially with hip hop and like
2343380	2347420	the younger generation, everybody thinks other people think they're the shit.
2347420	2348620	That's gotta be really extreme too.
2348620	2349620	So that's what I mean.
2349620	2353580	So I always do my best, like once again, treat everybody equally and with respect and kind
2353580	2354580	and introduce myself.
2354580	2357620	Not even like, yo, I'm logic unless it's like a professional setting like this and
2357620	2358620	I'm backstage meeting people.
2358620	2359620	I'll be like, Hey, I'm logic.
2359620	2361020	Or if there's fans, I'm like, Hey, I'm logic.
2361020	2364780	But like when I meet you, so just, you know, anybody, I'm like, my name is Bobby.
2364780	2365780	That's my fucking name.
2365780	2366780	I'm not gonna be like, yo, something logic.
2366780	2367780	And they're like, what?
2367780	2368780	What?
2368780	2369780	Yeah.
2369780	2370780	You know what I mean?
2370780	2374340	So, but what I'm saying is, is, is, can I, can I talk you right there?
2374340	2375340	Yeah.
2375340	2378820	Because I, I was, I was checking into a hotel with my girlfriend and it was like, like in
2378820	2379820	Beverly Hills.
2379820	2381460	My hotel name is Mike Hawk.
2382460	2383460	It's a real thing.
2385460	2386460	Yes.
2386460	2390660	We were going from the lobby to the elevator and it was like, there was, there was this
2390660	2394660	like giant dude and I guess it's important that he's black, but I don't see the world
2394660	2395660	through that lens.
2395660	2401260	But, but it was like, he had a, he had a baseball cap on, like he, he definitely looked like
2401260	2405580	he belonged in a Beverly Hills hotel, but at the same time he got, cause like his clothes
2405580	2410060	were all new and like he, but he was full of all this weird energy and he was like dragging
2410060	2414340	a bunch of bags on a, on a cart, but there were, it was like, and it was like, he just,
2414340	2418380	he was a really big dude and I was like, I was like, and then he like, he came out of
2418380	2424580	the elevator and he just called out to someone that I couldn't, and he was like, yo, sneaks,
2424580	2425580	sneaks.
2425580	2427260	Like he was just yelling for sneaks.
2427260	2428260	Sneaks?
2428260	2430020	And I, and I, I was just like, just, just play it cool.
2430020	2432100	And I got in the elevator and then I was just like, to my girlfriend, I was like, do you
2432100	2435860	think sneaks is famous or do you think that guy is like way out of line?
2435860	2440020	Like, like, it's just like, like sneaks, like what if sneaks is just a friend and
2440020	2445900	like is the, is the, is the hotelier, uh, go, going like, God, geez, these guys, they,
2445900	2451380	they just come by and one of them's named sneaks and they, they're just so loud or,
2451380	2455380	or is sneaks like a Grammy winner and which, and why is that okay?
2455380	2458740	You know what I love about you, Dan?
2458740	2461300	Is that I always interrupt you with a perfect story.
2461300	2462300	I love that.
2462300	2469100	Like, dude, you're like fucking crazy, man, and you make me feel good, bro, cause I love
2469100	2474460	the way you think, man, because I think about the craziest shit all the time, bro.
2474460	2475460	Like you know what?
2475460	2476460	Let's talk about last night.
2476460	2477900	No, two nights ago.
2477900	2480380	And I was at my house hanging, playing pool with my buds, right?
2480380	2483420	We promised that you wouldn't talk about this.
2483420	2486860	I'm a bit of a pool shark.
2486860	2490580	And so I'm walking and I take my, I take my dogs outside and I have a new, a new little
2490580	2491580	puppy.
2491580	2492780	His name's Panda.
2492780	2493780	What's the breed?
2493780	2494780	He's a little corgi.
2494780	2495780	He's a corgi.
2496780	2498780	I got a puppy named Panda.
2498780	2499780	Oh, what breed?
2499780	2500780	It's a Panda.
2500780	2501780	Boo.
2501780	2502780	I just wanted to repeat that joke.
2502780	2503780	It's funny.
2503780	2504780	Piggy has a Panda.
2504780	2505780	Nice.
2505780	2506780	I have a Panda.
2506780	2507780	Wicked.
2507780	2512780	And, and the, the, because he didn't even give it a real name.
2512780	2513780	All right.
2513780	2514780	All right.
2514780	2520140	Well, the other dog, his name is Philip, Philip J. Frye.
2520140	2521420	We call him Frye for short.
2521420	2522420	Yes.
2522420	2523420	Kuchirama.
2523420	2524420	Let's go.
2524420	2525420	Fuck yeah.
2526060	2527060	Sure.
2527060	2528060	Johnson.
2528060	2529060	Jojo.
2529060	2530060	I have no idea.
2530060	2531060	Yeah.
2531060	2534100	So anyway, so we're walking and it's nighttime and I see this, this, this snail with a fucking
2534100	2539740	big ass shell and I'm walking past this snail in my backyard and I'm like, whoa, snail.
2539740	2540740	That's crazy.
2540740	2543800	I hope like one of my dogs don't eat this snail.
2543800	2546660	And so the first dog comes out and sniffs it and I'm like, no.
2546660	2547660	And he's like, oh shit.
2547660	2548660	All right.
2548660	2549660	Cool.
2549660	2552420	So he walks on by and then the little puppy who like doesn't really know, know yet.
2552420	2554420	So I'm just like, rah.
2554420	2555820	And he's like, oh shit.
2555820	2556820	Okay.
2556820	2557820	Cool.
2557820	2558820	He keeps walking.
2558820	2559820	I'm like, man, I wonder what the fuck that snail's thinking.
2559820	2560820	You know what I mean?
2560820	2561820	Like, like real talk.
2561820	2562820	I'm like legit.
2562820	2563820	I'm thinking like, man, like, does he even understand?
2563820	2564820	Does he know how close he came?
2564820	2566420	And I'm like, wow, this is so crazy.
2566420	2568020	And I'm like, I gotta, I'm serious.
2568020	2569020	Okay.
2569020	2572940	And I'm like, I gotta make sure this fucking snail is okay because he's in the middle of
2572940	2576460	the sidewalk in my backyard and I got to make sure that like he makes it to the grass.
2576460	2580300	So I'm like posted and I'm watching my dogs and then everything's cool.
2580300	2581300	My wife's walking by.
2581300	2582300	I'm like, Hey, watch out.
2582300	2587300	You know, people coming by and then my buddy six comes out and I'm like, yo, there's a
2587300	2588300	snail.
2588300	2589300	Watch out.
2589300	2591300	And then crunch.
2591300	2593140	Yeah.
2593140	2596020	So anyway, I'm like, yo, does this snail have any kids?
2596020	2597020	Like what the fuck?
2597020	2598020	You know what I mean?
2598020	2600300	But this is like real shit that I think.
2600300	2605020	So when you go off on such a just sales market, snails marry for life.
2605020	2606020	Are you serious?
2606020	2607020	Are you?
2607020	2608020	No, I know.
2608020	2612260	You know what I always worry about with snails is that they're, they're dead.
2612260	2619220	And that's must be horrible because they're like, they're like, what was this shell for?
2619220	2623540	Because it's like, what is that for?
2623540	2626540	To protect them from warrior snails.
2626540	2628120	I guess it's effective that way.
2628120	2633260	Like if a snail tries to kill you, having a shell is like fucking whoa, he's like Batman
2633260	2635500	because it's like, it's thin as a, like a fingernail.
2635500	2636500	It's like so thin.
2636500	2640540	I mean, when you, when you do, if you've ever had the displeasure of realizing you've stepped
2640540	2644540	on a snail, it's like, I mean, those, it's like, it's like, Jesus Christ, the, the thing
2644540	2651940	that it bought to protect itself, it turns into a thousand knives.
2651940	2653980	I guess that's, I guess that's us in cars.
2653980	2658300	I mean, like, like, like, we're just driving around in fucking pieces of glass that are
2658300	2662540	temporarily in one piece, like whizzing them at each other.
2662540	2663940	I never thought about that.
2663940	2666820	And now you've given me like 80 million more things to think about.
2666820	2667820	Thanks a lot.
2667820	2668820	Yeah.
2668820	2669820	I appreciate it.
2669820	2672580	I mean, there's a lot of snail stuff out to keep snails out because I guess there's,
2672580	2673580	isn't it like salt?
2673580	2674580	Yeah.
2674580	2679660	Well, the snail stuff is it's, well, there's no, that's for slugs, like hardcore, okay.
2679660	2680660	Slug stuff.
2680660	2683500	It's like, but somebody told me, it's like, you know, they're not eating that and it's
2683500	2684500	poisoning them.
2684500	2686460	It's like, it's like little to, it cuts them.
2686460	2687740	Oh, that's fucked up.
2687740	2688740	Yeah.
2688740	2693460	See, this is like the microscopic, like fucked up world of like earth and all the shit that
2693460	2695020	happens behind the scenes.
2695060	2701140	But then our producer, Dustin Marshall told me that acetaminophen, the reason why it's
2701140	2706380	a fast acting ingredient in drugs or something is it has little molecules that are, that
2706380	2707860	cut up your stomach.
2707860	2709460	So it gets in your bloodstream faster.
2709460	2710460	Well, that's fucking gross.
2710460	2717180	And I was like, man, this fucking kid, Dustin, you don't know yet.
2717180	2718180	He's fucked up.
2718180	2721620	Like that's the only reason I want to live to a healthy old age because I want to see
2721620	2723260	how fucked up he is at 40.
2723260	2724260	Wow.
2724260	2725260	Nice.
2725260	2728300	Because he's like, he dresses like Beetlejuice.
2728300	2733940	Like he's, he's got a, he's got a whole podcast network that used to, that used to be like,
2733940	2734940	okay, he's got a podcast network.
2734940	2736340	Wait, is this the guy I met?
2736340	2737340	Yeah.
2737340	2738340	Total Beetlejuice.
2738340	2739340	Yeah.
2739340	2741340	Look, don't say it one more time.
2741340	2743340	Don't say it one more time.
2743340	2744340	You got it.
2744340	2745340	You got it.
2745340	2747340	Fucking be right out here.
2748340	2751060	It's like Marilyn Manson, Beetlejuice.
2751060	2752060	Oh shit.
2752060	2753060	It was great.
2753060	2756740	No, I don't mean that in a bad way.
2756740	2757740	He comes in.
2757740	2758740	He's really nice.
2758740	2760540	He looks like he's about to kill a rock album.
2760540	2761940	You said Beetlejuice a third time.
2761940	2762940	Oh shit.
2762940	2768860	You thought, you thought like Marilyn Manson was my uncle or something.
2768860	2772860	Uncle Manson.
2772860	2774540	I got to watch you work recently.
2775540	2780500	I was so impressed just like, like, not like I have a bunch of hip hop artists to compare
2780500	2786180	it to, but I was impressed as a creative because you're so young and you're, you've had your
2786180	2787180	own success.
2787180	2792620	So, and I'm sure the lesson you've learned is that you know best and that you're, that
2792620	2797540	you'd have that Steve Jobs like Loeb would be inflamed, which is not a bad thing in my
2797540	2798540	opinion.
2798540	2808740	It's like, oh, I got to, sometimes the curse of genius, my friend, is non-collaborative.
2808740	2813660	You're like, you have a healthy like fear of other people.
2813660	2818140	See, that's what I've learned from my predecessors, both in comedy, because I love comedy and
2818140	2822340	I think, I think like the parallels between comedy and like rap is like, it's the same
2822340	2823340	shit.
2823340	2825100	It's all about punchline and timing.
2825100	2829700	And for me, I've always been very open because I know what I know and I know how to rap and
2829700	2833340	I know how to do this and I know how to perform and I know, I know that and nobody can tell
2833340	2835200	me how to do that the way I do it.
2835200	2838860	But the things that I don't know, I go to the people that do and I just, I just shut
2838860	2839860	the fuck up.
2839860	2843540	I was like 39 when I figured that out.
2843540	2845300	So I guess you're more talented than me.
2845300	2846300	No, no.
2846300	2850220	It's not a competition, you piece of shit.
2850220	2851940	But no, I was, I was very impressed.
2851940	2855700	Like you can tell, yeah, you're an old soul and or there's no such thing as old souls
2855700	2861660	and you were the son of the drug addicts in a horrible political racial situation.
2861660	2862660	Nice, wicked.
2862660	2865540	You were forced to become Vulcan and wise.
2865540	2866540	Logic.
2866540	2871740	But that, I'm assuming that could easily make you more combative and isolated and autonomous
2871740	2872740	and all this stuff.
2872740	2877380	But I was like, like you, the reason we met is because he's working, he did a little thing
2877380	2884860	for season three of Rick and Morty, which it's not even a spoiler because like you'll
2884860	2890700	know you won't remember this conversation in 2019 when it comes.
2890700	2897460	We're a little behind schedule, but there's an I won't spoil the specifics of the episode,
2897460	2901780	but it was like great that Justin knew you and like you came in and it was like, I didn't
2901780	2905660	I figured you were a cool guy or like you wouldn't be coming in in the first place,
2905660	2911180	but I didn't expect what you came in and you you worked in front of us, which is like
2911180	2917500	it took me so long before I could I could I used to like I wouldn't be able to write
2917500	2921900	on airplanes because if someone might next to me might be watching my process.
2921900	2925900	I could let a little and then when I started doing community as a hit show, I did for NBC
2925900	2928420	in 2009.
2928420	2934980	I went through a period where it took me it took me time to learn that it was okay to
2934980	2939860	sit at a keyboard with a screen and have other people looking at the screen while I
2939860	2945540	was like deciding what someone should say like that was like the equivalent of watching
2945540	2948340	me masturbated poop like like like I get it.
2948340	2949340	I totally understand.
2949340	2953900	I don't know how you say Dan that you're watching him work was he came in and like I had written
2953900	2960020	a shit like a like a rap for a thing and like like it was like placeholder lyrics is like
2960020	2964140	let's get it but you just came in and from top to bottom kind of looked at it welcomed
2964140	2969660	it found a tempo for it found a beat for it started going through the lyrics and then
2969660	2975420	changing them adapting them to give it basically a better you know like it was like it was
2975420	2980860	like the scene when Mozart is meet soliari and like and it's like oh that thing and it's
2980860	2984780	like he starts adding that's what you're doing which is what we wanted but it's like to do
2984780	2985780	it in front of us.
2985780	2990300	I thought it was and you weren't showboating you were you were lifting us up and like there
2990300	2996340	was no there was no brain of you being like you know what maybe just let me like are you
2996340	3000100	saying that like you looked at it that you you generate your own beat right on the spot
3000100	3003980	there but no what happened was and I'm not gonna get to I won't give anything away but
3003980	3008940	basically yet like like Dan said and it was really cool to think like damn I wrote some
3008940	3012420	shit with Dan Herman like that was like so cool like first of all just walk in the room
3012420	3015980	and it Justin's there and Dan's there and everybody's just being super fucking cool
3015980	3018620	and this is the first time I meet this guy he's like yeah motherfucker blah blah blah
3018620	3025020	he's like we're doing all these raps and I'm like whoa all right this is my kind of
3025020	3030420	party so you know so there's this like template and it's you know it's all this like really
3030420	3034620	fun stuff and things that have to do with the episode that wouldn't make sense without
3034620	3039940	him kind of writing it first because how would I know you know so he does these things and
3039940	3044460	then what I did was as I go okay well let me see what would be a good BPM for this beats
3044460	3048780	per minute how fast the song is okay and then I went on YouTube and got like a template
3048780	3052620	beat if you will just something fun I was some tribe called quest and so I got that
3052620	3058780	and I threw it on say what what song God lives through yeah which is one of my one of my
3058780	3063540	favorite beats by them so I did that and I kind of caught a vibe and I caught it and
3063540	3067220	then I basically took what he did and then and then rearranged it and then added things
3067220	3071820	and took things away and and you know we came to came to a good place but here's the thing
3071820	3080500	the reason why I think I could do that is because unlike I don't want to put this people
3080500	3084640	who didn't necessarily grow up in like the Twitter era you know what I mean I had to
3084640	3090140	do everything in my career in front of the world right which was hard you know because
3090140	3093540	once again there's people like I mean even in fucking rap I mean think about going my
3093540	3097300	whole life being like you fucking you're white or black or this or that or you're not this
3097300	3100820	or you're not that then you go to hip hop which is predominantly black and you're I'm
3100820	3106980	like hey my brothers and they're like no and then I got you a whole album about my
3106980	3112500	life and they're like okay kinda and I do a second album and really bring it home for
3112500	3116340	the brothers and they're like all right you're cool you know I mean so it's like it's like
3116340	3125940	don't go in that house oh I thought you were a movie I don't know I I don't know what I'm
3125940	3135340	doing so that was just fine I was grandpa sleepy logic I was just imagining all black
3135340	3144460	people saying things and hey I was I was adding to that what's up child grits it's cool I'm
3144460	3153060	black yeah yeah yeah it was great so I was impressed by that and and yeah and you're
3153580	3159340	so so but you were impressed with my rap writing obviously this is a real thing like like I don't
3159340	3163540	know if you're doing like a bit I was actually impressed with the wraps like it was so cool
3163540	3166340	I thought something was interesting it was a make a good segue because this is something
3166340	3169940	that I would ask you regardless of this had come up in that conversation but it's one of the first
3169940	3177340	things that came up is because I was I was going for authenticity with my with my template rap it
3177340	3186900	was festooned with the n-word I didn't know I hadn't I didn't know I didn't I I guess I kind of
3186900	3193260	so basically what happened was by the way it was a word nigga all over this shit right and I come
3193260	3197620	in and I basically I tell him this I was raised in this household this is a word that I use them
3197620	3203140	or it's just it's it's a part of the culture it's hard to explain but within my music I never
3203140	3213900	used this word unless it is what's unless it's hilarious unless it's commentary yeah exactly
3213900	3219540	unless it is it is a fool it is a true representation do you understand so it's being used to discuss
3219540	3226660	the issue that's a real thing or if it's part of the conversation that's happening maybe or
3226660	3231100	kind of something like that but it's like it all right just just understand like I've always had
3231100	3235620	a rule that until people know and understand because it's just it's just a word that's in my
3235620	3239380	vocabulary growing up in a black household having all black family and friends and it's just it is
3239380	3245580	what it is vocabulary and I didn't see there's a difference though it's like you're not a racist
3245580	3250940	man you're you're you're a writer you're a comedian like you use this to write so I try to live it up
3250940	3261980	monopoly games yeah but yeah so I basically was just like and showers are boring and and you
3261980	3267260	always you're always looking for a new thing to call your your your your friends and like all
3267260	3276500	right anyway it's just okay all right leave it leave don't take it there because what I like
3276500	3281900	about it is like there's this the dichotomy of bad word good word use the word don't use the word
3281900	3285340	it's all preference it's all preference and there's like and this is where we gotta get
3285340	3291780	racy no I'm just kidding okay terrible joke anyway so no but like it's all it's all like
3291780	3297020	you know there's things that my mentor said that you never argue about you know like race religion
3297020	3302260	politics you know just there's there's certain it's it's at sports it's like a thing that there's
3302260	3307060	no right there's a resolution yeah you exactly so it's like almost with that like here's how I feel
3307060	3313220	about the word and if you know when I go to concerts and I see the majority of the demographic
3313220	3317340	who are attending concerts they're all white so it's like if it's like Wu-Tang Clan ain't
3317340	3321460	nothing to fuck with nigga blah blah like whatever it's like don't get mad at the kid like you put
3321460	3326700	it in you know you put it in the song and they're they're reciting the song and they love you and
3326700	3330620	they're paying to see you it isn't a racist thing you know I mean there it's not from that place
3330620	3335980	anyway so me I just don't like to fuck with that in general so I was just like yeah I'm not gonna
3335980	3344740	say that and he was like cool right long story short I expected for I I context that's what I was
3344740	3349620	gonna say it's all about context like when I when I explained like my mother being racist or like
3349620	3353100	on the on the on the album that I'm working on I won't super get into that but like I'm wrapping
3353100	3359140	from the perspective of you know a black man who told me that I wasn't shit but a white boy and he
3359140	3364780	was like you're just a white boy nigga which is like so but no it's really funny cuz it's so like
3364780	3371340	that doesn't make any fucking sense what you just said and and so in that context is when I use the
3371340	3376700	word I love that idea that that language can be thought and that it doesn't have to have these
3376700	3381780	electric fences about it but at the same time it's not as simple as this libertarian linguistic
3381780	3386820	policy of like let's let it all slosh together because the most racist shit will be will be
3386820	3392460	cloaked in false equivalence people will go well I can say this but so-and-so can't say that it's
3392460	3398660	like yeah context and history and all these things so in one hand you you definitely want all of that
3398660	3403900	in place because that's part of language in history it's like that to me the enemies are people who
3403900	3409500	are certain about things and who have rules for other people about things and the and the people
3409500	3415700	that will quote-unquote solve any problems we have with with anything really are the people
3415700	3421220	that are so uncertain that all they have is to focus on is their is their own gut in their own
3421220	3426300	instinct and they have like this code and I thought that was I'm sure you're not the only one and I
3426300	3431660	took kind of like that that made me that they give me like a whole it just I don't know it just made
3431660	3436740	me happy it was just like I was just like oh that's so cool that that word can be like any other
3436740	3442340	chemical in a chemistry set it can be like yep there's sulfuric acid and like you can use that
3442340	3447540	to like different people have different rules for how much of it they use in what circumstances
3447540	3452420	they use and it's like their own relationship with it I was like that's that's what it is that's
3452420	3458460	where it is like you're snail I mean my guy's thinking about the craziest shit my role is very
3458460	3469940	simple I never I use it constantly when I am alone making sandwiches like like like like like I'm
3469940	3476100	just like it's all over all of my songs about how I need mustard and because it because I have
3476100	3484580	extra niggas it's just me it's like I I refer to myself in the third person as as as as that and
3484580	3491260	and then and then and then I need more mustard and Jeff Jeff does the same thing I know it's it's
3491260	3498060	it's like Worcestershire sauce in my house like it goes here and there yeah I I literally I
3498060	3502620	literally will use it as a pet name with my girlfriend like I'm gonna like like like like
3502620	3510300	we like these real thing we have to trust each other is this a bit is this a real you know what
3510300	3513820	here's one thing I just want to fucking say cuz there's a lot of people who like try to twist and
3513820	3518140	turn and all types of stuff and like Dan like you're such a like a nice guy and like and and
3518140	3522980	I wouldn't surround myself by people who weren't you know open-minded and like kind-hearted and and
3522980	3527460	one thing and I just kind of want to talk about this is there are there are extremists on both
3527460	3531420	sides and this is this is also what my album has to do you know what I have not talked about my
3531420	3536020	next album at all because it's not coming out until later next year but one thing that I will say
3536020	3541700	about it is it has to do not only with race relations but it has to do just once again with
3541700	3545740	the equality of all men women and children regardless of race religion color creed and sexual
3545740	3550860	orientation because I believe that we are all born equal but we are not treated equally and when
3550860	3555420	there's amazing people you know like yourself and I'm sure everybody in this fucking crowd
3555420	3560020	because you guys like love these guys you know what I mean and what the show represents is like
3560020	3563900	when when people will try to like pull the card and like flip it because I believe that there's
3563900	3568980	extremists everywhere you know I mean even like with with Black Lives Matter for example right so
3568980	3573860	when that hashtag was going around you know there was people tweeting me and saying why aren't you
3573860	3580100	hashtagging Black Lives Matter were you not black and it's like whoa like why would you say something
3580100	3583420	like first of all that's like the most racist shit and you're trying to you know what I mean and I
3583420	3587460	think that there there are extremists in everything you know I mean there's white extremists there's
3587460	3592900	black extremists is this is that and I think like for example like just to bring this up like Black
3592900	3598340	Lives Matter what that what that term means and this is just what it is represented from the black
3598340	3605420	community is that there are our black men women and children being murdered and you know they're
3605420	3609980	just saying like we matter too you know I mean that's all it is and then there's those extremists
3609980	3614300	who'd be like all right let's go kill a bunch of white cops or blah blah blah or the extremists
3614300	3618860	who would be like you know on the other side and I guess all I'm trying to say and this is one thing
3618860	3623300	whether you know me or you don't know me is that I'm here to represent fucking mankind and good
3623300	3631100	people like yourself who can joke around and have fun and respect everyone so swag I think there's I
3631100	3636580	think there's I think there's good people that get good results by doing by by like problematizing
3636580	3640860	things things that we complain about like that do focus on language and you should say this and
3640860	3646140	you shouldn't say that be mindful of when you say this or that like there are there are important
3646140	3651140	like like goalposts being moved by people who think that way and there are also horrible vampire
3651140	3656460	people who are like oh you can police language well now I just I just found myself a new bridge
3656460	3662540	to troll under like I'm so comfortable here and I always say like the litmus test is if you're
3662540	3668660	doing something that you consider activism like if it's not just expressing yourself which should
3668660	3677420	be joyful and easy for everybody but as a challenge like the the if you're if you are labeling in your
3677420	3684020	own head what you're doing is like speaking truth to power or or or sticking up for somebody or
3684020	3688780	something like that just quickly just a little baby flowchart in the sidebar of your head like
3688780	3695180	is what you're doing difficult at all are you putting yourself at any risk by saying what you're
3695180	3700100	saying that and and it's not to say that if the if the answer is no you shouldn't do what you're
3700100	3705300	doing it's just just remind yourself of that have that compass on your dashboard next to everything
3705300	3710660	else on your dashboard that should all be yours like like but always remember in those moments
3710660	3717820	like don't get too carried away because the people that were acting in racism in the 50s
3717820	3725700	they were they were outraged they were victims they were underdogs they thought that they were
3725700	3732780	battling a horrible force that was telling them that they had to eat sandwiches at the same counter
3732780	3739020	as other people like they were doing what was easy like they were expressing like all of this
3739020	3746660	outrage and it's like it it it's we we need to like that's like the big chain that I shake at
3746660	3752420	young people is like like a year there's probably an a couple like one-for-one analog between you
3752420	3757860	and some old white dude in the in the 50s like like like what as far as the amount of battle
3757860	3764220	you're fighting with this tweet like you're a tweet hashtag that's why I think it's all bullshit
3764220	3767100	because there's there's people out there saying like when once again when they're like why don't
3767100	3770420	you do this hashtag it's like no fuck that I'm gonna go do a whole album about it I'm not just
3770420	3774900	gonna do it so it lives in the moment to look cool like don't argue with me and I think at the end of
3774900	3780460	the day man it once again like I like to argue I enjoy it I'd love to have debates and crazy
3780460	3786100	conversations with people about race and politics and religion and fucking my favorite television
3786100	3791220	show or cartoons or anime or Rubik's cubes or whatever the hell I'm into but the thing is like
3791220	3797700	I love doing that with with like-minded individuals open-minded individuals like you know when I was
3797700	3803140	young my mom was super crazy about Jesus and now I'm like I don't know if God exists but I believe
3803140	3807100	in an energy and there's and there's certain people that would be like no fuck you you're gonna hell
3807100	3810980	Jesus exists it is what it is like you know what I mean yeah and then other people going that's a damn
3810980	3815300	shame because people that believe in an energy burnt women in the Salem witch trials and it's
3815300	3819660	like it's that conversation is about whether or not you should think what you think as opposed to
3819660	3823940	the other person going oh thank you for that information when I was young I did blah blah blah
3823940	3828020	blah blah and blah blah blah and then you both go uh-huh and then you're like both your brains
3828020	3831660	are a little bit bigger like even if you don't agree with someone no this is a real thing like
3831660	3835460	I've had conversations and they're like you know and this is why it's I've always been kind of
3835460	3839180	scared to have these talks and that's why I'm excited for my whole next album because it's not
3839180	3843700	just about black and white in this and that once again it's about everyone and it's like I was so
3843700	3849140	scared for so long to talk about this shit because like as soon as you bring up you know black men and

4047060	4052980	con panel next week in New York and I did it last I did it last year as well and it's for my last
4052980	4056580	album called the incredible true story which was originally going to be called the incredible true
4056580	4060820	story and transformation of the man who saved the world but like ain't no fucking blonde college
4060820	4066340	girl remembering that shit so we just changed it to the incredible true story which the acronym is tits
4066340	4076580	nice uh yeah and uh uh yeah so so I released that an elevator pitch uh is uh the year is 2065
4077540	4084100	in 2065 yeah the last human footprint was left on earth before sending to a space station called
4084100	4088660	babble where there was only five million human beings left and for the last 50 years from uh
4088660	4095780	2065 on we've been looking for a habitable planet it's like rap interstellar so so the cool thing
4096100	4101300	is is that uh at the beginning of the the album you press play and at the end of it is a skit and
4101300	4105380	what I like to call an audio cinematic experience now I was watching no this is a real thing I was
4105380	4110580	watching a that's a real fucking thing bro I was watching um a documentary called I Know That Voice
4110580	4115380	I don't know if you guys have seen it but I love it it's amazing and um while watching it I saw one
4115380	4119780	of one of my favorite voice actors of all time his name is Steve Blum he's done uh uh Spike on
4119780	4125300	Cowboy Bebop he's on Star Wars Rebels he's he's done so many different things and in his portion
4125380	4131060	of the interview he goes yeah I mean you know like this is a job anybody can hire you and I was like
4131060	4135940	what anybody can hire this guy are you serious so like I reached out to my people and I got his
4135940	4142500	agent's information and I was like oh my god yo I fucking love you I was like you're the best bro
4142500	4145940	and uh and and we met and we sat down and he agreed to do it mind you this is like one of
4145940	4150100	my childhood heroes I absolutely love this guy he agreed to do it and he plays a captain named
4150580	4156100	anyway so on their way to this planet called Paradise that they hope is is habitable for
4156100	4161700	human beings they're listening to oldies music from a hundred years ago and that happens to be
4161700	4166260	my album that they're listening to from there to there and it's like this cool really cool story
4166260	4170980	and um and that's what we're doing the panel on it's basically a year later how much has happened
4170980	4174660	and here's the crazy thing one thing that I really want to say is like once again you know I've
4174660	4178900	faced a lot of shit in my life and a lot of it's been really hard but the crazy thing is some of
4178900	4185220	the hardest things later in my life was being a nerd was like loving rubik's cubes and video games
4185220	4192500	oh my god you found this in hip hop fuck that was the weirdest he came into the room where we
4192500	4197140	and then I watched you work and you like like threw a rap together and we're like taking
4197140	4203060	suggestions and doing all this shit like it and then in the middle of it because you didn't bring
4203060	4207860	it I should have brought my rubik's cube today it was like damn damn it was like laying out because
4207860	4213460	Justin's a maniac yeah it's fucking weird um and and and it was a rubik's cube and you and
4213460	4219540	you picked it up and did it was like 1982 that's incredible like record setting like and then you
4219540	4225380	did it behind your back yeah damn I wish I had it why damn it yo blame my assistant christian
4225380	4230500	wherever the fuck he is right now no we'll have a second we'll show you I mean honestly
4230500	4238100	assistant christian assistant christian all the time has come
4242980	4246100	I can't be the first person to have sung as assistant christian that's definitely
4246100	4252340	you're the first person I fucking love it nice uh where's my record but it's okay because honestly
4252340	4256820	the thing about something really fast is that verbally saying that you did it as long as there's
4256900	4262260	someone to vouch for you it's just as impressive as watching it it's pretty cool super fun um but
4265460	4270900	I derailed you about that but I I think so so so you're already into the sci-fi scene your the
4270900	4277860	concept album scene um you you you came up from from underneath the the cloud through the through
4278500	4288820	through the cloud streets um like I I want you to have a radio play like hit song um if the weekend
4288820	4296420	can have uh 11 of them uh then then you can have you can have several you want to know something I
4296420	4300820	used to I was very distraught at different points in my career because I didn't have that and there
4300820	4304660	was actually times when I it's not that I was going to make different uh music because the
4304660	4308340	message is always the same which is one of following your dreams and doing what you love
4308340	4313060	but you know sonically I was like man there's there's times where I found myself in the studio
4313060	4317380	like man damn like this dude's popping or that dude's popping like damn should I make some radio
4317380	4320980	shit is that that's what's going to do it and I really there was times where I really thought it
4320980	4325060	would but I was like it just doesn't feel right did you have any embarrassing moments like where
4325060	4330020	you were like you were you tried a little no I mean I had I I would like sure I like made like
4330020	4333540	fun radio songs and it's not that they were bad it's just I was I looked in the mirror and I was
4333540	4339220	like nah this isn't me I can still make fun radio type esque records but not that sounds like
4339220	4344340	the same shit you know what I mean and so I told myself like no I'm gonna stay true to myself and
4344340	4348900	my roots and what I do and so just to not to flex but just to give you an example then this is why
4348900	4354180	we're doing the panel again a year later so nowadays I'm not gonna name any names because
4354180	4359460	I don't want it to be taken the wrong way but there's a lot of humongous pop stars that one
4359460	4363940	cannot sell tickets on their tours and two can't sell records where they're selling more
4363940	4368420	they're selling like fifty or sixty or seventy thousand now I know some of you guys Shakira
4368420	4373620	talking to you know Shakira now I know that some of you guys might think like oh no motherfucker
4373620	4377140	sell millions and millions of records like no that's not true this isn't like 96 you know what
4377140	4383140	I mean like that that that like legit that doesn't that doesn't work anymore and your hips lie now
4383140	4390100	they do so there's there's artists uh huge artists pop artists pop stars and you know
4390100	4395700	girls who sing pop and all this stuff who are only moving 50 60 70 80 000 units in their first week
4396820	4401460	and so I said fuck that you know because of singles and I said I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna
4401460	4407060	make albums I want to be an album artist and in my first week on my last album I sold 135 000
4407140	4413780	in the first week this is like everybody keeps arguing on tv panels that keep going oh television
4413780	4419300	where's television going and where's it and like it's like you know it's not like I'm the only one
4419300	4424340	that can see it but it just seems like it it's so obvious like all you have to do is just look at
4424340	4429380	the mp3 threshold that the music went through because of the lower bandwidth because a song
4429380	4433860	began as a thing that was you know it was 3.5 megabytes and it was there was a tipping point
4433860	4439460	we hit where the music industry was in big trouble as it was as it knew itself and then there was
4439460	4444340	all this argument about should we sue this technology all this stuff happens over and over
4444340	4449140	and over again I was a communications major in college before I dropped out a week into college
4449140	4454980	but they I did take the one class where they like this has been happening since when tv got rolled
4454980	4462100	out movies were like they they they said the exact same things that uh the record labels said about
4462100	4467620	mp3s but because they were like they went to the government and said you should make tv illegal
4467620	4472580	like because this isn't fair if people can look at a screen at home why would they ever go to the
4472580	4477300	movie when phonographs uh were putting people's houses people are buying phonographs and buying
4477300	4482340	records uh the people that made sheet music are like we're fucking out of a job and when sheet
4482340	4486340	music people have selling sheet music bands are like no one's going to go out and see live music
4486340	4490900	anymore because people can just go home and play it by themselves and then what the the truth that
4490900	4494740	emerges is it's never it's never more good it's never more bad it's more good and more bad
4494740	4503700	you have you you you have it's you you so what what you're saying is verifying my prediction
4503700	4513220	about how tv is going to go is that either vince gilligan or um a 26 year old vince gilligan that
4514020	4519140	doesn't have a breaking bad like available to him uh because he has all right next files staff
4519140	4522660	writing job or anything like like because there's no system left for him to go through
4522660	4527860	either or like they're they're going to like louis ck is already doing it like they're gonna
4527860	4535140	howard huesify the tv industry it's going to turn into just everybody's just self-employed like no i
4535140	4539700	i i agree i think um honestly a lot of people went when streaming of music first started everybody
4539700	4545780	was like no and it's hard but that's everything it saved the music industry so universal music
4545780	4551700	group which is like the biggest fucking label there is is up was up right two years ago more
4551700	4555540	than they had been in years and years because of streaming so i think what it really comes down to
4555540	4561220	it's just it's just like demand like we as as people in this in this era in time we want it
4561220	4564820	right now you know i'm saying like stranger things one episode fuck that i want them all
4564820	4569700	all right you know fuller house season two hurry the fuck up logic that's real you want to come
4569700	4576180	watch westworld at my place tonight there's pizza on the floor this guy when you when you
4576180	4580580	say you're making an album uh i'll i'll distract you from not having to answer that question
4581780	4585780	you're making an album like when you think of making an album because that's an art form it's
4585780	4592660	kind of gone away some people still do like like how many tracks is it all thematic like such a

4798260	4802340	question because like i've always so i just i played the forum the last time i was in l.a and

4812660	4816820	angle and i'm just joking but um i've always wanted to do the greek play the greek because
4816820	4820340	there's no bad seeds the thing i know but the thing is it's like that just capacity wise it's
4820340	4824100	only like six thousand it's it's pretty small but i heard as meal diamond said it's where
4824100	4829140	it's where great musicians get to go to when they die like it's that that's the place to play okay
4829140	4833300	supposedly it's a very satisfying like place i feel like it would be a lot of fun but i heard
4833300	4840020	that it's kind of quiet is that true no i mean i mean i've i've seen a lot of shows there and i've
4840100	4843860	been in the in the front and i've been way in the back and it's it's it's pretty tasty audio there

4928900	4934340	mentor inspiration she tells the most inspirational sad beautiful heartwarming story about when i
4934340	4938100	forget the name of the small town that she grew up in but it's quite small and i don't even remember

4951060	4955780	erected a big statue in the center of town of dolly and he kept saying to her like don't let this
4955780	4959540	go to your head you're still dolly you're still the girl from a small town like don't ever let this
4959540	4964260	become who you are like like this that statue doesn't mean anything and she's like yeah but
4964260	4968820	it's like it's my statue like like i made it dad and she's like yeah but like don't get a big head
4968820	4973140	about this she found out many years later that in the middle of the night he would go out and
4973140	4978820	clean the bird poop off her statue damn that's awesome what a good story i wanted to hate him so
4978820	4985460	bad no i wasn't bored i was fucking lost in fucking family rage i was like that fucking asshole
4985460	4991860	i hope this ends with him dying i was like no you what you were seeing was when you go at my
4991860	4995620	therapy exercises i was like he loved that statue more than anybody else because it was this little
4995620	4999140	girl and he wouldn't let any bird shit on her it was fucking great all right well let your little
4999140	5005220	girl think she's bigger than your so what were you gonna ask me before i pissed i took a piece
5005220	5009380	oh well yeah tell me about when you you say you're gonna make an album now which is a dying art
5009380	5013780	because like when we grew up albums were a thing that they were the story got told or even if they
5013780	5017860	didn't mean to tell a story they would arrange the songs in a way that if you could play a record
5017860	5022900	from front to back on on the first side and flip the tape or flip the record or whatever like you
5022900	5027700	were going through this journey so like you're if if you're one of those people you bring in your
5027700	5034020	weed uh on the if it was a like total concept album would fold it open and you could clean your
5034020	5039140	weed because you pinch it up here and the seeds rolled down into the middle so logic so when
5039140	5048980	you're making an album like how do you approach that and also is there like do is that's that's
5048980	5053300	where you think the market is right now that you think that people know the market's 100 million
5053300	5058660	percent not into the album the market is into singles and eps and fucking get you know make
5058660	5063220	as much money as you can as quick as you can and and once again that's where i had to defy the odds
5063220	5072260	i mean even with my last album it was a rap album about space but i mean like think like imagine me
5072260	5079220	walking into deaf jam okay like deaf jam and being like yeah so i got this cool idea about like space
5079220	5087780	and rap how's that and they're like what and i'm like yeah are there any are there any there's a
5087780	5094100	lot of amazing stories throughout music history of one person one of the few great artists loving
5094100	5099060	a record uh producers like label people that would stick their necks out and say no we need
5099060	5103220	to we need to make this record because this is going to be important and the top of you know the
5103220	5107460	head of capital records said no nobody wants to buy that shit but it ends up being Dave Brubeck's
5107460	5112260	take time out you know the biggest jazz record of all time that nobody ever wanted to make are
5112260	5117380	there still people that you think do they even exist in the record industry that would stick
5117380	5122180	their necks out and support an artist doing that no just because there's no money in it no it's not
5122180	5126420	that it's like you know who supported me was my manager but he's also my best friend so i'm signed
5126420	5130900	to an independent visionary music group and through that we we did uh we did a partnership
5130900	5135460	with idj which is then which is deaf jam which is then universal is this whole fucking matrix
5136100	5141300	um and and yeah i mean we we had to defy a lot a lot of the odds you know there was a lot of things
5141300	5144580	that they were like yeah we don't want to do this so we don't want to do that and we were like
5144660	5149300	fuck you gonna do it anyway right and we did it and the reason but the reason we had that leverage
5149300	5153620	is because of the things like the mixtapes my man's checking twitter because i'm just kidding
5153620	5159380	i'm joking the moment the moment the guest turned the store to me dan checks right the fuck out
5159380	5165380	nice but no that's obviously that's my luxury i'm sorry i'm visible that i i was checking on
5165380	5169460	our sponsor to see if uh what the fuck we're supposed to say about their product nice
5169460	5176100	i wanted you guys to be doing what you're doing it was good it was a good opportunity for me to
5176100	5180500	look at this i'm sorry i just yes i don't even know what we were talking about we're talking about
5180500	5185620	the album making process yeah um so is your next one can you say is it is it going to be another
5185620	5191060	like thematic it is it is it's boe-esque if you start this journey into there is a huge theme
5191700	5196100	i'm really excited about it i wish i could give you the title now but i can't is it called crumb
5196100	5201540	rumblers because that would be fun now you know what i will give you the title to my next um
5203140	5207860	well well looks like there's a harmontown exclusive here there's a real thing because
5207860	5211300	you know what because everything that we've been talking about i think i think it'd be great and
5211300	5216580	and you know it's not too crazy it's just the title um before i give you the title i want you
5216580	5221540	to know that it is a uh a word uh that i created i formed i formed no it's not that word
5221540	5228900	naz did that um but it's it's it's a it's two words that i put together and basically
5228900	5234740	the definition of it is the cultural evolution of man uh from scientifically proven the first man
5234740	5241620	and woman from africa and then how over time uh culturally evolving into a you know lighter and
5241620	5247540	lighter and much more fairer skin so the album uh is going to be called africarian and it's no
5247540	5252020	real shit and it's about it's about me being black and white and seeing life from from two
5252020	5256500	sides and once again about that cultural evolution and how you can go from the darkest of skin to
5256500	5260260	the lightest of skin or the aryan brotherhood if you will who believe that they're pure of blood
5260260	5265700	when at the end of the fucking day we all have you know that that in our blood and we all have so so
5265700	5270580	many different uh ethnicities in in our blood no matter how pure we think that we are and that at
5270580	5276260	the end of the day life should all be should be about uh peace love and positivity and equality
5276260	5280820	for all every man woman and child that walks the earth and and that's what i'm saying on this
5280820	5288340	entire album i'm gonna buy that record i'm gonna buy that record here here exclusive yeah
5290820	5296420	i definitely i i think what you're saying is that humanity could use a good shave
5300260	5305060	and uh and and and they need to understand that they need to stop thinking that they need to
5305060	5310980	choose between price and quality to get an amazing and affordable shave um that's like
5310980	5317060	legit like that's what the fucking album is yeah exactly that is like exactly what it's

5757460	5761540	there's still more bills to pay but it was it was the idea the general idea of that rap which i
5761540	5768340	think came through is that like price and quality they don't need to compete it's like if if if you
5768340	5774100	know you're a biracial rapper how much are they paying us for this wait no no no how much are
5774180	5781300	they paying me because we're gonna kick start your fourth this next album you've got that

6041620	6046180	i well i mean that's kind of sounds weird but well maybe you need to demonstrate it okay
6046180	6050500	i'm gonna demonstrate how many foods can you say as fast as it's not about foods but it's
6050500	6054660	about description so i have a song called gang related where i'm rapping about my brother
6054660	6058500	and and the things that he went through and a part of it so it goes where he's basically
6058500	6063540	talking about being in the streets but it goes get down or lay down hit you with the beretta you
6063540	6068500	better stay down straight sides at the playground living how i'm living with the life that i'm given
6068500	6072660	anybody that's riding with me i'm riding with them show me the enemy and i'ma hit them the second i
6072660	6076260	bid them i get them and hit them with the venom and don't need to pretend i'ma never do it i
6076260	6080180	knew it already been through it i do it for the street for the fam for the life anybody that's
6080180	6084580	gang related and when i do it on stage i say in one breath get down and lay down hit you with the
6084580	6086980	beretta get better stay down straight shots in the playground living how i'm living with the
6086980	6089300	life that i'm giving anybody that's right i'm with me i'm riding with the show me the enemy and
6089300	6091940	i'ma hit them the second i bid them i get them and hit them with the venom i never do it i knew
6091940	6094500	what i've already been through it i do it for the street for the fam for the life anybody that's
6104500	6111060	shave but logic you logic you uh you brought a knife to a gunfight because you haven't heard
6111060	6120180	dan do chef i'll tell you like i when i talk about oh when i talk about uh life in the streets
6121460	6128900	like one thing that i'll say is i know i know you're a brother but i know another and i have
6128900	6136500	a brother that's another um that doesn't get his druthers because because society is trying to
6136580	6142180	smother the brother that's another with with with that doesn't that doesn't that doesn't get get
6142180	6147620	what he wants but when i'm when i'm on stage sometimes i go a brother with another guy comes
6147620	6154660	you go but then i'll but then i'll stop and go starting over yeah a brother with another
6154660	6159700	second some other yeah i i mean i'm sure when you do it's not it's like so fast yeah that you can't
6159700	6172820	even register a brother but she's so quick micro machines uh i gotta but uh well here's my
6172820	6181140	serious question so when you when you do something like that is that so in that instance are you
6181940	6185700	when you do you think phonetically when you're writing you obviously you must go when you're
6185700	6189620	writing lyrics you go i think this is something a lot of people don't understand
6189620	6196420	that only you and i get is that it's not about like it's that it's not you don't just go like
6196420	6200740	oh i'm gonna rhyme the word milk so then i'm gonna say silk at the end of this actually it's
6200740	6205860	like no so that's like the entire time so i yes i studied uh i studied obviously like
6206420	6212580	the dictionary and the thesaurus as a kid so you know it's just like um like living given you know
6212580	6217540	just like these words that that's jeremy piven jeremy piven you know what i mean but there's but
6217540	6221540	there's a difference between just saying some shit so i used to i i have this thing where i i
6221540	6225460	kind of have fun with it so basically that's a real thing you guys heard me say it and it's
6225460	6230020	kind of depicting this you know street lifestyle that this that this guy is living and i'm
6230020	6234660	preaching to not live that way and and not have to deal with that but then there's fun ones so
6234660	6239460	like i could do little freestyles and be like yo what's l-o-g-i-c chilling in l-a from m-d the
6239460	6243540	second i get it you know who we be right and then there at the end i'll end it and be like
6243540	6247780	because i'm ripping and living like like almost like some jack the river i said i'm ripping and
6247780	6251460	living and striving the killer the ripper he's calling what goes when he flow and this is where
6251460	6255140	it's all just kind of syllable and just fun calling what go when he flow and you know he's pursuing
6255140	6259380	it doing it moving it grooving it stopping it right like oh like just kind of flexing and having fun
6259380	6262900	but when i say it back really fast it's just ripping it a little bit it's dropping a little
6262900	6265060	rippy calling what going flowing you know he pursuing it doing it moving it grooving it
6265060	6267060	stopping the rocket it's talking to walk it up flipping it ripping the motherfucker screwing
6267060	6269940	it i'm ready to go and i buy it then break it roll it then lick it and smoke it choke on it later
6270420	6274580	but what this is it's like a roulette wheel yeah totally it's like price is right
6276020	6281700	a bike that's fun because like me it's it's almost like solving a rubik's cube so like next
6281700	6285460	time hopefully i can come and i'll do it but it's all about algorithms it's like muscle memory or
6285460	6292740	playing the drums it's super fun it's about logic anyway so so but what you do is you just
6292740	6296900	you memorize this and you just do it over and over and over and so when you are on stage and
6296900	6301620	you are performing you know i i slaved away on that gang related verse the first one that
6301620	6305700	i did that is a real thing that i did this one's just like jerking off you know this one's just
6305700	6309700	like all these people who have no idea i'm just like yeah rip it a little bit and i'm taking these
6309700	6313700	fun words and putting them together but they're like oh my god so it's like cheating but but
6313700	6317460	that's for fun though i actually do it right but that's just like the fun but not cheating at all
6317460	6324020	because your your listener is going wow he talks fast like like is that you're talking about like
6324020	6328900	oh but to add meaning into that to add a narrative and then you're talking when you're jerking off
6328900	6333300	you're doing like well this word and that word are yeah just i'm still i'm still i'm still forming
6333300	6337860	sentences but it's more fun you know like even the bracket you ever do one that's super fast
6337860	6341620	but you're just actually like talking shit about somebody they don't know it like you're like you
6341620	6347940	or just like say some like real satanic shit no i don't think so like riveter wrote a shave brave
6348740	6352100	well this is what i wanted you is where is that what it's called shave brave
6352100	6357700	dollar shave oh dollar shave brave is shave brave i think i think that's a new auto
6357700	6362420	bot from transformer be brave to shave shave brave wait what the fuck is it called again
6362420	6367860	get over to those shave brave dollar shave club dollar shave club dot com slash harmontown so let
6367860	6373060	me ask you a question real quick if you if this if this person like this this company they sponsor
6373060	6378020	you but you like can you like make fun of them are you allowed to do that i think we're about to
6378020	6385380	find out they'll either be back or they won't i i don't know if we offended me on the dollar
6385380	6390180	shave club that is like that's like the first rule of dollar shave club we just totally fuck
6390180	6394180	that up yeah but i think the beauty of the new world is it's like well there's always going to
6394180	6399540	be it's like it's more of a buyer's market in the sense of like you know hey there'll be another
6399540	6406740	shave club hey if it's if it's if it's a dynamic industry hey can i just say that i was like super
6406740	6412100	nervous to come out here and no i'm serious i was so nervous man because like this isn't this isn't
6412100	6419460	like this isn't my my your jam the kids say go ahead let me teach you some street culture
6419460	6426820	it's not your jam what jam what it comes it's not my jam oh yeah it's uh it's it comes from jelly
6427620	6433780	sandwiches like this isn't my jam but yes i uh this isn't my jam like this is kind of you know
6433780	6438340	this is like fun and and and you know and comedic and also i i do want to just say that i appreciate
6438340	6443460	you kind of like let me talk about um you know some more serious stuff as well but to everybody
6443460	6447700	in the crowd uh who might not know me i i just want to say thank you so much for even like sitting
6447700	6451220	through this and and you know and i i really appreciate it and this is fucking awesome and i
6451220	6456820	hope maybe just maybe muscle that i can come back oh yeah absolutely you should come back all the
6456820	6465300	time but i think we should conclude with this is what i was getting at earlier i was like
6465300	6470500	our lives are intersecting i need to when we go to the moon and you did the sci-fi rap thing it's
6470500	6476180	about exodus from the earth and stuff so i think like you could help us create like a harmontown
6476180	6482820	anthem that should probably be hip hop what it's like we'll close with that and then we'll go
6482820	6488420	this is not gonna go well but i think it will because well let me ask you real quick damn
6488420	6492660	to cut you off what you said you're nervous to come out here but are you nervous when you go
6492660	6497380	on stage at the forum what's that 40 000 people what do you got there wasn't 40 000 but you know
6497380	6501300	some of the shows we did they were like 20 000 yeah are you nervous when you go on and do your
6501300	6505380	own thing or you not really if you're prepared if i haven't done it in three months and then i'm
6505380	6508980	you know i have like a one-off show or a festival i get like oh man i'm excited but as soon as i
6508980	6513220	touch the stage i'm like it goes away but this is different but it's not a bad thing it's actually
6513220	6517380	really nice because there's less and less things since not to sound any type of way but like
6517380	6522420	you know like the last time this is crazy the last time i felt how i felt like sitting back
6522420	6527220	there it was when i performed on jimmy fallon with the roots for nine million viewers and it's
6527220	6531300	because i performed so many times in front of so many people and this and that that like i'm used
6531300	6536740	to that performing on television was crazy doing this like you know i i you know i watched and i
6536740	6541300	was telling dan this like i wasn't really hip to all of this obviously i knew i knew dan and i
6541300	6545380	love rick and morty and i know community and you know all these different things but i didn't really
6545380	6549060	know about this world and i did my homework and i watched fucking harmotown i watched documentary
6549060	6554900	i watched everything and then i got real scared like oh shit i can't fuck this up you know and
6554900	6559860	so it's just in the meantime i'm diligently listening to all your albums yeah yeah totally
6559860	6566100	i came so prepared uh but yeah i know i think they would i mean i i i know that you are like
6566100	6572420	cut out for podcasting like you should be because it's just a like your cup runs over jesus i'm drunk
6572420	6581060	um you should you you you you have leftovers you're practicing a craft on stage and on your
6581060	6585540	albums you're putting those things together meticulously but and it's not a waste of all
6585540	6593140	of the the you know when you're 80 years old and you're a hologram like if you want to avoid
6593140	6597780	going like oh shit man i was chugging and chugging and chugging and how much of that smoke went into
6597780	6604820	albums and things that i took so preciously it's like you're fun to listen to just having coffee
6604820	6608900	so that's what podcasting is like i've thought about it i've really thought about starting
