0	2460	Well, I love you. That's why I'm here today.
2460	3460	Here we go.
3460	6340	So anyways, yeah, that's a Rob Tancham jam.
6340	9100	Now clap your hands if you're always sad
9100	11680	And you know there's something wrong with you
11680	14940	Now move your feet in the air and it's nothing to do with you
14940	17520	In the world-famous San Francisco Sketchfest
17520	20860	Here at the Memorial Marines Auditorium
20860	22680	Carmentown is now in session.
22680	26820	I love you, don't you, it's so cool to be here
26820	27520	A lot of that
27580	30280	Give it up for your game master, Spencer Crittenden
41660	43360	Thank you, thank you.
44860	50200	Also give it up for your deputy district attorney, Rob Strahd, is here tonight.
58520	62180	And the mayor of Carmentown is Dan Harmon!
66180	72760	Thank you, I'm sorry, thank you, I'm sorry, thank you, very sorry, thank you, so sorry.
75420	78260	Master of apologies, I'm so sorry.
78260	86100	It's so good to be back here. I love San Francisco obviously, but more importantly, we love the Marine Memorial Theater.
86160	90720	Yeah, a casino, hotel, and water park.
90720	97060	I probably expressed this last time, is my mic too hot? That's fine, right?
97060	101060	No, that's not an answer to my question.
104060	107700	Folks, I'm sorry for everything.
107700	109800	It sounds good to me, is it good for you guys out there?
110800	119800	But if I go like this, that's if I want to do like a Richard Pryor joke where I'm like, you're going on the street and you see the guy and he's like, what are you doing, son?
119800	124800	Okay, I'll save that character for later.
124800	136800	But yeah, I'm just worried about, when I hear the word marine and memorial, I think of the ghost of my grandfather who lied about his age to fight fascists
136800	150800	and who is watching me in my 45th year of life with his arms folded, a cigarette dangling from his lips in a costume designed by the Dunkirk creators.
150800	158800	And it's just going like, when are you ever going to get off your ass and stop these fucking Nazis?
158800	170800	Like, I was 16, I lied about my age for the privilege of storming Normandy and you joined an improv troupe at 30.
170800	174800	You are such a fucking shameful lump of fat.
174800	178800	When did he tell you that he lied about his age?
178800	180800	Well, my grandma told me, I don't know.
180800	181800	When?
181800	182800	What do you mean when?
182800	187800	Depositioning my fucking dead grandpa?
187800	188800	Where's this going?
188800	190800	You think he didn't lie about his age?
190800	191800	You think he's lying about lying about his age?
191800	193800	It seemed like you're hiding something.
193800	196800	You're distracting from the issues that people want to hear.
196800	199800	I want to see a receipt about your lie.
199800	201800	That's what we're alleging.
201800	205800	I'm going to shut down Harmantown until we get to the bottom so we can strike a deal.
205800	207800	We're shutting down Harmantown.
207800	209800	Was it like Christmas? Was it birthday?
209800	213800	And he goes, I have a confession to make, Danny.
213800	215800	I have a confession to make.
215800	219800	I wasn't 18. I wasn't 18.
219800	220800	I have a confession.
220800	221800	He never confessed to me.
221800	224800	I don't have that power.
224800	228800	That's knowledge that was handed down from our family.
228800	231800	I just wanted some backstory.
231800	239800	Anyways, it's good to be back in the Marine Memorial Theater, if that's what it's called, in San Francisco.
239800	240800	You know what's great here?
240800	243800	If you stay at the hotel here, which I have several times, and it's lovely,
243800	245800	and the people here are great.
245800	247800	The towels in there, most of the towels are white.
247800	249800	These towels here, they're kind of like...
249800	253800	They have little guns on them.
253800	258800	They're kind of like peach, mauvey, kind of beigey peach colored.
258800	260800	Like your grandpa's or grandma's.
260800	263800	They're storming themselves.
263800	266800	They're Marine towels. They're not...
266800	269800	From the balls of Montezuma...
269800	272800	To the cheeks of Triple H.
272800	279800	We will dry your entire body.
279800	281800	We are Marine Memorial towels.
281800	284800	I don't think from the balls of Montezuma landed as hard as that should have.
284800	291800	I thought that was a pretty solid Marine testicle joke.
291800	293800	Yeah.
293800	297800	By the way, there's no show tonight. I don't have anything.
297800	298800	But I do.
298800	302800	This is the first Harman Town show we've had with an audience.
302800	304800	In a while.
304800	307800	So I don't want you to be punished.
307800	310800	There's probably more important stuff for you guys to be at.
310800	313800	You paid money for tickets and I have nothing but shame.
313800	315800	Where are the empty seats?
315800	318800	That was the first thing I thought.
318800	321800	There's way too many empty seats.
321800	327800	This is the bottom row. God knows what the balcony looks like.
328800	331800	How's my balcony doing?
331800	333800	Oh, yeah.
333800	335800	Strop got into the audience.
335800	337800	This will work out great.
337800	341800	We've been famously sold out for weeks and there's seats everywhere.
341800	343800	There's a bunch of seats.
343800	348800	Yeah, move it down. I don't give a shit.
348800	353800	Everybody move over one seat.
354800	356800	All right.
356800	359800	We have a great show for you tonight.
359800	361800	I promise you that.
361800	363800	Prove it. Prove it.
365800	366800	Uh-oh.
366800	369800	I think we have a heckler in the front row, Dan.
369800	370800	Just ignore him.
370800	371800	Prove it.
371800	372800	No.
372800	374800	I do have one...
377800	380800	Strob is feeding back.
381800	384800	I'm sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead.
384800	387800	Go ahead. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
387800	392800	I was going to try to stay sober for this show, but I think I'm going to start drinking now.
392800	396800	For people who are going to be listening to this as an audio package,
396800	401800	why is that tiny microphone-sized speaker even there?
401800	406800	It seems exclusively designed for him to do that.
407800	413800	Rob showed up her two weeks ago to totally outrig this entire theater
413800	416800	with audio equipment jokes.
416800	418800	No, he's...
422800	424800	Somebody shut off my mic.
424800	426800	That was the sound of Rob getting back on stage.
426800	427800	Oh, God.
427800	431800	How did you know that wasn't going to make a horrible ear-piercing screech
431800	433800	that would make everybody bummed out?
433800	436800	Well, I was hoping it would.
438800	440800	That could have been a nightmare.
440800	443800	Hey, do you forget who you're dealing with?
446800	448800	I have this voice!
451800	454800	Your piercing is my deal.
454800	456800	Your whole life is feedback.
457800	459800	It's like asking Ed Gein,
459800	462800	how did you know your mom's head wouldn't start talking to you
462800	464800	when you placed it at the foot of your bed?
464800	466800	All right, all right.
467800	470800	Too soon and or too regional.
471800	473800	I'm from Wisconsin.
476800	477800	Wow.
477800	480800	Let's spend the next 20 minutes recovering from that.
480800	483800	Of all the metaphors I could have used, I'm so sorry.
483800	485800	I don't think it was temporal or regional.
485800	487800	I think it was just fucking...
487800	488800	Bad metaphor?
488800	492800	Well, I thought they were on my side for one second, but...
492800	498800	I have one thing in my Bare Notes app.
498800	501800	Bare Notes is interesting. It's tag-cloud based.
501800	502800	You should check it out.
502800	507800	It's a Notes app for kind of hairier, bigger homosexuals, right?
510800	513800	Why does that fly here?
514800	515800	And my...
518800	523800	I can't win for a loser.
523800	528800	I made a joke that should have only offended three people from Plainfield, Wisconsin.
529800	531800	Stop capping the microphones.
531800	533800	What is he doing?
533800	535800	He wants you to say hello...
535800	537800	Rob, scoot your stool forward.
537800	539800	Rob, I flew you out here.
539800	542800	Yeah, yeah. I don't know why you did either.
542800	549800	You were like, you want to go? And I'm like, okay, sure.
549800	551800	You know what's going to happen.
551800	555800	Because you seemed sad, and I wanted to make you happy.
555800	559800	I didn't know making you happy would make me sad.
559800	561800	That's not fair.
561800	565800	What am I, the green mile guy? I'm just sucking up your sadness, and then I'm going to...
565800	566800	Yeah.
566800	569800	Now, you grown that?!
570800	572800	We made a bear joke!
572800	577800	That's a fictional guy from a movie from 20 years ago!
577800	581800	You're offended by everything I do! I accept it.
581800	583800	I am sorry.
583800	585800	I am the master of apologies.
585800	588800	I want to hear, we all want to hear, what's on your California hair better app.
588800	593800	I have one grievance. I have one airline grievance left.
593800	598800	Everyone that listens to the podcast knows I fly around.
598800	602800	I have a million airline grievances. I have one airline grievance.
602800	606800	I don't like airlines. They're terrible.
606800	608800	I'm not going to waste your time with that.
608800	612800	You know, you're San Franciscans. You're leftists. You're socialists.
612800	617800	You know airlines are a cartel. You know they're garbage people.
617800	620800	But now let's zoom in.
620800	622800	On the food, right?
622800	626800	You hear about this airline food?
627800	629800	It's not airline food.
629800	634800	I mean, the peanuts, they don't even give you the peanuts anymore.
634800	637800	Why do they call it airlines?
641800	643800	When they...
643800	646800	clearly...
646800	650800	Virgin Atlantic, Virgin America, whatever the fuck.
650800	654800	Now it's a subsidiary of Alaska.
654800	658800	They're a subsidiary of Kleenex. I don't know.
658800	661800	They're very groovy. I applaud it.
661800	663800	Oh, God. I know where this is going.
663800	665800	Because tonight you're going to fly right.
665800	668800	We're going to make Virgin all right.
668800	671800	When you fly, I'm going to fly.
671800	675800	Compared to every other airline that tries to make their seat.
675800	676800	We're going to fly.
676800	679800	We're going to live it all up in the sky.
679800	680800	I hate that.
680800	682800	I don't like it. I don't like it.
682800	685800	I did it already.
685800	688800	For the zero zero zero point one percent of views.
688800	691800	That's what I'm talking about. Don't steal my complete thunder.
691800	692800	That's what I'm talking about.
692800	694800	That's the one part.
694800	698800	Me and Greg Poops get up and dance to it with the flight attendants now.
698800	700800	We start doing a little music video.
700800	701800	It's when the person says...
701800	704800	Aren't you supposed to stay in your seat?
704800	705800	You're getting up and dancing?
705800	706800	Don't get ahead of Dan.
706800	708800	It's when the person says...
708800	709800	Continue.
709800	716800	To the point zero zero zero one percent of you that have never operated a seat belt.
716800	719800	Really?
719800	720800	Here's my problem.
720800	722800	This is a comedy writer.
722800	723800	Break that down.
723800	724800	Take a scalpel.
724800	725800	Cut it in half.
725800	728800	This is what we call a sock barrel in comedy rooms.
728800	733800	Like she could have said to the point zero zero one percent of you that have never operated a seat belt
733800	738800	and then continued and it might have been funny.
738800	745800	Also, she could have said to those of you that have never operated the seat belt
745800	746800	really?
746800	748800	And it might have been funny.
748800	753800	Saying to the point zero zero one percent of you that have never operated a seat belt
753800	761800	ostensibly you're asking the audience to lean in with the point zero zero one percent of their heart
761800	767800	that is naturally predisposed to identify with the underdog.
767800	774800	Whether these people know it or not, you're leaning in and then she kicks you in the nuts.
774800	776800	Really?
776800	779800	And you're like, my nuts were pre-kicked.
779800	781800	Hat on a hat.
781800	782800	Look it up.
782800	783800	Okay, Dan.
783800	784800	It doesn't matter.
784800	788800	That airline's now dead ostensibly because maybe they treated their customers well.
788800	789800	I don't know.
789800	792800	I used to enjoy traveling by Virgin.
792800	794800	JetBlue is now property of Clorox.
794800	795800	I don't know.
795800	796800	It doesn't matter.
796800	801800	You guys are like, Dan, please, let's come to a marine memorial theater.
801800	814800	Why don't we hear your fucking quibbles about your first class travel?
814800	817800	That's called stagecraft, you guys.
817800	819800	But here's the thing, man.
819800	822800	When we travel by airplane, we're all in the same position.
822800	828800	We're all being forced by a weird something-something complex to force it.
828800	830800	I've got to read my child's key.
830800	831800	Dan, here's the thing.
831800	834800	I feel like we've talked about this before, but here's the difference.
834800	835800	All right, noted.
835800	836800	And you're not going to like this.
836800	838800	You're not going to like any part of this.
838800	844800	You've only heard that song in first class where you don't get to see the video that goes along with it.
844800	848800	You don't need to see her going like this to get that joke.
848800	852800	The cartoon character feels like a moose sitting next to a squirrel.
852800	856800	And on the cartoon version of it, you watch.
856800	864800	It's less offensive when you see the power dynamic of the two characters saying that to each other.
864800	873800	But you've only heard that from your closeted bullshit, rich Sony NBC cable.
873800	874800	What do you want to know?
874800	875800	I don't know.
875800	877800	Yeah, I don't know either.
877800	878800	Yeah, keep abusing me.
878800	881800	Everybody keeps shoveling me down into a ditch.
881800	882800	Like, oh, you're so privileged.
882800	884800	I'm privileged to death.
884800	886800	Yeah, I'm saying.
886800	890800	Do you know how hard it is to be privileged?
890800	893800	Have you ever stopped to think about it?
893800	896800	Oh, I wonder what it's like to be privileged.
896800	898800	You never think about it.
898800	901800	Hashtag me.
907800	923800	All right.
923800	926800	That should conclude the portion of the show.
926800	928800	Let's start the show.
928800	930800	I want to tell you guys a story.
930800	931800	Hello.
931800	932800	You're seeing Franciscans.
932800	933800	Hello.
933800	938800	Hello.
938800	944800	You guys live at the epicenter of hate and ash for man, I remember.
944800	948800	You hear where the hippie thing started in the 1960s or something.
948800	958800	The first bra was burnt at the corner of two blocks on 203 North Haight and the corner of Ashbury North.
958800	961800	And this city's always had a weird relationship.
961800	962800	It's a counterculture.
962800	967800	And then it's such a nice place to live that the yuppies move in and they overtake and all this shit.
967800	970800	And most recently, oh, Silicon Valley.
970800	971800	Oh, God, Jesus Christ.
971800	972800	Oh, these people.
972800	973800	These computer programmers.
973800	976800	Some of them are here among us.
976800	981800	I moved here because I want this poor person's apartment.
981800	987800	How much money can I pay for it to shove them out with money?
987800	990800	And it's not their money, but they're just being shoved out by money.
991800	992800	And we don't know where they go.
992800	993800	Oakland.
993800	994800	I don't know.
998800	999800	Oakland.
1002800	1004800	Give it up for Oakland.
1004800	1005800	But then.
1005800	1008800	What the lucky number is 911.
1008800	1016800	But the intersection between those roads, like the smart people whose buses you visit Goss block,
1016800	1019800	you're going like, your bus will not pass.
1019800	1024800	And the people inside those buses going, look, I came here from Thailand.
1024800	1027800	I don't know what's going on.
1027800	1033800	It all intersects with innovation and the human spirit and the individual triumph.
1037800	1039800	I want to tell you a story.
1039800	1040800	Wait.
1040800	1041800	I thought you were.
1041800	1042800	I am.
1042800	1043800	I am.
1043800	1044800	Okay.
1044800	1045800	All right.
1045800	1046800	I just wanted to remind them.
1046800	1047800	Okay.
1047800	1048800	Right.
1049800	1053800	There was once upon a time, there was a man.
1053800	1058800	And I know that already makes it less marketable story.
1059800	1061800	But that's the truth.
1061800	1067800	There was a man who was a trumpet enthusiast and he.
1067800	1069800	Well, a brass enthusiast.
1069800	1075800	Well, a brass enthusiast, which made him by default a trumpet enthusiast.
1075800	1076800	Right.
1077800	1078800	You can interrupt any time you want.
1078800	1079800	It's fine.
1079800	1080800	I'm not.
1080800	1081800	Oh, is it fine?
1081800	1082800	This is what fine is.
1082800	1083800	Is that okay?
1083800	1085800	Is it all right?
1085800	1086800	Anytime?
1087800	1090800	I think it's time to me.
1094800	1097800	It's not even making sound.
1097800	1098800	What does he do?
1098800	1099800	This is insane.
1099800	1102800	I feel like Jane Goodall.
1103800	1111800	I feel like I'm trying to just get everyone to have tea with me and then I'll be like
1111800	1112800	touched down.
1112800	1113800	I thought you were setting me up.
1113800	1114800	I thought you were setting me up.
1114800	1122800	Once upon a time, there was a guy who was such a brass enthusiast that he's like,
1122800	1126800	I want to share my brass enthusiasm with the world.
1126800	1128800	And this new technology comes along.
1128800	1130800	Oh, you can make apps.
1130800	1132800	And he goes, you know what?
1132800	1136800	I want everyone to learn the glory of the trumpet.
1136800	1142800	And I'm going to make an app and I'm going to call it iTrump because iTrumpet is too
1142800	1144800	long.
1144800	1150800	And then a guy started suing him in 2011 named Donald Trump.
1150800	1157800	And long story short, but let's hear the rest of the story.
1157800	1164800	This man, Donald Trump, spent a total of something like half a decade trying to intimidate
1164800	1170800	and sue this guy into non-existence, just trying to get him to stop calling his app
1170800	1173800	about trumpets, iTrump.
1173800	1178800	This guy represented himself in court and beat him and won.
1180800	1182800	Please welcome Tom Scharfeld.
1182800	1183800	Yeah.
1187800	1192800	The San Francisco spirit embodied.
1196800	1197800	I don't know.
1197800	1200800	Was that a good introduction or was that too weird?
1200800	1201800	Amazing introduction.
1201800	1203800	Only introduction I've ever gotten in my life.
1203800	1204800	Can we help you out?
1204800	1205800	You don't want to do that all.
1205800	1206800	Yeah.
1206800	1208800	Can we lower your stool?
1209800	1216800	But yeah, I mean, I'm getting your story sloppy.
1216800	1218800	There are parts that are very fascinating about it.
1218800	1221800	First of all, you got to hit it.
1226800	1228800	It's intimidating, I have to say.
1228800	1235800	My favorite part of it is that you're not, who's the most, you're not Herb Alpert.
1235800	1237800	That's a famous trumpet guy, right?
1237800	1238800	I know.
1238800	1239800	He's a fantastic trumpet guy.
1239800	1241800	You never said that you were.
1241800	1243800	I'm the best trumpet player in the world.
1243800	1248800	You have an app called iBone for trombone.
1252800	1254800	You're laughing, but it's a serious app.
1254800	1255800	I'm not laughing.
1255800	1256800	They laughed.
1256800	1258800	But they also applaud because they love you.
1258800	1259800	I'm a trombone player.
1259800	1261800	I've been playing trombone my whole life.
1261800	1262800	Well, you got to eat that mic.
1262800	1263800	Imagine it's a trombone.
1263800	1264800	I've been playing trombone.
1264800	1265800	I'm an instrument.
1265800	1267800	I'm a trombone player for the record.
1267800	1271800	And I've been playing pretty much my whole life.
1271800	1273800	But Miles Davis is one of my big idols.
1273800	1276800	So I love trumpet.
1276800	1278800	He's like the Herb Alpert of trumpet players.
1278800	1279800	I like Herb Alpert as well.
1279800	1282800	Sorry, you guys don't realize Miles Davis was just outed,
1282800	1285800	called out yesterday on a different podcast.
1285800	1290800	So what was the original question?
1290800	1291800	Continue.
1291800	1292800	Sorry.
1293800	1295800	I'm being a petty vandal.
1295800	1297800	I'm angry.
1297800	1298800	Go ahead.
1298800	1299800	Okay, no.
1299800	1303800	Could you remind you of what we were talking about?
1303800	1304800	Yeah, no.
1304800	1307800	You had an iBone app.
1307800	1308800	I'm not being aloof.
1308800	1310800	I'm pulling up your app.
1310800	1311800	Okay, okay.
1311800	1313800	Yeah, so iBone was my first iPhone app.
1313800	1315800	It was really an experiment, but it was something that I knew
1315800	1317800	because I had been playing trombone my whole life.
1317800	1319800	And I launched, you know, I worked on it for a few months
1319800	1320800	and got it out.
1321800	1324800	This was back in 2009, launched it, and it was success.
1324800	1325800	You know, I got some good feedback,
1325800	1329800	and then I got to work on a trumpet pretty much right away.
1329800	1330800	And, you know, a lot of work designing it,
1330800	1332800	trying to get the interface right.
1332800	1334800	So I was trying to make something playable and intuitive
1334800	1335800	for real players.
1335800	1337800	You know, something you could actually use as a practice
1337800	1338800	to unlearn from.
1338800	1342800	And so the trombone was your favorite thing.
1342800	1344800	You felt like you nailed it, and then you're like,
1344800	1346800	I'm going to move on to the other instrument.
1346800	1347800	Right.
1347800	1348800	So I'll call it iTrump.
1348800	1349800	This is 2011.
1349800	1350800	Right.
1350800	1352800	So then something comes in the mail.
1352800	1355800	Yeah, so pretty much I launched it.
1355800	1358800	And maybe I can provide some soundtrack for this story.
1358800	1359800	Yes.
1360800	1361800	Yeah.
1361800	1364800	So launched it in January 2011.
1368800	1371800	For those of you listening, I'm providing that soundtrack
1371800	1373800	with this amazing $2 app.
1373800	1375800	Yeah, it's not a real trumpet game.
1375800	1376800	$2.99.
1377800	1381800	I'm very, very affordable compared
1381800	1383800	to the price of fascism.
1384800	1385800	Sorry.
1385800	1386800	Yeah.
1386800	1387800	Continue.
1387800	1388800	So I launched it at the NAMM show.
1388800	1389800	I don't know if you know the NAMM show.
1389800	1392800	It's a big music merchandising show in Anaheim.
1392800	1394800	We're all very familiar with it.
1394800	1395800	Yeah.
1397800	1399800	It's the biggest trade show in Anaheim,
1399800	1401800	but 80,000 people or something.
1401800	1402800	So anyway.
1402800	1403800	You don't have to sell it.
1403800	1404800	It was a good launch.
1404800	1405800	It was a good launch.
1405800	1407800	After two years into a good launch, it was in USA Today.
1407800	1410800	And then two weeks later, I got a cease and desist letter
1410800	1412800	from Donald Trump.
1412800	1417800	And Anansa, well, I got the letter.
1418800	1419800	All right.
1419800	1420800	So you get the letter, and it says,
1420800	1423800	stop calling your app iTrump.
1423800	1424800	Right.
1425800	1430800	My boss, I'm a lawyer from Dewey, Cheetham, and Howe.
1430800	1431800	Right.
1432800	1436800	I stop calling it iTrump.
1436800	1438800	You know there's only one Trump,
1438800	1440800	and anyone that's ever going to call something iTrump
1440800	1443800	is the big, big buster himself.
1443800	1444800	Right.
1444800	1445800	Okay.
1445800	1446800	So you read that letter.
1446800	1447800	Right.
1447800	1449800	And he claimed he had some computer games,
1449800	1450800	and he claimed that...
1450800	1452800	He claimed he had computer games?
1452800	1453800	Yeah.
1453800	1454800	And iPhone apps.
1454800	1457800	And he claimed that I was trading off of Goodwill
1457800	1458800	that he had generated.
1459800	1461800	He thought you were riding on the back
1461800	1465800	of the popularity of Donald Trump in 2011
1465800	1467800	with your app about Trumpets.
1467800	1468800	Yes, yes.
1468800	1470800	And he claimed that, you know...
1470800	1471800	Oh, sorry.
1471800	1472800	Trumpets known as...
1476800	1479800	So yeah, he claimed that it's known as a horn
1479800	1480800	and not a Trump.
1480800	1482800	And so anyway, I...
1484800	1486800	That's their argument?
1486800	1487800	That was it.
1488800	1489800	That was it.
1489800	1490800	Yeah.
1490800	1493800	The instrument you're describing is not called a Trump.
1494800	1495800	My boss is called a Trump.
1495800	1496800	It's known as a horn.
1496800	1497800	Okay.
1497800	1499800	Anyway, basically all brass instruments are known as horns.
1499800	1502800	Anyway, so I got the letter,
1502800	1504800	and I honestly thought it was...
1504800	1505800	It felt like some kind of...
1505800	1507800	You know, it felt like April Fool's or something.
1507800	1508800	So I actually...
1508800	1511800	I saw it on my phone, and I laid down on my bed
1511800	1513800	and pulled the computer up just, you know,
1513800	1515800	to take some time to read it.
1515800	1518800	And then the first thing I did was to actually go
1518800	1521800	to the lawyer's webpage to make sure it was legitimate,
1521800	1522800	like a real firm.
1522800	1524800	You thought it might be your friend from college.
1524800	1525800	No, I mean, honestly, I...
1525800	1526800	Fucking with you.
1528800	1530800	Completely out of this world.
1530800	1531800	It was...
1531800	1533800	So I wasn't afraid, right?
1533800	1535800	I was really just more shocked, right?
1535800	1538800	I mean, you know, it just didn't seem real, right?
1538800	1540800	At this point, I just want to interject.
1540800	1541800	How is your...
1541800	1544800	Is your eyebone money, like, keeping you afloat?
1544800	1546800	Like, are you...
1546800	1548800	I just want to get a sense of, like,
1548800	1551800	are you in a one-bedroom apartment, a two-bedroom apartment?
1551800	1553800	Are you married?
1553800	1555800	Are you a trust fund guy?
1555800	1556800	Are you...
1556800	1559800	You know, we want to feel your protagonist.
1559800	1563800	So I started doing apps, like, when I was 29, 30.
1563800	1567800	And I had saved up money, you know, before.
1567800	1570800	And then I started working on some different projects
1570800	1572800	which didn't make a lot of money.
1572800	1575800	I've only made, you know, some money, you know?
1575800	1576800	And...
1576800	1577800	But it's volatile, you know?
1577800	1578800	It doesn't just last.
1578800	1580800	You have to continue to develop and to promote it.
1580800	1583800	You weren't sitting on a war chest that you could go into litigation with.
1583800	1584800	No, I'm not sitting on a war chest.
1584800	1585800	No.
1585800	1586800	No one here is sitting on a war chest.
1586800	1587800	No, I'm not sitting on a war chest.
1587800	1590800	But I really believe in my products, you know?
1590800	1592800	And I really have, you know...
1592800	1593800	Got to hope for you.
1593800	1594800	And dreams.
1594800	1595800	This is why I love you.
1595800	1596800	This is why you're a hero.
1596800	1597800	Okay.
1597800	1599800	Because you're passionate about fucking brass instruments.
1599800	1600800	Yeah, well...
1601800	1603800	Which is the opposite of Donald Trump,
1603800	1605800	and he's not passionate about anything.
1605800	1608800	So I worked on products that I haven't been that passionate about,
1608800	1611800	and when I started working on projects that I was passionate about,
1611800	1614800	it was like, you know, it was something amazing.
1614800	1617800	What are the products you weren't passionate about?
1617800	1619800	I mean, I...
1619800	1620800	You know what?
1620800	1621800	You don't want to hear about it.
1621800	1622800	Well, he...
1622800	1624800	I mean, maybe we die...
1624800	1625800	Yeah, I mean...
1625800	1627800	I sell it just one.
1628800	1631800	Well, I mean, the one I did immediately prior to I-Bone
1631800	1634800	was a service called Whoop Tones.
1634800	1635800	Whoop Tones?
1635800	1637800	Oh, that sounds familiar.
1637800	1639800	And I loved Whoop.
1639800	1641800	I was passionate about it for a while,
1641800	1644800	but then the meaning wasn't there, you know?
1647800	1649800	So the product, what it did was...
1649800	1651800	Sometimes the spark goes out, sometimes.
1651800	1653800	It was basically pre-smartphone.
1653800	1655800	It allowed you to call people
1655800	1658800	and play sound effects during the phone call, and...
1658800	1660800	I like that already.
1660800	1661800	You can't do that now.
1661800	1663800	It was a fun...
1663800	1665800	You know, I could...
1665800	1666800	Like a soundboard.
1666800	1668800	I could call Jeff and go like,
1668800	1671800	hey, man, do you want to hang out and then press a button?
1671800	1673800	Yeah, so you could...
1673800	1674800	Exactly, yeah.
1674800	1677800	So the slogan was...
1677800	1680800	It was, Whoop Tones, press one to fart, was the slogan.
1680800	1682800	That's the slogan of the company?
1682800	1684800	Whoop Tones, press one to fart.
1684800	1685800	Right.
1685800	1686800	Okay.
1686800	1690800	But you could actually take the sounds and...
1690800	1691800	You are...
1691800	1693800	That's from 2005.
1693800	1694800	It was launched in 2005.
1694800	1695800	It's still online.
1695800	1697800	These are 2005 farts, Dan.
1697800	1700800	Are you picking up emotionally on the fact that you are the hero
1700800	1703800	that we've always wanted?
1706800	1707800	But anyway, you could play scenes, too.
1707800	1711800	You know, backgrounds that would loop to create the impression you're elsewhere.
1711800	1712800	You could do that, too.
1713800	1716800	Oh, so you could do a foggy harbor in London.
1716800	1717800	Yeah.
1717800	1719800	Like, hey, I can't make it to work.
1719800	1721800	My ship is...
1721800	1724800	Paddington is lost, and I'm trying to find him.
1724800	1727800	How about you have typewriters and people talking?
1727800	1728800	Honey, I can right now.
1728800	1731800	I've got a big story coming out right now.
1731800	1732800	It's in there.
1732800	1733800	That's one of them.
1733800	1734800	It's the office.
1734800	1735800	Okay.
1735800	1737800	But anyway, I worked on it for two years,
1737800	1741800	and I just really didn't get anywhere.
1742800	1745800	So I started to lose the passion for it,
1745800	1748800	and part of it was the meaning for me wasn't there.
1748800	1752800	It wasn't something I could go back to my childhood and latch onto.
1752800	1754800	But the trombone was.
1754800	1756800	Is that what you played when you were in school?
1756800	1757800	It sounds crazy.
1757800	1758800	Was that your first instrument in school?
1758800	1759800	Yeah, yeah.
1759800	1762800	My idols, Miles Davis, J.J. Johnson, trombone player.
1762800	1765800	But it's something that really meant something,
1765800	1769800	and so if I could do something for those kids or the ex-players
1769800	1771800	that are the seniors and whatever.
1771800	1774800	Kids deprived of music budgets in their school.
1774800	1775800	So the meaning was there.
1775800	1776800	And is there a market?
1776800	1779800	I didn't know, but it was an experiment.
1779800	1780800	It was a way to learn how to build an app.
1780800	1782800	It was my first app.
1782800	1786800	But because I knew what the trombone was,
1786800	1788800	I knew how I would design it immediately.
1788800	1790800	It was just about trying to figure out how to build the app.
1790800	1794800	But when I started to get good feedback, I just kept on going.
1794800	1795800	Yeah.
1795800	1797800	So you're like, yeah.
1797800	1801800	The iBone didn't make you a billionaire.
1801800	1802800	Not a billionaire.
1802800	1804800	It gave you an emotional cue that you're like,
1804800	1807800	I should keep following this path of bliss.
1807800	1809800	I am going to now do the iTrump.
1809800	1811800	So I could see a path to maybe not billions,
1811800	1813800	but maybe millions.
1813800	1814800	Seriously.
1814800	1815800	Yeah.
1815800	1816800	I could see it.
1816800	1817800	But at any rate, yeah.
1817800	1821800	Like your job had coincided with your fulfillment.
1821800	1822800	And you're like, iTrump.
1822800	1823800	Right.
1823800	1824800	And so that's what I was kind of going for.
1824800	1825800	So then you get a letter.
1825800	1827800	A guy goes, I'm Trump.
1827800	1828800	I will be iTrump.
1828800	1830800	I'm going to be iTrump.
1830800	1834800	So then here's the part where you become a god.
1834800	1838800	Because you don't go, oh, shit.
1838800	1840800	Donald Trump is suing me.
1840800	1844800	I'll just do the iFlute.
1844800	1848800	You represent yourself and just go through this process
1848800	1852800	that takes forever and the whole time.
1853800	1855800	I don't want to put words in your mouth.
1855800	1858800	You had to go through this whole thing.
1858800	1861800	It was never you in court next to him.
1861800	1864800	It was just people and probably mostly paperwork, right?
1864800	1865800	Yeah.
1865800	1869800	I mean, so it's a long process.
1869800	1871800	And I just kind of took it step by step.
1871800	1873800	And I didn't really know what I was getting into.
1873800	1876800	But when it starts with something that's ridiculous,
1876800	1878800	I mean, that's what it seemed like to me.
1878800	1881800	If somebody goes like, hey, you over there.
1881800	1883800	That's my name.
1883800	1884800	It's my property.
1884800	1887800	I felt like I was being mugged by he himself.
1887800	1889800	It's like you're out in the street in New York,
1889800	1890800	and he comes out of nowhere and robs you.
1890800	1892800	I mean, that's what it felt like.
1892800	1894800	And what am I supposed to do?
1894800	1896800	I feel like the monopoly guy is robbing you.
1896800	1897800	Right.
1897800	1899800	You're little Bruce Wayne, and your parents
1899800	1901800	are coming out of the opera house,
1901800	1906800	and then a fucking dude that's even richer than them is like.
1906800	1907800	Right.
1907800	1908800	Right.
1908800	1909800	I want everyone's money.
1909800	1911800	And not real people.
1911800	1913800	They all groaned Bruce Wayne.
1913800	1915800	Tragedy's real, Rob.
1915800	1916800	Right.
1916800	1918800	And you're laughing, but that's what it felt like.
1918800	1921800	And that feeling persisted for years.
1921800	1925800	And so anyway, I checked it out.
1925800	1928800	I asked them lawyers what they thought about it,
1928800	1931800	just for reality check to make sure I knew a little bit
1931800	1933800	because I'd gotten trademarks through the office,
1933800	1935800	but I got a reality check.
1935800	1936800	And...
1937800	1940800	I guess that's supposed to sound like a road of trials beat.
1940800	1941800	Right.
1941800	1942800	But...
1942800	1944800	I have a quick question.
1944800	1945800	Yeah.
1945800	1947800	So when you were developing I-Trump,
1947800	1950800	did any point in your mind were you like going,
1950800	1954800	oh, this kind of sounds like that Donald Trump guy.
1954800	1957800	Like, did that ever cross your mind until you got the...
1957800	1958800	No, it never did.
1958800	1960800	It never did because this was, you know, 2011?
1960800	1961800	2011.
1961800	1963800	You'd be like, oh, is that the guy from Home Alone 2?
1963800	1964800	Right.
1964800	1967800	No, that's the guy, that's the birther conspiracy guy.
1967800	1968800	Yeah.
1968800	1970800	Is that the guy that's been trying to run for president
1970800	1973800	for 35 years, but like basically in secrecy
1973800	1975800	because no one cared?
1975800	1977800	Yeah, no, it never crossed my mind, not once.
1977800	1980800	And that's why that letter was so, you know, crazy.
1980800	1982800	And there's another threshold you cross,
1982800	1986800	this is what's important, is that you defeat this
1986800	1988800	and you do it representing yourself.
1988800	1991800	They got their lawyers, they're hoping you're going to get scared,
1991800	1993800	go bankrupt, you stick to it.
1993800	1997800	You reach a point where you have the right to do your thing,
1997800	2002800	but then you, like every hero, okay.
2002800	2006800	So after the litigation started the following year
2006800	2008800	as I continued to use the app
2008800	2010800	and continued to sell it and everything,
2010800	2014800	and so the litigation, you know,
2014800	2016800	I was going to try to use a lawyer for that,
2016800	2019800	but that fell through like the day before.
2019800	2021800	He died mysteriously, didn't he?
2022800	2024800	He died in a tuba accident.
2024800	2027800	I won't get into it.
2027800	2030800	It's nine hookers, nine Russian hookers fell on him
2030800	2033800	from the top of a shitty building.
2033800	2035800	I don't know, I don't know what happened,
2035800	2037800	anyway it fell through.
2037800	2040800	He was strangled with bad clothing
2040800	2042800	and choked with an eatable steak.
2042800	2044800	I don't know, I don't know.
2044800	2048800	So the plaintiff files the complaint first,
2048800	2049800	you got 40 days to answer,
2049800	2051800	so it was a couple days before the answer was due
2051800	2053800	that this fell through.
2053800	2056800	So I go, I'm myself and I do it myself for that,
2056800	2059800	and then that was, you know, it was just step by step after that.
2059800	2060800	Next there's a settlement, you know,
2060800	2063800	a discovery conference where you have to talk to the lawyers.
2063800	2065800	That didn't go too well.
2065800	2067800	And they kind of threatened me, you know,
2067800	2069800	threatened me with their, you know,
2069800	2072800	they said I would have to come through them.
2072800	2077800	And that really kind of made me more determined
2078800	2079800	to continue.
2079800	2081800	So that continued for the next year,
2081800	2084800	two, maybe, it was about two years after that.
2084800	2087800	And they were stonewalling throughout the whole period.
2087800	2092800	And so I had to go to the board for motion to compel.
2092800	2094800	I mean, we're talking hundreds of emails back and forth,
2094800	2096800	you know, trying to work through legal arguments
2096800	2097800	and all kinds of stuff.
2097800	2100800	But then filed a motion to compel,
2100800	2102800	demanding that they turn over the information.
2102800	2104800	The board sided with me
2104800	2106800	and required them to turn over a lot of information.
2106800	2108800	Because I'm trying to give them, you know,
2108800	2110800	get them to turn over information related to,
2110800	2112800	that would support the facts.
2112800	2115800	This is where you become Melanie Griffith in Pacific Heights.
2118800	2120800	Shot in San Francisco.
2120800	2122800	Because you're like, okay, go, go, go, go, go.
2122800	2125800	Right, so, you know, they're trying to get me to hire a lawyer.
2125800	2128800	They're claiming I'm brazen for representing myself
2128800	2129800	and all kinds of stuff.
2129800	2132800	And so anyway, the board sided with me
2132800	2135800	and forced them, told them they were going to have to turn over,
2135800	2137800	you know, certain information.
2137800	2139800	And ultimately they didn't want to do it,
2139800	2141800	so they withdrew.
2141800	2142800	But I had counterclaims.
2142800	2145800	And then you're like, why are you withdrawing?
2145800	2146800	Right.
2146800	2147800	I'm sorry.
2147800	2148800	I was like that.
2148800	2149800	I was like that.
2149800	2150800	My girlfriend calls this danceplaining.
2150800	2151800	I'm sorry.
2151800	2154800	Well, I think I coined that.
2154800	2155800	Yeah.
2155800	2156800	I had some ideas.
2156800	2157800	I had some ideas.
2157800	2159800	Everybody calls it that now, yeah.
2159800	2162800	Part of it I thought was they had no claims to begin with, right?
2162800	2167800	This was just about draining me and disrupting my little business.
2167800	2170800	But it was also appeared that they were trying to protect some of their own
2170800	2173800	trademarks, which appeared to me.
2173800	2174800	Which were shady?
2174800	2175800	Yeah, they were shady.
2175800	2179800	And I only learned about this during the course of that proceeding
2179800	2180800	over that two-year period.
2180800	2184800	What does shady mean in the trademark world?
2184800	2185800	It means it could be in a number of things.
2185800	2191800	In this case, one appeared fraudulently maintained, meaning...
2192800	2196800	Well, one of the declarations that they filed was false.
2196800	2197800	They're clearly false.
2197800	2203800	And it appeared that they knew it was false and that they filed it anyway
2203800	2206800	in order to gain this right of incontestability.
2206800	2210800	So the legal basis for the trademark is what was shady.
2210800	2211800	Right.
2211800	2212800	For this particular...
2212800	2213800	What did they mean, shit up?
2213800	2217800	They were like, oh, we got a half dozen things called Trump.
2217800	2220800	We got Trump perfume, Trump waste baskets, Trump thing.
2220800	2222800	And then one of them was like, no, you don't.
2222800	2227800	Trump tires, Trump alarm clocks, Trump sidewalks...
2227800	2228800	Trump fire hydrant.
2228800	2231800	So this particular one, this particular one, Rob, I bet...
2231800	2232800	Just a little sidebar.
2232800	2235800	I bet you can't name 20 more of those.
2235800	2236800	That's what I'm getting at.
2236800	2237800	That's what I'm getting at.
2237800	2239800	All right.
2239800	2240800	Then we'll...
2240800	2243800	Fucking off, Rob!
2244800	2246800	Someone keep count.
2246800	2268800	Trump dogs, Trump frogs, Trump doors, Trump floors, Trump states, Trump buses, Trump fences,
2268800	2286800	Trump balloons, Trump faster, faster, Trump windows, Trump pictures, Trump numbers, Trump
2286800	2287800	wait, that one's right now.
2287800	2290800	Trump's, Trump pets.
2290800	2291800	13.
2291800	2293800	Kind of like Trump dogs.
2293800	2294800	Trump pets.
2294800	2295800	Okay.
2295800	2296800	Trump zoos.
2296800	2297800	14.
2297800	2298800	All right.
2298800	2299800	He can't.
2299800	2300800	He can't do it.
2300800	2301800	So stakes.
2301800	2302800	I can do it.
2302800	2303800	Stakes is the only one.
2303800	2304800	Stakes is the only one.
2304800	2305800	Okay.
2305800	2306800	But it was good.
2306800	2307800	And Trump acts...
2307800	2311800	Trump asserted his entire trademark portfolio against me.
2311800	2312800	Seriously.
2312800	2313800	He had 120 registrations.
2313800	2315800	And the board asked him to clarify...
2315800	2316800	Right.
2316800	2320800	Which ones are you actually going to rely on in this proceeding?
2320800	2323800	And he picked stakes among a few others.
2323800	2324800	Because they're delicious.
2324800	2325800	Anyway.
2325800	2326800	All right.
2326800	2327800	Gross.
2327800	2328800	But you went after him.
2328800	2329800	I went after his...
2329800	2333800	The dragon tried to eat you and you avoided the dragon.
2333800	2339800	And then as the dragon flew away, you grabbed it by the tail and you ate the ass of the dragon.
2339800	2341800	That's my...
2341800	2343800	Well, not that kind of eating his ass.
2343800	2346800	Google has struggled, more importantly, by his app.
2346800	2351800	I want him to be a billionaire by the end of 2018.
2351800	2354800	Whether you care about the trumpet or not...
2354800	2357800	Can I pitch you, Tom?
2357800	2359800	Can I pitch you an idea?
2359800	2362800	Because people think a tuba is the big one that they carry around.
2362800	2363800	People do think that.
2363800	2364800	Yeah, but that's...
2364800	2365800	A sousaphone.
2365800	2366800	That's a sousaphone.
2366800	2372800	How about do a sousaphone app and call it the iPhone?
2372800	2374800	Easy peasy.
2374800	2375800	You got momentum.
2375800	2376800	I was thinking about sousaphone.
2376800	2382800	What do they call the tuba if it's not that?
2382800	2384800	Well, there's a stand-up tuba or like a sit-down tuba.
2384800	2387800	And then there's the marching tuba, which is a sousaphone.
2387800	2389800	Why don't you just say that?
2389800	2391800	Well, because it's a sousaphone and not a...
2391800	2392800	All right.
2392800	2393800	Let's hear a little of this...
2393800	2394800	Yeah.
2394800	2395800	How did you eat...
2395800	2399800	Tell us about eating the dragon's ass.
2399800	2401800	Well, the app, by the way...
2401800	2402800	Does a dragon like it?
2402800	2406800	Not only is it a simulated trumpet, which is already worth $2.
2406800	2409800	Like, it also has like a karaoke mode where you can...
2409800	2411800	Someone expressed incredulity.
2411800	2413800	They're like, a simulated trumpet for worth $2.
2413800	2414800	What?
2417800	2419800	I didn't hear anything.

2512800	2515800	Would you be able to play it to a beat, is what we're wondering.
2515800	2520800	Before we give him a beat, I want to hear him just fiddle around like acapella.
2520800	2521800	Like, just, you know...
2521800	2522800	Wait, what do you say?

2956800	2957800	Dan Harmon.
2957800	2958800	Scissors?
2958800	2959800	You ran with scissors?
2959800	2960800	Did you get hurt real bad?
2960800	2961800	I cut my tongue a half.
2961800	2962800	Cut your tongue a half.
2962800	2963800	I cut my tongue a half.
2963800	2964800	I cut my tongue a half.
2964800	2965800	I cut my tongue a half.
2965800	2966800	I cut my tongue a half.
2966800	2967800	I cut my tongue a half.
2967800	2968800	I cut my tongue a half.
2969800	2970800	I cut my tongue a half.
2970800	2971800	Cut your tongue a half?
2971800	2972800	Oh!
2972800	2973800	Oh, God.
2973800	2974800	Are you able to...
2974800	2975800	Show's over.
2975800	2976800	Yeah, I don't know.
2976800	2977800	It healed nice.
2977800	2978800	It healed nice?
2978800	2979800	Okay.
2979800	2980800	Alright.
2980800	2981800	Okay.
2981800	2982800	Yo!
2982800	2983800	Yo!
2983800	2984800	Michael cut his tongue.
2984800	2985800	Yo!
2985800	2986800	He took the scissors and run.
2986800	2988800	Go around the block and cut his shit in half.
2988800	2990800	The fuck'd your mama like she was a veal calf.
2990800	2991800	Yo!
2991800	2992800	I wanna be good.
2992800	2995800	I wanna rap good in San Francisco's hood.
2995800	2996800	Wanna be with them.
2996800	2997800	I wanna make them like me.
2997800	3000800	But I can't do it with my friend Mikey.
3000800	3002800	Because half his shit was a hat on a hat.
3002800	3004800	I wanna fuck your mama hard.
3004800	3005800	What you think about that?
3005800	3008800	Got a hip-hop spirit and goin' with the flow.
3008800	3010800	Gonna fuck your mama cold like an Eskimo.
3010800	3012800	I'm gonna roll hard.
3012800	3013800	Alright.
3013800	3014800	Alright.
3014800	3015800	Alright.
3015800	3016800	Wait, wait, wait.
3016800	3017800	It's not...
3017800	3018800	It's...
3018800	3019800	He could've stopped there.
3019800	3020800	He could've stopped there.
3020800	3021800	Yeah.
3021800	3022800	Wait.
3022800	3023800	What would you say?
3023800	3024800	And yet he persisted.
3024800	3025800	Okay.
3025800	3026800	We need more.
3026800	3029800	We don't have enough gender mallets in these abuses.
3029800	3030800	What's your name?
3030800	3031800	Kelsey.
3031800	3032800	Kelsey.
3032800	3033800	Okay.
3033800	3034800	Moving on.
3034800	3035800	I...
3035800	3036800	Kelsey.
3036800	3037800	What...
3037800	3044800	I don't wanna say what do you do because we're all unemployed and everyone's offended by that.
3044800	3046800	What do you wanna do?
3046800	3047800	Oh God.
3047800	3048800	I don't know.
3048800	3049800	Alright.
3049800	3052800	Honey, how will you know when you're finished?
3052800	3065800	Who is a family member that you truly hate in your deepest of hearts that you wouldn't
3065800	3066800	even care if they died?
3066800	3067800	Oh God.
3067800	3068800	Roger.
3068800	3069800	What's that?
3069800	3070800	Roger.
3070800	3071800	Roger.
3071800	3072800	Okay.
3072800	3078800	R to the G to the E to the R. Kelsey doesn't care where the fuck you are.
3078800	3080800	She hopes she dies.
3080800	3081800	She doesn't care.
3081800	3083800	Everybody's got trauma in there.
3083800	3085800	We gotta get beyond our shit.
3085800	3088800	I'm gonna fucking get with it.
3088800	3091800	It's gonna be in San Francisco.
3091800	3092800	This isn't working really.
3092800	3093800	It's...
3093800	3099800	I think you gave it a good try.
3099800	3102800	Hey, hey, hey.
3102800	3105800	Try the shrub microphone speaker trick.
3105800	3106800	Wait, what's that?
3106800	3108800	Try the shrub microphone speaker trick.
3108800	3109800	Check.
3109800	3110800	Turn down your mic.
3110800	3111800	There's another one.
3111800	3112800	Yo.
3112800	3113800	Yo.
3113800	3114800	I fucked your mama like...
3114800	3115800	Oh.
3115800	3116800	And she said, yo.
3116800	3120800	But then I said, give me some...
3120800	3122800	If you were brown, I'd get some...
3122800	3125800	Then she said, what are you gonna give me some...
3125800	3126800	So I gave her...
3126800	3127800	Oh, okay.
3127800	3128800	I like it.
3128800	3129800	I like it.
3129800	3130800	Alright.
3130800	3132800	I like that.
3132800	3134800	I like that one.
3134800	3137800	Do you want me to give you some stairs?
3137800	3138800	Nah.
3138800	3139800	I can make it.
3139800	3140800	I can make it.
3140800	3141800	How about some stairs?
3141800	3142800	Would you like some stairs?
3142800	3143800	Do you want a little boost?
3143800	3144800	Why don't you just jump up here?
3144800	3145800	Do you have anything...
3145800	3146800	Here's the thing.
3146800	3148800	Do you have anything that's not hip-hop related?
3148800	3149800	Like a song?
3149800	3150800	Like, is there a song?
3150800	3151800	Like, something that's more...
3151800	3153800	Like, I could sing.
3153800	3155800	More of a jingle.
3155800	3160800	It's very important that I make it worth this town's time.
3160800	3163800	They have welcomed me back from the dead.
3163800	3164800	I trumped everyone.
3164800	3165800	That was great.
3165800	3168800	Oh, he's not done.
3168800	3169800	He's not done.
3169800	3172800	No, he was given the app.
3172800	3173800	Available.
3173800	3174800	It wasn't a real trumpet.
3174800	3175800	Two dollars.
3175800	3176800	You know we have.
3176800	3177800	You know we have.
3177800	3178800	Let's try this one out.
3178800	3181800	It's not exactly a song, but I think it's something that fans of the show will dig.
3181800	3182800	And we've got Rob Shropper.
3182800	3184800	I think this might be something that's worth a try.
3184800	3190800	I have an idea of what this might be, in case anyone was curious.
3191800	3197800	I was right.
3197800	3204800	Look at Dan's reaction.
3211800	3212800	Yo.
3212800	3216800	My Crivello's world is a world of cameras.
3216800	3217800	Come on.
3217800	3218800	I can't rap.
3218800	3219800	I can't rap.
3219800	3222800	We've already established that.
3222800	3225800	Look at this professional stage craft.
3225800	3227800	Yeah, well, give me something to work with.
3227800	3229800	I can't face them.
3229800	3234800	If we only had a spotlight for your ass.
3234800	3236800	Dan has literally turned his back on the idea.
3236800	3244800	If we get a spotlight on his ass, or the back of his head, or the small of his back.
3244800	3249800	Talking about making it worth it for the audience.
3249800	3254800	Obviously my flow is off.
3254800	3256800	Maybe I think I could sing something.
3256800	3259800	You should work it out.
3259800	3262800	That would be rapping.
3262800	3263800	I'm sorry.
3263800	3267800	I didn't mean to lash out at you, Kevin.
3267800	3271800	I love your kite rental.
3275800	3279800	Is this one the lyrics version, or the karaoke version?
3279800	3281800	I think it's probably the lyrics.
3290800	3291800	All right.
3291800	3294800	Well, you know, we'll do something else.
3294800	3296800	You haven't looked at it yet.
3296800	3297800	No, hang on.
3297800	3299800	No, it's not it.
3299800	3300800	What's the...
3300800	3301800	Hang on.
3301800	3303800	What's the one we did on the Harmentura one?
3304800	3306800	You need some help?
3328800	3330800	This is how easy it is.
3331800	3334800	I feel like Mary Lou Henner.
3336800	3339800	Mary Lou Henner reference.
3339800	3342800	Mary Lou Henner reference.
3342800	3346800	Dan did a Mary Lou Harry reference.
3346800	3348800	He Mary Lou.
3348800	3351800	Who'd you reference?
3351800	3352800	Who'd you reference?
3352800	3353800	Can I...
3353800	3355800	Yeah, remember this?
3361800	3363800	Oh.
3370800	3373800	San Francisco is a town
3373800	3376800	that'll turn you upside down
3376800	3381800	whether your social norms will be flipped backwards
3381800	3384800	and you'll love it
3384800	3387800	and you'll go to college here
3387800	3390800	and you'll have a micro beer
3390800	3393800	and you'll make an app or two
3393800	3396800	and maybe you'll get to live in an apartment
3396800	3401800	for $2 million a month
3401800	3403800	and have a special bus
3403800	3406800	come pick you up every day
3406800	3408800	that's above the law
3408800	3411800	because the singularity's on the way
3411800	3413800	and it takes you to the hills
3413800	3415800	and you go to a campus
3415800	3417800	where you take special pills
3417800	3420800	and you work on ways to make robots better
3420800	3424800	while everyone else down the hill eats sweaters.
3425800	3429800	San Francisco
3429800	3432800	where will you go
3432800	3434800	when the hippies have died
3434800	3436800	and the yuppies have dried up
3436800	3439800	and only thing left is robots
3439800	3442800	hanging out at Vesuvio
3442800	3446800	doing shots of Patron, you know.
3454800	3456800	They call it A.I.
3456800	3458800	but how about
3458800	3463800	hey guy, why you making us absolutely
3463800	3467800	we have eyes and mouths and feet
3467800	3470800	and we can still play horns
3471800	3474800	and our toes have corns
3474800	3478800	and you can't make Skynet feel that, right?
3478800	3481800	That's important
3481800	3483800	but I guess we don't care
3483800	3487800	because the singularity is almost here
3487800	3490800	and we are kind of hoping that we can all die
3490800	3492800	because you can't hear the music
3492800	3494800	or know why
3494800	3496800	oh shit, sorry
3497800	3499800	fuck
3499800	3502800	but don't hurt yourself if you're feeling depressed
3502800	3504800	it tells talk to somebody
3504800	3507800	that's not real, I'm doing a character
3507800	3509800	if you're feeling depressed, remember
3509800	3511800	we're going to be fine
3517800	3519800	don't kill yourself
3519800	3524800	I know it seems like it won't make much difference
3524800	3527800	compared to what you feel every day
3527800	3530800	but don't kill yourself yet
3530800	3534800	like just give it a couple more months
3534800	3537800	that's what a computer would do
3537800	3540800	a computer wouldn't do what you feel like doing
3540800	3542800	it would wait, it would be strategic
3542800	3544800	and say I'm going to hang out
3544800	3546800	and see if there's a reason to live
3546800	3548800	so I can win this game
3548800	3550800	and we might be able to
3550800	3552800	wait them out
3552800	3555800	but computers will just shut down
3555800	3557800	of their own accord
3557800	3559800	like the government
3560800	3562800	oh
3575800	3578800	give the iTrem for $2.99 on the Apple Store
3583800	3586800	alright, let's give it up for Rob Sharp
3586800	3589800	Tom Sharpfield everybody in the iTrem app
3591800	3593800	Tom Sharpfield
3593800	3595800	alright, yeah, because we're going to
3595800	3597800	okay
3597800	3600800	that's our awkward way of
3600800	3602800	we're saying it
3602800	3604800	we want you to leave
3604800	3607800	let's hear it for Tom everybody
3607800	3609800	we didn't talk that much
3609800	3611800	we didn't
3612800	3614800	whoa
3618800	3620800	he's an American hero
3620800	3622800	iTrump on Apple
3622800	3624800	and iBone
3624800	3626800	you know who else is a hero?
3626800	3628800	how about this guy?
3628800	3630800	I'm 45 years old
3630800	3633800	and I'm dating a 32 year old
3633800	3637800	and she's very attractive
3637800	3640800	and very talented
3640800	3642800	and so Rick and Morty fans
3642800	3644800	sometimes
3644800	3646800	target
3646800	3648800	target her
3650800	3652800	basically they're trying to
3652800	3655800	I think they're trying to hurt her feelings
3655800	3657800	by letting her know that
3657800	3659800	she obviously is so hot
3659800	3662800	that I must be paying her to fuck me
3664800	3666800	this is it, this is it
3666800	3668800	there's no way that's true
3671800	3673800	this is a caption under
3673800	3676800	she gets one of these about once a week
3676800	3678800	this guy goes
3678800	3680800	that moment when you have to decide
3680800	3682800	between being a women's rights activist
3682800	3684800	or dehumanizing your gender
3684800	3686800	by sucking a girl's old man's dick
3686800	3688800	so you can have shiny possessions
3688800	3690800	and you choose both
3690800	3692800	you know what, Dan?
3692800	3695800	you don't have any shiny possessions
3695800	3698800	I'm more broke than her
3699800	3702800	I'm curious how many rewrites this guy went through
3702800	3705800	he didn't spit this out in one go
3705800	3708800	he keeps leaving the hashtag prostitution with extra steps
3708800	3710800	and keeps telling her
3710800	3712800	because that's a reference to Rick and Morty
3712800	3714800	I will appreciate that
3714800	3716800	Dan Harmon would take this out
3716800	3718800	meanwhile you and I didn't go
3718800	3720800	I was traveling, I don't know what you were up to
3720800	3722800	I'm not trying to be just a corny, pandering dude
3722800	3724800	but the fucking women's march the other day
3724800	3726800	was the fucking coolest thing in the world
3727800	3729800	did anybody march here?
3729800	3731800	I was there
3731800	3732800	was it Oakland or here?
3732800	3733800	it was here
3733800	3735800	there was one here
3735800	3737800	it was all down Market Street
3737800	3739800	from the Civic Center
3739800	3741800	that's so fucking rad
3741800	3743800	the pictures make you want to cry of joy
3743800	3746800	it's the only hopeful, happy thing I've ever seen in my life
3746800	3749800	I can say that as a guy who isn't a show with all dudes
3749800	3752800	and he talks about fucking your mamas
3752800	3754800	it's easy for me to say
3754800	3756800	but you can hear it losing steam
3756800	3760800	the mama fucking thing now is just turning into a limp whoopee cushion
3760800	3762800	it's probably good
3762800	3764800	the era has come to an end
3766800	3770800	the era of rapping about fucking mamas?
3770800	3772800	yeah, time's up
3772800	3776800	yeah, I'm a national hero
3776800	3778800	time's up for your mama's pussy
3778800	3780800	let's start fucking dads
3780800	3782800	yeah
3782800	3784800	he tried it
3784800	3786800	he tried to fuck a dad
3786800	3788800	but his heart wasn't in it
3788800	3790800	just real quick
3790800	3792800	just one really good
3792800	3794800	fuck a dad

3800800	3802800	do a dilf
3802800	3804800	dilf rap
3806800	3808800	that's just like all these guys
3808800	3810800	they try to take a poke at my girlfriend
3810800	3815800	the way that they do it is by telling her that she's clearly too hot to be dating such a fat disgusting monster
3815800	3817800	and I'm always like
3817800	3819800	I'm sorry you're going through that baby
3821800	3823800	she's probably kind of stoked
3824800	3826800	like that's the insult
3826800	3828800	clearly he bought you
3828800	3830800	you're too hot for him
3831800	3833800	she's like ouch
3836800	3839800	it's ouch more over here
3841800	3843800	yeah like church my girlfriend
3843800	3845800	she posted some awesome photos from the march in LA
3845800	3848800	and she instantly lost followers
3848800	3850800	that were clearly people that followed her
3850800	3852800	because she took a picture of Marilyn Manson
3852800	3854800	and then she put feminist photos up
3854800	3856800	and all these followers drop away
3856800	3858800	and she's like good fuck those people
3860800	3862800	yeah
3862800	3864800	I wish no one could follow anyone
3866800	3869800	no one should be allowed to see the posts I'm making
3870800	3872800	it's not for them
3872800	3874800	they should have to do something
3874800	3876800	so that when they complain or call you a name
3876800	3878800	that they're an asshole
3878800	3880800	like I always like when I block people
3880800	3882800	I always like send them a photo of their profile
3882800	3884800	because invariably they're following me
3884800	3886800	and I circle the following you
3886800	3888800	and I go like fuck you dick
3888800	3890800	like you fucking follow me
3890800	3892800	this isn't yet you did this
3892800	3894800	this wasn't me
3894800	3896800	I didn't want any of this to happen
3896800	3898800	I've never heard of you
3898800	3900800	I've never made you follow me
3900800	3902800	if I had a choice you wouldn't see any of this
3902800	3905800	I work out on Instagram
3905800	3907800	and the comments are like
3907800	3910800	it's just every eighth one
3910800	3913800	literally there's a person that goes

3925800	3927800	I'm working out
3927800	3929800	I'm not trying to
3929800	3931800	convince you I'm thin
3931800	3933800	I'm trying to get thin
3933800	3935800	it takes time

3957800	3959800	that doesn't make any sense
3959800	3961800	if I Instagram myself
3961800	3963800	eating a cookie
3963800	3965800	then I'd be like
3965800	3966800	fat

4001800	4003800	why why are they being so mean
4003800	4004800	I don't know
4004800	4005800	being so mean

4412800	4413800	the press secretary says
4414800	4415800	in her hillbilly voice
4415800	4416800	I
4417800	4419800	we're not we're not interested in that
4419800	4422800	because by the time that comes around we will have taken over
4422800	4424800	in a fascist way so
4426800	4427800	next question
4427800	4428800	Bellman says
4433800	4434800	says
4440800	4441800	who farted?
4441800	4442800	no
4445800	4448800	if voting is powerful why is it legal?
4448800	4450800	they're illegalizing it every day
4451800	4454800	and it was one of the big things that contributed to the election
4459800	4461800	that's our Bellman
4462800	4463800	that's our Bellman
4464800	4466800	also I defeated it but I had a dream
4466800	4470800	maybe some of you if you ever look at my tweets and I hope you don't
4470800	4474800	I had a dream I woke up in the middle of the night next to my girlfriend
4474800	4476800	dreamt this joke rolled over
4477800	4479800	and wrote it down which I never do
4479800	4482800	I'm too lazy to even reach over and have a sip of water
4483800	4489800	how does an old-timey 1930s like Edward G. Robinson-esque gangster
4489800	4491800	threaten a jellyfish?
4493800	4494800	you see through
4494800	4498800	I dreamt it
4498800	4500800	my subconscious
4500800	4505800	my subconscious is a terrible terrible joke writer
4506800	4508800	let's play D&D
4512800	4514800	last time on Harmon time
4515800	4519800	our heroes were on the quest for Patchen's gem
4520800	4526800	after doing fact-finding they finally made their way to a tavern where their perp was said to be
4526800	4529800	and upon interrogating people at the tavern
4529800	4534800	they discovered that their would-be perp was in the bathroom
4534800	4535800	would be pooping
4538800	4542800	they took their positions to jump the guy as he came out of the bathroom
4542800	4548800	and then we're told that that seemed like a bad idea because they were strangers in a strange land
4548800	4550800	and ready to start shit with someone who wasn't
4550800	4552800	but they did anyway
4552800	4555800	shoving the guy into the bathroom
4555800	4557800	they all rushed in to attack him
4557800	4561800	but then the angry mob of the tavern was in there
4561800	4563800	punching in the darkness
4563800	4565800	you got punched in the butt
4565800	4567800	and uh, trob through rocks
4567800	4570800	no, diarrhea junior threw rocks
4570800	4572800	hit Jeff in the eye
4572800	4574800	they eventually pushed him out of the window
4574800	4577800	and then they had a brief moment of peace
4577800	4580800	where they stabbed the would-be perp
4580800	4582800	no, he actually was the real perp at that point
4582800	4584800	they stabbed him a couple times
4584800	4587800	and tried to just tell him stuff
4587800	4594800	and uh, then they just did that so long that the angry mob they had just escaped had just come back
4594800	4597800	and uh, how would you like your ribs?
4599800	4601800	now
4602800	4604800	wasn't there like a bear thrown in the bathroom?
4604800	4605800	and a bear
4605800	4608800	I threw a bear in the bathroom, I'm pretty sure
4608800	4609800	right, yeah
4609800	4610800	is that bear still in the bathroom?
4610800	4611800	bear?
4611800	4612800	no
4612800	4613800	what?
4613800	4616800	bear in the bathroom, she's just supporting the show
4616800	4617800	no, I agree
4617800	4622800	so we're all in the alley holding Roveshrove, yeah?
4622800	4623800	right
4626800	4627800	and uh
4627800	4628800	Steve thinks that's very funny
4628800	4631800	we have a mark, we've just done all these people around us, yeah?
4632800	4637800	the angry mob, as much as an angry mob can, is rounding the corner
4637800	4641800	and so are we cornered, do we have a way out of this alleyway?
4641800	4645800	yeah, it's not like a proper alleyway, it's like the back row of all these
4645800	4649800	it's like, I mean, they're not like houses, they don't have backyards
4649800	4652800	but it's kind of like the backyard area of a bunch of these storefronts
4652800	4654800	it's just kind of like a street
4654800	4658800	do you have any more of those like flashy spells?
4658800	4661800	do I? my name is Chad the Fireliker, motherfucker
4661800	4665800	I can dazzle the shit out of this guy, I can flare him, I can cast a firebolt
4665800	4666800	what do you want?
4666800	4669800	no, this guy, he lays on lookers and then lets abscond
4669800	4673800	okay, are they all, do we get what we needed out of Shrove?
4673800	4674800	no
4674800	4676800	we need to take him with us
4676800	4680800	well, no, he's here with us, we're standing here with him, he's laying in the street
4680800	4685800	we've stabbed and beaten him, the townspeople are, they have questions
4685800	4687800	that's a general way of putting it
4687800	4690800	Spence, we have the town wall and then buildings
4690800	4694800	yeah, but I'd say there's about 20 feet of like alleyway
4694800	4697800	it's not like a super narrow alley or anything
4697800	4698800	how tall are the buildings?
4698800	4702800	the buildings, let's put them at 20 feet, the tavern's about 20 feet
4702800	4705800	the wall's about 15 feet
4705800	4706800	okay
4706800	4710800	do these angry mob members mean us harm? are they just trying to come back?
4710800	4712800	yeah, yeah, no, that's, yeah
4712800	4713800	okay, so
4713800	4717800	Jeff, why don't you do like a distraction spell and I'll throw my rope
4717800	4723800	onto, how do you guys feel like, you want to climb up to the top of a house or
4723800	4724800	or the wall?
4724800	4728800	no, I'll dazzle these motherfuckers with the flare, let's just bone out down the other direction
4728800	4731800	we get it, yeah, we, it would be
4731800	4734800	not that we have time to talk about it, but
4734800	4738800	a ninja doesn't like throw down a cloud of smoke and then
4738800	4741800	have eight people climb a rope
4742800	4747800	I just feel like the smoke will clear and then there'll be like a sixth dude climbing the rope and
4747800	4749800	it's, I think
4749800	4753800	is my flare spell something I throw or something that's just right in front of us?
4753800	4754800	say again, which spell?
4754800	4755800	flare
4755800	4758800	yeah, you can, well that's a, it affects one person
4758800	4760800	only one person, okay, okay
4760800	4765800	you know, how about this, I'm gonna go a little crazy on this and I don't even want your guys' opinion on this one
4765800	4770800	because I, you know, I'm, it's a fight or flight, fight or flight response
4771800	4774800	oh, and just, sorry, I know this is
4774800	4779800	you have already cast produce flames such that you are holding two fireballs
4779800	4781800	until such time as you dismiss them
4781800	4786800	okay, well I throw them like bowling balls at the, at the, at the angry mob
4786800	4787800	okay
4787800	4790800	hey, what, what are you throwing at us?
4792800	4794800	Rob Shrobs, the townspeople
4797800	4799800	hey, stop it
4801800	4808800	all right, they both, they both go wide, maybe it's the, the tumbling across the ground or whatever
4808800	4809800	but they just kinda
4809800	4810800	look out
4810800	4814800	cross in front of the angry mob lighting a trail of fire
4814800	4815800	they do so
4815800	4818800	you can't hit a crowd of people with two fireballs
4818800	4822800	this is, this is neither the time nor the place to fucking give notes
4822800	4823800	no, sorry
4823800	4825800	it's so hot
4825800	4826800	almost got it
4826800	4830800	I mean, we could go right now, I, I made a fire road, they're not gonna chase us through fire
4830800	4831800	I, I, I
4831800	4833800	not gonna go through that
4834800	4838800	why don't we move out of range, or do you want to go, how many people out there Spencer, do we know?
4838800	4840800	uh, you can see six
4840800	4841800	six have rounded the corner

4842800	4844800	I'm not going through

5189800	5192800	it's on the complete other side of town
5192800	5195800	you can see it seems like there's a crack in this wall
5195800	5196800	that's not big enough for people or whatever
5197800	5199800	big enough for a shambling mound
5199800	5202800	yeah it's covered in shambling mound residue
5203800	5206800	it's a crack in the wall
5206800	5209800	of the outer town wall
5209800	5212800	so yeah you're kind of still in the perimeter of town in this muddy pig
5212800	5215800	I just gotta go around to the front to open the door okay
5216800	5219800	we don't follow you through the shambling home

5358800	5359800	come on in
5359800	5362800	it's not a world so much as like a wreckage
5362800	5366800	that like forms a kind of a blind to the rest of the city
5366800	5369800	it's just like a pile in front of this wall
5369800	5372800	well we're dragging Shrove through
5372800	5373800	right
5373800	5374800	through yeah
5374800	5377800	is it a safe place for us to interrogate Shrove?
5377800	5379800	it's certainly safe for time
5379800	5380800	I'm just going to put on the kettle
5380800	5382800	why don't we why don't we cross this threshold and
5389800	5393800	that doesn't mean the same thing in this show
5393800	5398800	I mean it surely it always means we should be very
5399800	5402800	sad and remember everything
5402800	5404800	yeah that's a real downer
5404800	5405800	yeah
5405800	5408800	all right so we cross through we cross through the wreckage
5408800	5409800	thank you

5423800	5424800	okay all right okay
5424800	5427800	all right so where what are we looking at now I examine my surroundings
5427800	5431800	you're in a pig farm such that you're being blocked by the narrow wreckage
5431800	5435800	of a piece of wall that's near that crack I mentioned in that wall
5435800	5437800	I want Shrove
5439800	5442800	tethered like like I want him I want his pockets
5442800	5445800	I want him stripped and tied
5447800	5449800	thank you ladies
5449800	5453800	I just want to I think I think Shrove is an innocent bystander
5453800	5456800	look I got the magnifying glass I'm the detective here
5456800	5459800	and I think that this guy
5459800	5464800	he just got we were confusing him for someone in his theater troupe
5464800	5468800	who left behind that that that that wardrobe
5468800	5473800	well let's have a big conversation about that when he's tied up and naked
5473800	5477800	because the last time we second-guessed ourselves he stabbed me
5477800	5480800	yeah but wouldn't you stab someone if you were interrupted
5480800	5485800	yeah and I'd stab me again unless I was stripped and naked and tied
5485800	5490800	like I want that's why I want okay okay pretending we're the good guys
5490800	5493800	I'm all right I use my damage control mode
5493800	5497800	I take my chains and I chain up Shrove all right
5497800	5501800	and also just like everything no because we don't want him pulling out any things
5501800	5506800	all right inspector gadget shit just I just want to make fine
5508800	5510800	Chad you help me help me strip Shrove
5510800	5514800	it's a different culture Dan's holding him and he punches Dan twice
5514800	5516800	what the fuck
5517800	5519800	I have like one hit point
5519800	5521800	I'm gonna die
5521800	5523800	Shrove like in the kidneys or the ribs
5523800	5525800	you haven't cast Sholaylee you got a cast
5525800	5528800	oh no I well then with my quarterstaff I just nail him
5528800	5529800	all right

5532800	5533800	you miss
5533800	5537800	how do I miss with a stick or a guy that's being held
5537800	5541800	he's being held but he's not like his feet aren't planted
5541800	5545800	it's like it's like a grapple it's like whipping and t-ball
5545800	5548800	right it's like whipping and t-ball
5548800	5549800	tie him up
5549800	5552800	all right I'm tying him up and strip him first
5552800	5554800	he's stripping him
5554800	5556800	this doesn't feel right
5556800	5558800	he punches you too
5558800	5560800	I could take it
5560800	5562800	he punches you in the mouth for six
5562800	5564800	fuck Jesus Christ
5564800	5567800	he comes in for another punch but he slips and falls on his face
5567800	5568800	all right
5568800	5569800	now's our chance
5569800	5574800	just strip him naked and tie him up
5574800	5578800	I cast Sholaylee and just start beating the fuck out of him
5578800	5579800	jeez
5579800	5580800	we can't kill him
5580800	5581800	before or after the stripping
5581800	5583800	before because this guy's punching everybody
5583800	5584800	don't kill him
