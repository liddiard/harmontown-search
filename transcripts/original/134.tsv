0	11000	From Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California, Harman Town is now in session.
11000	21000	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
21000	24000	Thank you.
24000	26000	Alright.
27000	29000	Thank you very much.
29000	30000	Very enthusiastic.
30000	31000	Very good people.
31000	33000	Thank you for not going to the Grammys.
33000	34000	Thank you so much.
34000	40000	I know a lot of you are nominated and you just decided to check the results later.
40000	45000	Yeah, I got my, I Harman back here and made me a quickie for Shadowrun tonight
45000	49000	because I didn't want to, we haven't figured out, I don't want to talk about that.
50000	61000	We haven't figured out how to use, make these devices in our pockets usable on the level of a notepad yet.
61000	62000	It still hasn't happened.
62000	64000	I'm 42 fucking years old.
64000	65000	That's all I'm going to say about it.
65000	69000	It's still easier to have a piece of paper around your neck.
69000	71000	It shouldn't be.
71000	81000	At the peak of the palm trio, I remember I was typing really fast with my thumbs
81000	86000	and then this iPhone thing happened and it's wonderful, it's a great looking thing
86000	88000	and you can touch the screen and move it around.
88000	94000	But if you added up all of the time that we spend going back and correcting all the words,
94000	97000	boy, Jeff, second life.
98000	99000	Okay, all right.
99000	102000	So, did any extra black people come tonight?
106000	107000	What's your name, sir?
107000	108000	Brian.
108000	109000	Brian?
109000	110000	Anybody else?
114000	116000	You better not be white.
117000	119000	You better be genuinely black.
119000	121000	That's only funny if you're black.
122000	123000	No, it's funny both ways.
123000	124000	No, it's not.
124000	126000	It's not funny if he's white.
126000	128000	It's hilarious if he's white.
128000	129000	No, it's not.
129000	132000	Imagine if Jim Belushi's doing that in the back, that's not funny.
132000	135000	He's doing a black guy impression.
135000	138000	It's funny if it's Tiny Lister Jr.
141000	143000	There's no middle ground between those?
143000	145000	No, there's lots of middle ground.
145000	147000	It's also funny if it's just any black guy.
147000	149000	What is your name back there?
149000	150000	Max.
150000	151000	Max?
151000	152000	Yes, sir.
152000	153000	All right.
153000	154000	Yes, sir.
154000	156000	Were you in the military at some point?
156000	157000	Yes, sir, or no?
162000	165000	See, now, it's way funnier if that guy's white.
166000	170000	It's starting to get okay if he's white.
170000	172000	Because it's a dimensionalized character,
172000	175000	and it's not just an impression of a race.
175000	177000	It's becoming a character.
177000	179000	So, it's becoming fine.
179000	181000	He's becoming Tracy Ullman if he's white.
185000	191000	Max, what do you do for a living?
191000	193000	Perform.
193000	195000	What sort of performances do you do, Max?
195000	198000	What sort of performances do you want me to do?
200000	202000	I'll do that the wrong way, though.
202000	205000	I'll take it however I want to take it, Max.
205000	209000	Well, are you willing to come up on stage and feel it out with us?
209000	210000	Yes, sir.
210000	211000	Okay.
211000	213000	Welcome, Max, to the stage, everybody.
215000	219000	This show really got off right out of the gate like a rocket.
220000	221000	All right.
221000	222000	Cross your fingers.
224000	226000	This guy better be black as hell.
231000	232000	Yeah!
233000	235000	Black enough, Max.
237000	238000	Awesome.
238000	239000	Hello, sir.
240000	241000	All right.
241000	243000	Now, you can grab one of those and have a seat.
243000	244000	Microphone and a seat.
244000	245000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
245000	246000	Microphone and a seat.
246000	250000	Just as promised, your people in the 1940s.
255000	260000	So, did you come because last week I pled for more black people?
261000	262000	No.
262000	263000	Okay.
264000	267000	Do you have the blackest voice ever?
268000	270000	It was me and James Earl Jones.
271000	274000	Every year, we just kind of see who can go more bass.
275000	276000	And I'm getting there.
276000	279000	When I was 13, it was close, but now he's starting to lose it.
280000	281000	Can you sing bass?
281000	283000	Can you sing a low note?
283000	284000	I wish I could.
284000	286000	I love bass singers, like a harmony band.
287000	288000	This is me.
289000	290000	Get low.
290000	291000	Get lower than that.
291000	292000	Okay, okay.
292000	293000	Hold on.
298000	299000	Oh.
300000	301000	That's good.
301000	305000	There's such a fine line between post-racial and pre-minstral humor.
309000	311000	How would you like me to perform?
311000	312000	Let's bring them up.
312000	313000	How low is your voice?
313000	315000	Oh, sweet chariot.
317000	318000	It's a hair's breadth.
318000	319000	What are we doing?
319000	321000	I guess the clock goes all the way around.
321000	324000	We're talking about a gentleman with a great basso profundo voice.
325000	326000	I'm not indicting us.
326000	330000	I'm just pointing out, like, boy, what a razor's edge we walk in the modern world,
330000	336000	and how far you go to just find yourself back at fascination with each other.
336000	337000	I feel bad for Brian.
337000	338000	Is it Brian, right?
339000	343000	The first guy, he just got supplanted by Max Hill.
343000	346000	Well, because there was just good comedy.
346000	351000	There was just a voice from the back, like, yeah, I'm here.
352000	353000	It was just good.
353000	359000	I mean, Brian can come up, too, but I don't want to feel like we're pitting people against each other.
361000	362000	Brian.
363000	365000	I can feel you present, though.
369000	373000	Brian, do you also want to come up, or do you not want to be dehumanized like this?
377000	379000	Brian, get your ass up here, Brian.
380000	381000	Okay, all right.
384000	385000	All right.
387000	389000	Man, I'm so excited.
390000	395000	Just for that random, like, I wish that there was still television
395000	400000	so someone could be flipping through channels and see me hanging out.
402000	406000	All my white guilt is just, like, being sucked off the range
406000	410000	through a super vacuum out into the stratosphere.
410000	411000	I love it.
411000	415000	All the heat from being a 42-year-old fat white oppressor.
415000	419000	I just feel like, now I just feel like I'm fucking on honest ground.
419000	420000	What should we talk about?
420000	421000	Randy Quaid?
424000	425000	Is he in the news?
425000	428000	Yeah, I think he's doing something.
429000	432000	Brian, sorry, enough about me.
433000	435000	What do you do for a living?
436000	438000	I work at a Jamba Juice.
440000	442000	Sounds like you're making it up a little bit.
442000	443000	That's terrible.
443000	444000	Oh, yeah.
444000	446000	But not, I mean, and they're not watching or anything.
447000	451000	Oh, no, nobody at that Jamba Juice would ever watch a podcast
451000	453000	or listen to it or anything.
453000	456000	What's the worst thing about working at a Jamba Juice?
456000	458000	Oh, the people.
459000	461000	The coworkers or the customers?
461000	462000	Oh, the customers for sure.
463000	465000	Juice isn't that important.
465000	466000	It's not.
466000	468000	There's a lot of things going on in the world.
468000	470000	Juice is not the important thing.
470000	473000	Yeah, by the time you've already decided that you don't even,
473000	475000	you don't even need solid food.
475000	477000	You should be an easygoing person when you come to.
477000	480000	Yeah, the worst thing that happened to you is that your juice is five minutes late.
480000	482000	You have a fucking great life.
482000	483000	Fantastic.
483000	486000	So you're saying they're a little impatient and bossy.
486000	488000	Yeah, just generally assholes.
488000	489000	How old are you?
489000	490000	Can I ask you're young enough?
490000	491000	I'm 23.
491000	492000	Okay, yeah.
492000	494000	Young enough to be able to ask.
494000	495000	23.
498000	501000	Ah, pre-9-11.
501000	504000	You haven't even been through 9-11 yet.
504000	507000	Isn't, is that how age works?
507000	511000	Oh, oh, we all experienced time at the, okay, all right.
511000	517000	Sorry, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought all of us had to turn 32 for 9-11 to happen.
519000	521000	Max, you said you're a performer.
521000	523000	What do you do?
523000	524000	I'm an actor.
524000	525000	You're an actor?
525000	526000	Yes, sir.
526000	527000	Are you working on stuff?
527000	531000	I just relocated to Los Angeles three days ago, four days ago.
531000	532000	Welcome.
532000	533000	From where?
533000	535000	From New York.
535000	537000	From New York, wow.
537000	541000	Man, this is an authentic black person.
541000	548000	This isn't, this isn't like the, you know, one of your black friends.
548000	550000	Who doesn't know any other black people.
550000	553000	I bet you know a ton of black people, don't you?
553000	557000	I went to school with a bunch of them, acting, black, black acting school.
557000	558000	No.
558000	559000	No, okay.
559000	560000	No.
560000	561000	All right, I pushed it too far.
561000	562000	I pushed it too far.
562000	565000	I thought it was like, you're, there was a show when I was a kid called Fame.
565000	567000	It was about acting.
567000	571000	Yeah, I remember Fame is about LaGuardia, which is, LaGuardia in New York City is cool.
571000	574000	Yeah, yeah, it was, that's not where you went, right?
574000	577000	No, but I know, I know some black actors that went to LaGuardia.
577000	578000	Yeah.
578000	580000	I think it was, was it Irene Caro?
580000	581000	Is that the actress?
582000	583000	She sang the song.
583000	584000	Oh, okay.
584000	589000	In the title sequence, there was an actor who was one of the teachers who, I think first
589000	591000	there was a movie with the song.
591000	597000	I don't know if the movie was an adaptation of the song, but then the TV show, and then
597000	601000	the credits for the TV show and the opening title sequence, there was just this woman
601000	603000	saying, you want fame?
603000	604000	You want success?
604000	609000	Well, right here is where you start paying in sweat.
609000	612000	And it was just a show about talented high school kids.
612000	614000	In the movie, that's where Coco takes her shirt off and cries.
614000	615000	Oh, yeah, yeah.
615000	616000	You want fame?
616000	617000	Fame costs.
617000	618000	Right now is where you start paying.
618000	619000	Oh, you know what I'm talking about.
619000	624000	When I was a kid, I was at MGM, which is now Sony lot, and I was on a, I think I was shooting
624000	628000	something, like I would have heaven or something, and I was, we're walking up, me and my mom
628000	633000	are walking down the, between the sound stages, and a golf cart goes by, and on the back of
633000	637000	the golf cart, we're walking, and on the back of the golf cart going past us, on the back
637000	641000	of it is, I forget the actor's name, but he played Leroy on Fame, who was a fucking
641000	642000	great dancer.
642000	643000	Remember him?
643000	644000	Oh, yeah.
644000	645000	Did you have cornrows?
645000	646000	Kind of, yeah, I think.
646000	647000	And he waved at me, like he knew me.
647000	652000	Oh, he pointed at me and waved, and my mom's like, why is Leroy waving at you?
652000	655000	I go, I think, I think Leroy thinks he knows me.
655000	657000	I felt so cool.
657000	658000	Max, you want a drink?
658000	661000	You were looking, I was, I was eyeing it, but you can, you got to help yourself, though.
661000	664000	I don't want to dig in the ice with my hands for you.
664000	666000	No, I, I, thank you.
667000	669000	So, Brian, are you from L.A.?
669000	672000	No, I'm from New Orleans, originally, but I live in Oakland.
672000	673000	Live in Oakland?
673000	678000	Yeah, I just came down to help, here to help a friend move, and to see Harmon town.
678000	679000	Really?
679000	680000	Yeah.
680000	682000	You came, you helped somebody move, and you came to a different town to do it?
682000	683000	Yes.
683000	684000	You're a good person.
684000	685000	Yeah, good friend.
685000	686000	Yeah.
686000	688000	I really like convenience, also.
688000	690000	Brian, did you want a drink?
690000	691000	Yeah.
691000	692000	Okay.
692000	694000	All right, Harmon's become a bartender, I love this.
694000	696000	We really do need, like a...
696000	697000	Dan Harmon is making me a drink.
697000	698000	This is amazing.
698000	704000	Yeah, it's like, uh, it's like, uh, Billy the Kid cleaning your gun.
704000	705000	Damn.
707000	709000	That's exactly what I was thinking.
709000	712000	It's like Patrick Swayze packing your parachute.
712000	714000	Or teaching me how to dance.
714000	716000	It's like Santa Claus sitting on your lap.
717000	719000	There you go, there you go.
720000	725000	I group around the bullseye, and then the professional improviser.
725000	728000	By the way, we have Greg Proops here tonight.
728000	729000	He'll be coming up.
729000	730000	Yeah!
733000	736000	Inarguably a white man, but...
736000	739000	Although, when you get Greg drunk, when Greg gets just drunk and high enough,
739000	742000	he becomes a black jazz musician from 1933.
742000	745000	He's a very groovy, groovy white man.
745000	747000	Yeah, he becomes incredibly like a jazz musician.
747000	748000	It's very good.
748000	750000	So we got Max, the aspiring performer.
750000	751000	So you're very young, too.
751000	753000	What are you, 20...
753000	754000	Can I ask?
754000	755000	Yeah, 27.
755000	756000	Oh, okay.
756000	761000	So, uh, out here from New York, it sounds like he's doing a bit sometimes.
763000	765000	You just came here from New York.
765000	769000	So now, like, what is the plight of a young actor in LA in 2015?
769000	770000	How does it work?
770000	771000	Does it still look the same?
771000	773000	You still got a pile of headshots in your back seat?
773000	774000	And you just kind of...
774000	775000	It's all digital now.
775000	776000	I don't know about...
776000	777000	Yeah.
777000	778000	I mean...
781000	782000	Yeah.
782000	783000	Yeah, now it's just...
783000	785000	Well, I mean, so, is there...
785000	786000	Do you have an agent?
786000	787000	I have a manager.
787000	788000	Yeah.
788000	789000	Yeah.
789000	791000	Is there, like, does your manager say stuff like,
791000	794000	you know, you got to do that YouTube now?
798000	799000	He's a New Yorker, so...
799000	801000	He does kind of talk like that.
801000	804000	He has, like, an old, old New York Jewish accent.
804000	805000	Sorry.
805000	806000	You're about to...
806000	807000	I just...
807000	808000	I touched my iPad.
808000	809000	That's not a bit.
809000	810000	I just touched my thing.
810000	811000	We were about to kick a freestyle.
811000	813000	You're going to drop the beat, and we were gonna...
813000	816000	That was unintentional, but if you'd like to, that can happen.
816000	820000	I'm not allowed to solicit that from you, but you are...
820000	826000	You don't have to say a word if you would like to do some freestyle rapping.
826000	828000	That is fine by me.
828000	829000	Yeah.
829000	832000	You want to battle?
833000	835000	Oh...
837000	840000	Isn't that...
840000	842000	I mean, that's what they call it.
842000	843000	It's...
843000	844000	Yeah.
845000	848000	See, now, Max seems pretty down with that.
848000	850000	Ryan, are you up for that?
850000	851000	Um...
851000	854000	I'm more of a manager type.
855000	856000	Right.
856000	860000	It's like, I am literally up here because of the color of my skin.
860000	862000	He said he wanted to rap, and they're gonna rap.
862000	865000	Ryan, I need you to go around and just collect money from people.
865000	867000	Somebody give me a hat, please.
867000	868000	We need to collect.
868000	872000	We need $5 a head, and...
872000	875000	I think there should be some stakes for the winner of this battle.
875000	877000	I think there should be, like...
877000	878000	All right.
878000	881000	Well, I mean, I make a cash.
881000	882000	All right.
883000	885000	You're throwing out money, then.
885000	886000	All right.
886000	887000	I'll join.
889000	890000	All right.
890000	891000	I got 20 here.
891000	892000	Is that good?
892000	893000	I have a 22, so...
893000	894000	Okay.
894000	895000	So, $20...
895000	896000	Bring your 20 over here, Harmon.
896000	897000	Okay.
897000	898000	Give it to me.
898000	899000	All right.
899000	900000	Pass it down.
900000	902000	Brian, can you hand that to me?
902000	903000	All right.
903000	904000	So, the kitty...
904000	906000	The kitty is $40.
906000	911000	We're gonna do it democratically by applause by the end of this thing, but we're gonna
911000	912000	do a good old-fashioned rap battle.
912000	913000	I think...
914000	916000	I think, you know, rap battle...
916000	918000	I think by applause is...
918000	919000	That's for...
919000	921000	Correct me if I'm wrong, Max.
922000	923000	The whole...
923000	925000	The whole by-applause thing, that's a...
925000	928000	That's a white people Halloween party thing.
928000	932000	In a real rap battle, you know who won.
933000	934000	They don't need to...
934000	936000	I mean, I think it'll be obvious.
936000	938000	We'll know who won when we know.
938000	939000	They...
939000	940000	It's...
940000	942000	Everyone goes like, oh!
942000	943000	Oh!
944000	945000	Like...
946000	947000	It's like...
947000	948000	It hurts them.
948000	953000	Dan, I'm not trying to impugn your rapping ability, but do you think you have that in
953000	956000	you right now to elicit that sort of reaction tonight?
956000	957000	Well, I don't know.
957000	958000	I don't know.
958000	959000	For me, it's like...
959000	960000	It's not up to me.
960000	961000	It's up to God.
963000	964000	Right?
964000	969000	Because I don't want to pull rank, but I feel like that's what comes through me when I work
969000	970000	in any capacity.
970000	974000	And now, Brian, as soon as money got involved, you seem to like...
974000	975000	You're into it now.
975000	977000	I'm very poor.
978000	981000	At $40, you're gonna quit that Jamba Juice.
981000	982000	No.
983000	984000	I'm out!
986000	987000	All right, so...
987000	989000	I mean, is there any rules to, like...
989000	990000	I don't know.
990000	992000	I've never been in a three-person...
992000	993000	Dan, I'm gonna sweeten it.
993000	994000	I was joking.
994000	996000	I don't actually want to be a person.
996000	997000	I'm gonna go one more 20.
997000	998000	I got a very good rapping.
998000	999000	I'm gonna go one more 20, make it 60.
999000	1000000	Whoo!
1000000	1001000	So it's $60.
1001000	1002000	Oh, no.
1002000	1003000	Oh, my God.
1003000	1006000	If anyone else wants to make donations for this, for our rappers right here...
1007000	1009000	I'll be passing around a hat in a couple minutes.
1009000	1010000	Okay, so how does this work?
1010000	1011000	I don't know.
1011000	1012000	Are there ground rules in this?
1012000	1013000	Like, what's the thing?
1013000	1016000	I'll just throw a beat down, and you guys want to just take it?
1016000	1017000	Yeah, I guess.
1017000	1021000	I mean, I have a problem sometimes.
1021000	1025000	Like, I don't hand it off soon enough,
1025000	1028000	because sometimes the shit just is flowing.
1029000	1033000	All right, I don't even know if I would have given myself into right now, man.
1034000	1035000	All right.
1035000	1037000	It's gonna be terrible no matter what happens.
1039000	1040000	The stakes are low.
1041000	1042000	So, yeah, let's just freestyle it.
1042000	1043000	Let's just feel it out.
1043000	1044000	You guys just do your thing.
1045000	1049000	I got some new beats today that I found from some of our donation Armenian musicians.
1049000	1050000	Oh, yeah.
1050000	1052000	If you know the name of the artist, give him some credit too.
1052000	1055000	The opening song was by a cat named Lee Broderick called Level of Street.
1055000	1056000	I really like that song.
1056000	1057000	So thank you, Lee.
1057000	1058000	If you got more stuff, send it to us.
1058000	1059000	It was very cool.
1060000	1061000	I mean, we don't have to call it a battle.
1061000	1062000	We could call it a co-operative.
1062000	1063000	No, it's a fucking battle.
1063000	1064000	This is a battle.
1064000	1066000	It's a co-operative rap effort.
1066000	1067000	Yeah.
1068000	1069000	No, no.
1069000	1071000	The Sugar Hill Gang didn't battle each other.
1071000	1072000	They were a gang.
1072000	1073000	They were...
1073000	1075000	There's no animosity, no anonymity.
1075000	1077000	This is just creative collaboration.
1077000	1085000	I think rap battling is along with liquor stores and pawn shops.
1085000	1086000	Nails along.
1086000	1091000	And laissez-faire gun legislation and horoscopes and scratch-off tickets.
1091000	1094000	Scratch-off tickets are all part of the white man's...
1094000	1095000	Conspiracy.
1095000	1096000	Yeah.
1096000	1097000	Yes.
1097000	1098000	Yeah.
1098000	1099000	Oh, yeah.
1099000	1100000	Sounds like a lot of backpedaling from you, man.
1100000	1102000	I'm backpedaling on the white man's conspiracy.
1102000	1104000	I feel bad that we ever initiated it.
1104000	1105000	Yes.
1105000	1106000	I wish that we could take it back.
1106000	1107000	Okay.
1107000	1109000	During this rap battle, this rap...
1109000	1110000	Don't use that word battle.
1110000	1111000	Don't even put it in quotes.
1111000	1112000	No, no.
1112000	1113000	It's a powerful word.
1113000	1117000	This is a post-racial co-operative rap co-op.
1119000	1120000	But there will be one winner.
1120000	1121000	There will be one winner.
1121000	1122000	Somebody will win.
1122000	1123000	And this is America.
1123000	1124000	There has to be a winner.
1124000	1125000	The rap will go to...
1125000	1126000	Okay.
1126000	1129000	They're not saying the winner is anywhere.
1129000	1130000	No, no, no.
1130000	1135000	You guys are all honored just to be up on stage doing it, for certain.
1135000	1139000	But one person will walk home with 60 U.S. dollars.
1139000	1140000	Well, I don't know.
1140000	1141000	I mean, yes.
1141000	1142000	Yes, that's true.
1142000	1145000	But I don't think we have to call that person a better rapper than me.
1145000	1147000	No, I think we absolutely do.
1147000	1150000	I think when the person who has the 60 dollars can say,
1150000	1153000	among these three rappers, I am the best.
1153000	1155000	Are you in on this rap battle?
1155000	1156000	It's not a battle.
1156000	1159000	It's rap collaboration.
1159000	1161000	I mean, I'm up here.
1161000	1162000	I'm gonna be real bad at it.
1162000	1163000	That's fine.
1163000	1165000	I feel like Brian's...
1165000	1167000	He's gonna sneak in there and fucking do it.
1167000	1168000	He's his sleeper.
1168000	1170000	He's gonna come in there and promise you I'm not.
1170000	1173000	I'm gonna keep you guys honest when we start this rap battle.
1173000	1174000	Just in case.
1174000	1175000	Just in case.
1176000	1178000	So there's no hocus pocus or baloney.
1178000	1180000	In case you guys had some prepared material.
1180000	1181000	Oh, yeah.
1181000	1183000	I'm gonna solicit a suggestion.
1183000	1184000	Oh, okay.
1184000	1186000	I'll keep it vague, something very broad so you guys can...
1186000	1187000	Right.
1187000	1188000	As a starting point.
1188000	1189000	All right, Randy Quinn.
1191000	1192000	All right.
1192000	1195000	I'm gonna play a couple beats so let's see which one we'd like to use here.
1195000	1196000	What do we got?
1196000	1197000	How about...
1199000	1200000	Yeah.
1200000	1201000	Like that?
1202000	1203000	Yeah.
1204000	1205000	Yeah.
1206000	1207000	Yeah.
1207000	1208000	Yeah.
1208000	1209000	Yeah.
1209000	1210000	Yeah.
1210000	1213000	Yo, streets to the wheat.
1213000	1215000	Streets to the wheat.
1216000	1217000	Throwin' wheat in the streets.
1217000	1218000	You sir, right here.
1218000	1219000	Check.
1219000	1220000	You sir.
1220000	1221000	That was just warming up.
1221000	1223000	Streets to the wheat.
1223000	1226000	What's something that you have as a pet peeve of yours?
1226000	1227000	Something that bothers you.
1227000	1229000	Something Monday and maybe...
1229000	1230000	Streets to the wheat.
1230000	1232000	Streets to the wheat.
1233000	1235000	Whistling on the street bothers a gentleman.
1235000	1236000	Whistling on the street.
1236000	1237000	Straight whistlers.
1237000	1238000	Yeah.
1238000	1239000	Okay.
1239000	1240000	Okay.
1240000	1241000	All right.
1241000	1242000	Okay.
1242000	1243000	MC Harmon comin' to it.
1244000	1250000	Yo, why you gotta walk down the sidewalk doin' that high tone like it's bird talk?
1250000	1252000	Why you whistlin' at me?
1252000	1255000	I fucked your mama so high she took a pee.
1256000	1258000	I pulled your mama's pants down, said...
1258000	1260000	Oh, pussy whistlin'.
1260000	1261000	She's like a clown.
1261000	1262000	Clowns don't whistle.
1262000	1264000	They use seltzer bottles.
1264000	1265000	I fucked your mama so hard.
1265000	1266000	Full throttle.
1267000	1269000	Went down the street.
1270000	1272000	Squeezed your mama's tinny meat.
1273000	1277000	And gave her a kiss because in the end she's a good person.
1277000	1278000	Pass it, Mike.
1278000	1279000	Go.
1285000	1286000	All right.
1286000	1287000	Keep it goin'.
1287000	1288000	Keep the beat goin', man.
1288000	1290000	The song's not long enough for all three to get through.
1290000	1291000	So do you want to keep that beat?
1291000	1292000	Who wants to go next, man?
1292000	1293000	Oh, shit.
1293000	1294000	You have to.
1294000	1295000	You feel the fuckin'...
1295000	1296000	I use this he's standing up.
1296000	1297000	You like that beat?
1297000	1298000	You want a new beat?
1298000	1299000	Yeah, new beat.
1299000	1300000	No, same beat.
1300000	1301000	New topic.
1301000	1302000	New topic?
1302000	1303000	New topic.
1303000	1304000	Let's see.
1304000	1306000	You just fucked somebody's mama in so many ways.
1306000	1308000	And they weren't the one whistling.
1308000	1310000	They were the mother of the person whistling.
1310000	1313000	What's something that's embarrassing?
1313000	1316000	Feelings.
1316000	1317000	Feelings.
1317000	1318000	Feelings.
1318000	1319000	Feelings.
1320000	1321000	Go, Max.
1321000	1322000	Yo.
1323000	1324000	Feelings.
1324000	1325000	Yeah.
1325000	1326000	I got these feelings, man.
1326000	1327000	This awkwardness.
1327000	1330000	I'm on stage and I'm not the blackest kid.
1330000	1333000	But still, I'm kind of in the middle.
1333000	1335000	Kind of trying to spit this rap shit.
1335000	1336000	It's a riddle.
1336000	1337000	It's a mystery.
1337000	1338000	But it's nothing new to me.
1338000	1339000	It's not a diss track.
1339000	1342000	But I feel like giving kisses to Dan Harmon.
1342000	1343000	Yo.
1347000	1348000	Yo.
1348000	1349000	Yeah.
1349000	1350000	Yeah.
1351000	1352000	Harmon.
1352000	1353000	Yo.
1353000	1354000	Yeah.
1354000	1355000	Yeah, Harmon with this.
1358000	1359000	Yo.
1360000	1364000	Feeling kind of homophobic, though, because it's distracting me with my flow.
1364000	1365000	But still, I got to go.
1365000	1366000	Your beard.
1366000	1367000	Yo.
1367000	1368000	It's kind of weird.
1368000	1374000	If you was a chick and you had a dick, I'd say, yeah, she's kind of thick.
1374000	1377000	But I got to get up in it anyway.
1377000	1378000	Yeah.
1378000	1379000	Yeah.
1380000	1381000	All right.
1381000	1382000	Well, that was...
1382000	1387000	That took an unexpected turn, Max.
1391000	1394000	The title of that one is Truly Feelings.
1396000	1397000	That's right.
1397000	1404000	That was like the Charlie Kaufman of Freestyle, because he used the medium.
1404000	1406000	The rap became a feeling.
1407000	1408000	Yeah.
1408000	1409000	All right.
1409000	1410000	All right, Brian.
1410000	1412000	The bar has been maybe raised.
1413000	1414000	You want the same beat?
1414000	1415000	You want to try a new beat?
1415000	1416000	You like that one?
1417000	1418000	Your choice.
1418000	1419000	You can hear one.
1419000	1420000	Let's see what else we got here.
1420000	1421000	Let's do it.
1421000	1422000	What about...
1425000	1426000	Oh, shit.
1426000	1427000	A little more smooth.
1427000	1428000	Let's see when the beat comes in.
1428000	1429000	I feel like this.
1430000	1433000	Because you know that you love me.
1435000	1436000	Do you like this?
1437000	1438000	Or we got...
1441000	1443000	I feel like it doesn't matter.
1443000	1446000	Same result, no matter the beat.
1449000	1450000	There's that.
1450000	1451000	There's this.
1451000	1452000	Oh, shit.
1453000	1454000	I'm like a kid in a candy store.
1454000	1455000	I just get back to the first one.
1455000	1456000	Right?
1456000	1457000	You like...
1457000	1458000	That's safer, the first one.
1458000	1459000	The very first one.
1459000	1460000	The very first one they did?
1460000	1461000	The very first.
1461000	1462000	All right.
1462000	1463000	All right.
1463000	1464000	Here we go.
1464000	1465000	You good to go?
1465000	1466000	Let's get him a suggestion.
1466000	1467000	Sure.
1467000	1468000	What about...
1469000	1470000	White devil.
1470000	1472000	No, not white devil.
1472000	1473000	Unless you wanted...
1473000	1474000	Do you want...
1474000	1475000	How about just...
1475000	1476000	Can we...
1476000	1477000	How about just juice?
1477000	1478000	We'll give you juice.
1483000	1484000	Yo.
1485000	1486000	Yo.
1487000	1488000	Look at my kitchen.
1488000	1489000	Ain't got no juice.
1489000	1490000	Look at my kitchen.
1490000	1492000	What the fuck you, bitch?
1496000	1497000	That's all I got.
1497000	1500000	You got the lamest black guy up here on the spot.
1505000	1506000	White as a dove.
1506000	1509000	I'll fit inside you like a motherfucking glove.
1509000	1510000	Blue.
1515000	1517000	That's all I got.
1518000	1519000	All right.
1519000	1520000	That was...
1521000	1523000	This is not going to be easy.
1524000	1525000	This is not going to be easy.
1525000	1526000	Yeah.
1526000	1527000	All right.
1527000	1528000	Now, I mean...
1528000	1529000	That was a warm-up round.
1529000	1530000	Everybody...
1530000	1535000	Everybody, think in your heads right now silently to yourselves who you think probably won that
1535000	1536000	one.
1536000	1537000	But now I want to do...
1537000	1538000	We're going to play another beat.
1538000	1539000	This is a battle off of...
1539000	1540000	You guys are spitting it around?
1540000	1541000	We just hand it off.
1541000	1542000	Yeah.
1542000	1543000	We're like a group of friends.
1543000	1544000	Absolutely.
1548000	1551000	And this song is about what, sir?
1551000	1552000	Anything?
1552000	1553000	Yeah, anything at all.
1553000	1554000	What's...
1555000	1556000	Netflix.
1556000	1557000	It's about Netflix.
1558000	1559000	Yo.
1559000	1560000	Yo.
1560000	1561000	Yo.
1561000	1562000	Netflix.
1562000	1563000	Yo.
1563000	1564000	Yo.
1564000	1565000	On demand.
1566000	1567000	Yeah.
1567000	1568000	Yeah.
1568000	1571000	If you want to see a movie, you're going to see it.
1571000	1574000	That's how Netflix sees it.
1574000	1576000	It's their business model.
1576000	1579000	Remember when I fucked your mom in full throttle?
1579000	1580000	Whoa.
1580000	1581000	Oh, shit.
1581000	1582000	Yeah.
1582000	1583000	Yeah.
1583000	1584000	Whoa.
1584000	1585000	Yeah.
1585000	1586000	Oh.
1586000	1587000	Syncopated arrhythmic rhythms.
1587000	1591000	I fucked your mama so hard she had a schism between her legs.
1591000	1594000	It's usually called a pussy.
1594000	1595000	But I digress.
1595000	1596000	Sorry about that.
1598000	1599000	Pass it.
1599000	1600000	Pass the mic.
1600000	1604000	I'm going to pass the mic to another person.
1606000	1607000	Yo.
1607000	1608000	Yo.
1608000	1609000	Yo.
1609000	1610000	Yo.
1610000	1611000	Yeah.
1611000	1612000	Pass the mic to your man, Max.
1612000	1614000	Watch the interview on the track.
1614000	1617000	And I watch it and I watch it over and over.
1617000	1618000	I binge watch.
1618000	1624000	I watch House of Cards, The Game of Thrones, and sometimes I don't leave my home.
1624000	1627000	Got a couple cards of ice cream, Chinese food.
1627000	1628000	My mom calls me up.
1628000	1630000	I'm like, yo, I'm feeling rude.
1630000	1635000	So I hang it up and pass it up.
1635000	1636000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1636000	1637000	All right.
1637000	1638000	It's heating up here, you guys.
1638000	1639000	It's heating up.
1639000	1640000	Yeah.
1640000	1642000	Netflix called me a masturbating.
1642000	1643000	Netflix.
1643000	1644000	Oh, shit.
1644000	1645000	Satan.
1645000	1648000	Why are you asking me what I'm watching?
1648000	1649000	Yeah.
1649000	1651000	Play the Netflix, little bitch.
1651000	1652000	Yeah.
1652000	1653000	Take it home.
1653000	1654000	Yeah.
1654000	1655000	Yeah.
1655000	1656000	Yeah.
1656000	1657000	Arrested Development is coming back.
1657000	1658000	The episode is getting longer.
1658000	1659000	It's like crack.
1659000	1665000	You got to smoke one at a time, but the serialized jokes, so you get it rhymed.
1665000	1668000	You'll notice the end.
1668000	1669000	Pass the mic.
1669000	1670000	Pass the mic.
1670000	1671000	Pass the mic.
1671000	1672000	Pass the mic.
1672000	1675000	I've got to pass the mic to Max.
1675000	1678000	One of the two blacks.
1678000	1679000	Damn.
1679000	1680000	Nice.
1680000	1681000	All of it.
1681000	1686000	It's de-humanizing when you call someone a color, especially when you call them one
1686000	1687000	of the color.
1687000	1688000	Harmon.
1688000	1689000	Harmon.
1689000	1690000	Bit of a misstep.
1690000	1691000	Yeah.
1691000	1692000	Harmon.
1692000	1693000	Harmon.
1693000	1694000	Yeah.
1694000	1695000	Okay.
1695000	1696000	Yeah.
1696000	1697000	Here we go.
1697000	1698000	Last name, Harmon.
1698000	1701000	I don't know what that still means, but it's white.
1701000	1707000	I won't say what rhymes with white, but still, you know what it's like to be on stage and
1707000	1709000	get called, put on blast.
1710000	1714000	Sometimes I watch Netflix for hours just trying to pick the show.
1714000	1715000	I don't know what to do.
1715000	1720000	I read all the titles and they all sound interesting, so.
1720000	1721000	All right.
1721000	1722000	Pass the mic.
1722000	1723000	Pass the mic.
1723000	1726000	Bring it home, Brian.
1726000	1727000	Netflix.
1727000	1729000	I don't know what to watch.
1729000	1730000	Netflix.
1730000	1733000	Why am I touching my crotch?
1733000	1734000	Netflix.
1734000	1736000	What the fuck is going on?
1737000	1739000	I can't even see her phone.
1739000	1740000	Is this censored?
1740000	1742000	Fuck you, Netflix.
1743000	1744000	All right.
1744000	1745000	All right.
1745000	1746000	All right.
1746000	1748000	That was $60 worth of rapping.
1748000	1753000	I feel like shit almost got too real there.
1753000	1756000	We were in danger of crossing into dangerous reality.
1756000	1761000	We definitely made connections tonight and I think made a good case for more black people
1761000	1762000	coming to my shows.
1762000	1764000	I think we just fixed racism.
1764000	1765000	Yeah.
1765000	1767000	I mean, and it's surprising how little time it took.
1767000	1768000	We've been working on it forever.
1768000	1770000	It's like, let me out there.
1770000	1772000	Let me take care of this.
1772000	1778000	Is there any, since you guys were so gracious and put yourselves out there, is there anything?
1778000	1783000	I mean, usually we ask the professional people what they're plugging, but you guys are plugging
1783000	1785000	your young lives.
1786000	1791000	If anybody out there is hiring people who don't have any experience writing television
1791000	1795000	shoes, please call me.
1795000	1796000	All right.
1796000	1798000	You can go to Brian's Jamba Juice.
1798000	1801000	Go to your nearest Jamba Juice and ask for me.
1801000	1806000	I'm the only black person that works at any Jamba Juice ever.
1806000	1813000	Max, if there's a guy sitting in Seattle that goes, that's it.
1813000	1816000	That's the new face of Chipotle.
1818000	1820000	You're correct, sir.
1822000	1825000	And he can find you on LinkedIn or whatever.
1825000	1826000	All right.
1826000	1827000	Now, how do we decide this?
1827000	1828000	Now, this is the...
1828000	1835000	Oh, well, I mean, I think it's a tie between the two guys whose money it isn't.
1838000	1841000	I mean, I'm not going to take my own money, but I clearly won.
1844000	1846000	My shit was tight.
1847000	1850000	I'm going to say you came in a very close third, Dan.
1851000	1852000	Very close third.
1852000	1854000	Beat out M&M.
1854000	1856000	We don't need to decide between the two of them, right?
1856000	1859000	We can just split the 60 among the two guys.
1859000	1860000	I made it even 80.
1860000	1861000	How about 40 for both of them?
1861000	1862000	Is that cool?
1863000	1864000	All right.
1865000	1866000	All right.
1866000	1873000	That buys a lot of Jamba Juice and a lot of, I don't know, acting tutorials.
1873000	1874000	Chipotle burritos.
1874000	1876000	Just goes to rent.
1877000	1878000	All right.
1878000	1879000	Well, thanks, Max.
1880000	1885000	Keep coming back and bring friends.
1885000	1887000	They can be white friends.
1890000	1891000	It's working, Jeff.
1891000	1892000	It's working.
1892000	1895000	This show brought to you by Jamba Juice.
1896000	1899000	I bet you thought it was absurd when I asked for...
1899000	1902000	I just requested black people to come to the show.
1902000	1904000	You thought I was silly.
1904000	1905000	You thought I was racist.
1906000	1909000	Racist like a fox.
1916000	1918000	I'm bringing back...
1918000	1920000	I'm pre-racial.
1920000	1922000	That's my movement.
1922000	1923000	Pre-racial.
1923000	1926000	So you live in a time before racism really kicked off?
1926000	1927000	Yeah.
1927000	1930000	Race is an artificial construct, but that's why it's so fascinating.
1931000	1932000	Remember Jamal?
1932000	1933000	Jamal's not here, is he?
1933000	1934000	Jamal, you're here?
1935000	1936000	He would have spoke up.
1937000	1940000	I wanted to talk to Jamal at the end of the show last time.
1940000	1943000	Because he was sort of the quintessential post-racial kid.
1943000	1946000	He looked like he was about 12 years old.
1946000	1947000	Very adorable.
1947000	1951000	Very, very bored with my racial obsession, making fun of me.
1951000	1954000	Kind of just didn't need it.
1954000	1956000	Had no use for the consciousness of race.
1956000	1958000	It would have been fun to have him come up every week
1958000	1961000	and just check in with him, do a post-racial update.
1961000	1962000	And he would just say,
1963000	1965000	What kind?
1966000	1969000	All right, well, that was a strange detour,
1969000	1971000	but that's what Harmon Town's about.
1971000	1972000	It's about magic.
1974000	1976000	Oh, I think we've proven that.
1977000	1980000	If our next guest had anything to say about it,
1980000	1983000	he'd probably say the show is about waiting a long time
1983000	1985000	for weird raps to happen.
1987000	1989000	Let's bring out Greg Proops!
1993000	1997000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1999000	2001000	Greg Proops, yeah.
2002000	2003000	Yeah.
2004000	2007000	I'm a beamer, smokin' whack.
2008000	2010000	Just watchin' Netflix.
2010000	2012000	It's the orange to the black one.
2012000	2013000	Yeah.
2013000	2015000	But I can watch Yahoo with impunity
2015000	2018000	because that's the place that they got community.
2022000	2024000	I had time to think of that.
2025000	2027000	That's all I fuckin' came up with.
2027000	2030000	You couldn't make yourself 40 cool dollars, man.
2030000	2031000	I know, man.
2031000	2033000	And then I could equip my job and shit.
2034000	2035000	How are you, Prippy?
2035000	2036000	Oh, you want some ice?
2036000	2037000	I'm good, yeah, I do, thank you.
2037000	2038000	Greg, I like that you came out
2038000	2039000	and brought a brand new bottle of vodka.
2039000	2042000	I was asked by two people backstage if I might do so,
2042000	2045000	and I acquiesced to both of them, one after the next.
2045000	2046000	The first guy went,
2046000	2047000	When you go out there, will you bring a bottle of vodka?
2047000	2048000	Yeah, two seconds later, another guy went,
2048000	2049000	Will you bring a bottle?
2049000	2051000	I'm like, How many people want me to bring vodka?
2051000	2053000	And the answer's yes to all of you.
2054000	2055000	I rarely get asked a question
2055000	2057000	and I'm so enthusiastic about answering yes to.
2057000	2059000	Because the smartest man in the world,
2059000	2062000	podcast, is known more colloquially as a vodcast
2062000	2064000	because it's fueled by vodka, if I'm not mistaken.
2064000	2066000	It is, in fact, fueled by vodka,
2066000	2070000	much as jets are fueled by whatever, jets are fueled by.
2071000	2073000	My show is fueled by vodka.
2073000	2075000	Or fueled, if you wish to pronounce all the letters in a word.
2075000	2076000	I don't.
2076000	2078000	I think it's jet fuel.
2078000	2079000	Jet fuel.
2079000	2080000	Jet fuel, of course.
2080000	2083000	That's what jets use to go from one place to another.
2084000	2088000	Like rocket fuel for rockets and whatnot.
2089000	2090000	Speaking of rocket fuel.
2093000	2094000	So, all right.
2096000	2097000	I'm well, thank you for asking, Jeff.
2097000	2098000	Good to see you, Greg.
2098000	2103000	So, you have a podcast called The Smartest Man in the World.
2103000	2105000	You're more erudite than I am.
2105000	2106000	You're a learned man.
2106000	2107000	You're a smart man.
2107000	2108000	I wouldn't say that, no.
2108000	2112000	You're coming out with a book, The Smartest Book in the World.
2112000	2113000	Yes.
2113000	2114000	You're a smart person.
2114000	2115000	It's all a joke, by the way.
2115000	2117000	Everyone's so serious right now.
2117000	2118000	Greg?
2118000	2121000	They heard the word erudite and everyone fucking panicked and shit.
2121000	2124000	If this was a radio, they'd be hitting seek really hard right now.
2125000	2126000	Greg, what's your book about?
2126000	2127000	About 300 pages.
2127000	2128000	Thank you for asking.
2129000	2131000	Jeff Davis, ladies and gentlemen.
2133000	2134000	Yeah.
2134000	2135000	Oh, no.
2135000	2136000	It's The Bounce Pass all the way.
2136000	2137000	I don't even look behind me.
2137000	2138000	You know what I mean?
2138000	2139000	Because I know what's coming.
2139000	2149000	Have either of you guys post 30, like well into the era of everyone's got a phone on
2149000	2150000	their camera.
2150000	2154000	Like, don't think about when you were 17 or anything.
2154000	2162000	Have either of you, since the advent of the phone camera, taken a shit so big that even
2162000	2168000	though you knew you were never going to show it to anybody, it was so big that you took
2168000	2174000	a picture of your own shit just because you were about to flush it.
2174000	2179000	And you knew, I mean, I can't stress enough, like I suppose you've guessed by now this
2179000	2182000	happened to me recently.
2182000	2187000	I will never show it to anybody because it's gross.
2187000	2191000	But I would never want to look at a picture of anyone else's shit.
2191000	2197000	There's websites where people post pictures of shit and stuff.
2197000	2198000	I wasn't aware of that.
2198000	2202000	I'm often looking at the rainbow bright website, so I'm a little prissy.
2202000	2204000	Either of you guys ever?
2204000	2206000	I've never been moved to actually reach for the phone.
2206000	2211000	There have been times when I've astonished myself, but I didn't know that it needed to
2211000	2213000	be recorded.
2213000	2217000	Well, don't mistake me for saying like, oh, anytime you take a big shit, you should always
2218000	2223000	... I'm saying like, that's the thing about it is like, as my picture snapped, I was like,
2223000	2225000	I'm not going to show this picture to anybody.
2225000	2228000	I'm taking this picture because that's how big the shit is.
2228000	2232000	And I'm 42, and I take huge shits all the time.
2232000	2233000	All the time.
2233000	2237000	And then I thought, I have to ... I'm not going to share the picture with anybody.
2237000	2238000	The picture's for me.
2238000	2243000	But also, I just want to tell people I took the biggest shit of my life.
2243000	2244000	I'm 42.
2244000	2245000	I took the biggest shit.
2245000	2246000	Thanks, guys.
2247000	2250000	So Greg, you were in Paris recently, right?
2250000	2251000	Done.
2251000	2252000	Last year.
2252000	2257000	No, I've never been tempted, but I can understand the impulse.
2257000	2262000	For me, it's like I'm in airports all the time, and there's always guys on the commode,
2262000	2267000	as it were, having long conversations with their loved ones while they're doing the thing.
2267000	2269000	And to me, that's ... Gross.
2269000	2270000	Gross.
2270000	2273000	There's a time and a place for everything, and a conversation doesn't take place while
2273000	2275000	you're eliminating.
2275000	2279000	I've never wanted to take a picture of my wand, and I've never wanted to take a picture
2279000	2280000	of any excrement.
2280000	2281000	But that's me.
2281000	2282000	I'm a sissy.
2282000	2288000	I mean, you're a bold Viking who fucking forges forward and breaks through post-racial barriers
2288000	2293000	and gets people from Jamba Juice on stage and gives them money.
2293000	2299000	So I can understand why your eliminatory system might be a matter of some pride.
2299000	2300000	I didn't feel brave.
2300000	2302000	I felt cowardly as I was taking the picture.
2302000	2308000	I felt like the chimpanzees in the beginning of 2001.
2308000	2311000	I'm scared of this giant thing.
2311000	2312000	What's the giant black thing that came out of it?
2312000	2313000	Yeah.
2313000	2317000	If those things had cameras, they would have those australopithecines.
2317000	2319000	They would have snapped a pic of the monolith.
2319000	2320000	All right.
2320000	2321000	Anyways, it took a huge shit.
2321000	2322000	I mean, it was a hockey stick.
2322000	2323000	Okay.
2323000	2327000	But was it in the shape ... If it had been in the shape of a monolith, then I might consider
2327000	2328000	it.
2328000	2331000	If it had come out as a perfect rectangle, I might think.
2331000	2332000	This is just ... You know what?
2332000	2333000	This isn't history anymore.
2333000	2334000	This is science.
2334000	2335000	Yeah.
2335000	2339000	Because we've gone to Neil deGrasse Tyson territory here.
2339000	2344000	The odds of taking a rectangular shit are one in one billion, and yet Dan Harmon achieved
2344000	2349000	it four times last week after visiting the Fatburger on Santa Monica Avenue.
2349000	2355000	I don't even know what I did, and I didn't experience anything untoward on the toilet.
2355000	2356000	It was like a normal experience.
2356000	2357000	Smooth sailing, yeah.
2357000	2363000	I was just sitting there thinking about Xanadu or whatever, and then I just got off, and
2363000	2366000	I looked down, and it was like, this is remarkable.
2366000	2367000	Amazing.
2367000	2368000	Okay.
2368000	2369000	We don't have to talk about it.
2369000	2370000	It's a conversation that goes nowhere.
2370000	2372000	I only wanted to talk about the relationship.
2372000	2377000	Did you ever see the South Park episode where the dad takes the giant shit, and they do
2377000	2378000	a whole episode?
2378000	2385280	I mean, there is something about ... It's an exploration of a thing that's always going
2385280	2386280	on.
2387040	2389400	You don't want to talk to other people about your shit.
2389400	2392280	Some people still tell each other about their dreams.
2392280	2395800	You know who you are.
2395800	2396800	Even that's not so great.
2396800	2400720	Of course, talking about your shit in the minutia, it's like, oh, gross.
2400720	2404600	I don't like that when people go like, oh, it was like a pebble, but it had a stick on
2404600	2405600	the end.
2405600	2410080	I don't want to picture your shit, but at the same time, I think there's something interesting
2410080	2418800	about the fact that we do so few things every day, and there's so few of those things that
2418800	2425400	we do every day that we never really talk about, and we really have a relationship with.
2425400	2427400	It was the biggest shit of my life.
2427400	2431520	I've only been married once, and I've only taken this big a shit once.
2431520	2437840	I haven't had a baby yet, but it seemed like I did when I ... All right, that's it.
2437840	2438840	That's it.
2439600	2441280	You didn't call 911 or anything?
2441280	2444200	No, I took a picture, and I just went upstairs and ...
2444200	2445200	Hey, Greg.
2445200	2446200	Thanks for coming.
2446200	2447200	Greg Proops, everybody.
2447200	2455920	To the H and to the A and to the ... All right, okay, so that's the gross segment
2455920	2456920	of the show.
2456920	2464560	I had another thing about ... I always wondered about the recycle bin, if you blow your nose
2464560	2465800	and then ... Right.
2465800	2466800	Is it still recycling?
2466800	2467800	Is it?
2467800	2468800	Or is it garbage?
2468920	2469920	Are you supposed to put it in there?
2469920	2474200	And then I always picture a shoe box made out of recycled materials, and it's like,
2474200	2476760	are my bookers somehow a part of the box?
2476760	2477760	Right.
2477760	2481320	Is the last part of the coleslaw in the cardboard thing still recycling, or is it garbage?
2481320	2483280	Because it's got the organic matter.
2483280	2484280	You recycle tissues?
2484280	2486280	Well, you're supposed to.
2486280	2488040	He takes pictures of his shit, Jeff.
2488040	2493160	There's really unlimited possibilities as to what he recycles at this point.
2493160	2498160	You're supposed to throw out your discarded paper products?
2498200	2499920	You can blow your nose and throw that in the recycle bin?
2499920	2503600	Well, I mean, it's not like being ... I mean, well, this is a question.
2503600	2507520	I mean, I ... I always hover over the two things, because
2507520	2508520	I'm like, well ... I'll answer it.
2508520	2509720	I'll go garbage on that.
2509720	2513600	Because people have to pick through the recycling, and they certainly don't want to feel your
2513600	2515680	excretions.
2515680	2516680	There's a human being.
2516680	2521840	There's like a jawa that goes through every ... They don't just put it in like a puddle
2521840	2522840	of bleach or something.
2522840	2526640	For someone who's just had two black people up here, your understanding of what the underclass
2526800	2530960	has to do is rather limited, I would think, in this regard, Dan.
2530960	2535880	Yes, people have to go through every manner of batch that ...
2535880	2537600	The recycling bin gets dumped out.
2537600	2542320	Well, take me through from the blue bin, goes into the truck, and then they take that one
2542320	2544400	to ... Right. Two Austrian men, one's named Franz,
2544400	2548800	the other I don't know his name, take it to an area outside of Pomona, California, where
2548800	2552960	it's dumped into a giant refuse pile, much like the volcano in Mordor.
2552960	2559520	And on the sides of this, it's much like that movie from several years ago, the one
2559520	2562960	with all the Indian children that won the Oscar for being the one that ...
2562960	2563960	Slumdog Millionaire?
2563960	2571520	Right, yeah, Slumdog Millionaire, where it made people feel awful and therefore good.
2571520	2573680	Because it was in color and there was dancing and whatnot.
2573680	2580520	And so all the excreta, effluvium, errata, and jetsam that the world perpetrates, someone
2580520	2584160	has to go through each piece of it to see if there's any value to it and then they either
2584160	2589120	put it in a bag and take it to a community where they sell it or it goes into a big giant
2589120	2591720	furnace that's marked Big Devil.
2591720	2593640	And that's how recycling works.
2593640	2598000	But you're talking about ... I mean, we have a de facto lair in there where the ...
2598000	2602280	I am, of course, bullshitting at all times, but I would appreciate it if you'd maintain
2602280	2604880	your respectful silence.
2604880	2608560	Because there are homeless people that go through and they go through the bins and then
2608560	2609560	they go like, oh, they're ...
2609600	2614160	I prefer the term indigenous street people, but yes.
2614160	2615160	And they grab the stuff ...
2615160	2618680	Homeless infers that everyone gets a home, which is, as I think our friend who works
2618680	2623160	at Jamba Juice will attest, when you're a wage slave, no home is given to you.
2623160	2628120	The idea of home and homeless is a fairly ... I think George Carlin worked that point
2628120	2629120	over pretty patatically.
2629120	2635920	Don't you think ... I still honestly, all the shit that goes in the paper bin, I don't
2635920	2641000	picture one human being going like, ah, this paper's got chocolate on it.
2641000	2642960	It's a crew of people and they ...
2642960	2646600	I don't know the ruling on this, but you can't blow your nose and recycle that.
2646600	2647600	That just seems ...
2647600	2648600	Thank you.
2648600	2649600	Thank you.
2649600	2650600	That's a no.
2650600	2651600	At the very least, it's impolite.
2651600	2656840	Well, does that ... But then you put your cardboard pizza box in there, right?
2656840	2657840	It's got cheese all over it.
2657840	2662880	Yeah, but think about it.
2662880	2665920	You put things that are recyclable in there, like the things that ... It's like recycle
2665920	2669560	this plastic, recycle the things with a little symbol on it, like things ... And ideally,
2669560	2670640	you clean them first.
2670640	2672760	You rinse them off and you put those in the recycle bin.
2672760	2676640	You don't just put anything that conceivably could be recycled in the recycle bin.
2676640	2683240	Well, I'm sure I'm not the person to be letting you in on this, but we have gone recycled
2683240	2689360	crazy to the point where there is often no actual refuse container in offices and stuff.
2689360	2693440	In the writer's bungalow at work, there is no non-recycling.
2693440	2697640	There's four giant cardboard boxes that all have the recycling symbol on it.
2697640	2700000	Is there one for compost or something like that?
2700000	2703800	There's just four big giant fucking boxes that all have that symbol on it.
2703800	2706960	I don't want to be a libertarian here, but it's the dirty little secret that this shit
2706960	2711960	just goes into a fucking pile with everything else, because the stuff that we're putting
2711960	2716800	in these boxes, it's like, oh yeah, this is where the plastic and the paper and the cardboard
2716800	2717800	and ...
2717800	2718800	Yeah, but it's to make people feel better about themselves.
2718800	2719800	It's an exercise.
2719800	2724120	It's a charade, like a lot of stuff we do, like security at the airport and shit like
2724120	2725120	that.
2725120	2726120	And most of our waste is like ...
2726120	2728720	Oh, well, let's do this, and then we'll pretend that it's really happening and white people
2728720	2730720	are happy and everyone goes home.
2730720	2733120	But you're saying there's still some guy picking through it.
2733120	2734320	That's not just a guy going through this.
2734320	2735320	Absolutely.
2735320	2738040	You ever drive down the streets of LA and see people digging in the garbage cans and
2738040	2739680	pulling out Burger King wrappers and shit like that?
2739680	2742720	I guarantee you, no matter what's happening, I don't want to bring it down to a bummer
2742720	2746320	level where all your nice, lower-middle-class fans are bummed out.
2746320	2748640	We're talking about two different things, though.
2748640	2749640	You're talking about people ...
2749640	2750920	They're like, fuck, I don't even have healthcare.
2750920	2753760	I'm two paychecks away from going through a Burger King fucking wrapper.
2753760	2754760	You're talking about ...
2754760	2756680	Because that's how they talk to themselves.
2756680	2760000	Everyone's internal monologue in this room is kind of like this.
2760000	2761000	You're talking about ...
2761000	2762000	I'm from Daytona.
2762000	2763560	I don't know why everything's like this.
2763560	2767680	I understand that there's people that go through the garbage cans that then take stuff to the
2767680	2770840	recycling center, the stuff that they ... I understand there's people that go through
2770840	2774400	my garbage that are scavengers from Sector 7.
2774400	2775520	I get that.
2775880	2776880	I admire those people.
2776880	2781600	It's amazing that they're like bothering to find the honest labor, quote-unquote, honest
2781600	2784480	labor that's afforded to their situation.
2784480	2785760	It blows my mind.
2785760	2786760	Spencer only gives those people money.
2786760	2787880	He doesn't give panhandlers money.
2787880	2791600	He pulls over and randomly runs up to those people and gives them money because they're
2791600	2795840	like ... He has some ... It's like, yeah, you want to encourage the ones that are doing
2795840	2796840	it, whatever.
2796840	2797840	I don't know.
2797840	2798840	Wow.
2798840	2803520	He labors under the false notion that this world is a meritocracy in some way, and that
2803520	2805360	can be enforced even at the lowest level.
2805360	2808040	But I'm talking about at the place.
2808040	2810080	I don't know where this stuff goes.
2810080	2812960	I know where the whole ... There are people ... I've watched as modern
2812960	2816760	marvels and things like that, where there's a guy or a gal at a conveyor belt, and they're
2816760	2819760	looking for this we need, that goes along the thing.
2819760	2822760	They're actually ... There are sorters at the end.
2822760	2823760	They're just pulling stuff.
2823760	2827240	There's also a giant plastic island in the South Pacific that bobs up and down and has
2827240	2831080	a couple of kilometers wide and ... Yeah, we should be able to start building
2831080	2832080	on that pretty soon, right?
2832080	2834600	Dan, I've talked about it on another show.
2834840	2836560	I want to talk about it on this show.
2836560	2840080	We need to do harm in town from the garbage island.
2840080	2841080	It's out in the South Pacific.
2841080	2842160	I don't know how we get there.
2842160	2843360	I think you fly.
2843360	2846720	There's no birds or fish anymore, but at a certain point in the South Pacific when you
2846720	2850000	get out there, there's a giant bunch of birds and fish because the garbage is there, and
2850000	2851000	you're like ... It's an ecosystem.
2851000	2852000	Right.
2852000	2854160	Yeah, there's all kinds of ... You probably can't walk on it, though, right?
2854160	2855160	It's not ... No, sure you could.
2855160	2860200	It's nothing but six-pack plastic things and containers and styrofoam and whatnot, and
2860200	2865680	old tissues and jamba juice cups that people threw away in LA that got caught in a tsunami
2865680	2868400	tide and shot across the Pacific and stuff.
2868400	2871760	I think it's going to be solid enough in another six months or so that we can do a fucking
2871760	2873360	benefit for it.
2873360	2876960	What if that ends up being the new world?
2876960	2879680	What if that is where ... Hawaii was three million years ago, whatever,
2879680	2880680	or Iceland.
2880680	2883200	Now, the garbage island is the new paradigm, and we all ...
2883200	2887640	It's like where all the intelligentsia live, and they form a perfect government, right?
2887640	2891320	I'm going to move there like Arthur Clarke moved to Ceylon, and I'm going to write my
2891320	2895720	next novel there, and by that time, there'll be mammals and monkeys and whatnot, living
2895720	2900200	on the garbage island as well, and fauna and flora, and there'll be palm trees growing
2900200	2901400	out of nowhere and whatnot.
2901400	2904600	Nature finds a way.
2904600	2908880	If we've learned nothing, we've learned that Jeff Goldblum's absolutely right in the movie
2908880	2911640	Jurassic Park.
2911640	2912640	Nature does find a way.
2912640	2915720	There's so many movies he's right in, and Independence Day is one, but the other one
2915720	2917120	is Jurassic Park.
2917120	2922640	If you can get an Apple Mac to interface with an alien craft like he does in Independence
2922640	2924720	Day, that is some feat of technology.
2924720	2926480	Was he right in powder, Greg?
2926480	2927480	In powder?
2927480	2928480	In powder.
2928480	2929480	Was he right?
2929480	2930480	Oh, fuck.
2930480	2931480	Jeff ... When is Jeff Goldblum wrong?
2931480	2936960	He's right at ... He's right ... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2936960	2940600	I hear a grown man, but inside a frightened girl.
2940600	2942600	Wait, but they're right.
2942600	2943600	He was wrong on the fly.
2943600	2944600	He fucking ... Oh, on the fly he was.
2944600	2945600	He was wrong on the fly.
2945600	2947640	He was wrong on the fly, but you know what he was right about?
2947640	2951360	He married Gina Davis while he made that movie, so he was right about that.
2951360	2954400	Well, okay, but the thing about the fly is it's a tragedy.
2954400	2959120	It's like Macbeth, so Macbeth was right about killing the king, making him king.
2959120	2962480	Well, he made a deal with the devil, didn't he, though?
2962480	2963480	There's the rub.
2963480	2968040	Right, but I'm saying, Goldblum is always at his best when he's right about something.
2968040	2972520	In a tragic movie like that, a sci-fi horror movie that ends with him getting a Sorry Kids,
2972520	2978200	getting his brains blown out, he's right the whole time.
2978200	2979200	He's even right.
2979200	2981400	He even goes, now it's time to blow my brain down.
2981400	2984520	Right, but he has a conscience in that one and all that jazz.
2984520	2986880	He often does, though.
2986880	2990880	He's like a Goldblum.
2990880	2991880	You know what I mean?
2991880	2998240	All right, so I think that ... Well, he's married now, so all the women in
2998240	3000560	the room are safe for the moment.
3000560	3002480	He was roaming around L.A. like he's doing this.
3002480	3005240	He almost hurtled me, like I ... Oh, yeah.
3005240	3006240	He's my height or taller.
3006240	3007240	Oh, no.
3007240	3008240	He's quite tall, yeah.
3008240	3011360	And I was at a thing ... On a date with some girl, it wasn't like a hot date, it was just
3011360	3012360	a girl I knew.
3012360	3016520	We went to go see him play at the Argyle Hotel, which is now called the Sunset ... Whatever
3016520	3017520	the fuck.
3017520	3022960	But we went and saw him, and I was in the men's room, and there was a men's room attendant,
3022960	3026160	and so I was washing my hands, and there's Jeff Goldblum, and the men's room attendant,
3026160	3028920	his sign says, thank you, my name is Jeff.
3028920	3031880	So I'm washing my hands, and that's Jeff Goldblum, and there's a guy named Jeff, and
3031880	3033440	I said, wow, my name's Jeff, too.
3033440	3038200	I said, you know, meteor hits his bathroom, that takes care of a lot of the Jeff's building.
3038200	3049160	And Goldblum looks at me and goes, oh, yeah, yeah.
3049160	3055440	So we walk outside, and I'm with some girl, and she's good looking, kind of, and I introduce
3055440	3058440	him to her, because now we've had that moment.
3058440	3063800	And I introduce her, and this is another Jeff, and he talks to this girl, and never, ever,
3063800	3069760	ever takes her eyes off of her tits, and then later, like, he ... if he could have walked
3069760	3073920	through me, like, at the Adams, could have aligned, or he could have actually passed
3073920	3075440	through me, because that would have been faster ...
3075440	3077440	Quantum leap, or something.
3077440	3078440	Yes.
3078440	3081920	If he could have just completely, like, osmotically ...
3081920	3087720	Just de-stockwell your ass, and just ... It's now five minutes from now, and I just walk
3087720	3088720	through you.
3088720	3089720	Yeah.
3089720	3091360	You can get creepy to the point where you transcend physics.
3091360	3092360	It's true, though.
3092360	3093360	It's true.
3093360	3099200	I've seen him in ... If we took an informal poll of every woman in this room, he's hit
3099200	3102320	on every woman, I think, on Earth.
3102320	3108200	For sure there is, there's 150 people in this room, maybe, or am I flattering myself?
3108200	3113760	Let's assume that half of them are not women, because it's harm in town, and it's more like ...
3113760	3116400	Well, maybe, yeah.
3116400	3117400	You're right.
3117400	3120040	I'm just beating your observation dead.
3120040	3124800	The number of women that I have talked to that have a Jeff Goldblum story, specifically
3124800	3128840	about his sort of ... I don't want to use hot button language, like predatory, or anything.
3128840	3130400	No, no, he's not predatory.
3130400	3131840	I've done a couple gigs with him.
3131840	3135920	I used to have him on my chat show a couple times, and he was absolutely charming, and
3135920	3139880	really lovable, and fucking just was ceaseless.
3139880	3144120	But you know that old saying, when you're a teenager, guys say to you, if you hit on
3144120	3148360	every girl, eventually one old couple ... You can't hit if you don't swing, man.
3148360	3149360	Right.
3149360	3154040	He's the only person next to Bill Clinton who's actually observed that philosophy.
3154040	3155040	You know what I mean?
3155040	3156040	Most guys don't.
3156040	3160320	Most guys don't hit on every single girl they meet, but Jeff Goldblum and Bill Clinton,
3160320	3162440	I think, are like, hey, how's it going?
3162440	3165480	Then every woman goes, no, and pushes them away, and they're like, fine, I'm on to the
3165480	3166480	next one.
3166480	3167480	But he also has a thing.
3167480	3168480	It's not a thing.
3168480	3175160	He has that really animal sexual drive, where when he sees a woman, it's laser beam lock,
3175160	3176400	like target lock on them.
3176400	3177400	Oh yeah, like the predator.
3177400	3178400	Just heat.
3178400	3179400	Yeah.
3179400	3180400	Yeah.
3180400	3183400	Pink, pink, pink.
3183400	3194760	You are one ugly bastard.
3194760	3198240	Blender of predator references there.
3198240	3202040	The predator was hunting the person, but then he was Arnold Schwarzenegger.
3202040	3205120	I changed characters in the middle of it.
3205120	3209040	My scenes have a lot of jump cuts in them.
3209040	3211040	It's not complex as much as it is perplexing.
3211040	3215480	Also, I got nearly ... I think you could call it a cross check, a hip check.
3215480	3218320	I'm not sure what the correct hockey term is.
3218320	3220000	Bruce Willis went through me.
3220000	3223640	He actually dozed me over to get to a girl.
3223640	3224640	Wow.
3225520	3230000	He saw a girl, and this is like my first girlfriend that I was ever in love with, and I was like
3230000	3235160	early 20s, and she looked enough like Demi Moore for me to get it.
3235160	3239360	She certainly was in his zone, and he came out of the men's room at this club in Hollywood
3239360	3246080	and saw her from across the way, and there was various sofas and human beings and like
3246080	3249960	Mario obstacles, like things for him to ...
3255960	3261720	There was various Donkey Kong barrels rolling at him, but he had to get through, and he
3261720	3267400	saw her from across the room at about, let's call it like, let's say 30 feet, 40 feet,
3267400	3275920	and looked and saw like Robocop, saw the lay of the land, like sofa, 1.5 meters high, like
3275920	3276920	charting a course.
3276920	3280240	She was four meters high?
3280240	3286680	The sofa was 1.4 meters, and he looked around and said, it'll take so long to walk around
3286680	3291840	like a human, like a person would through affairs of traffic, a person might walk to
3291840	3293760	get from one point to another in a bar.
3293760	3297720	He just started jumping over and climbing over, like stepping on people's coats.
3297720	3298720	Wow.
3298720	3300400	He was that desperate to get to her.
3300400	3304760	Beeline, and then he went, kaboom, right into me, and I kind of saw him coming.
3304760	3305800	I saw him coming.
3305800	3310360	I saw this all happening, and I turned to my girlfriend, and the next thing I know,
3310360	3313840	I see him, and he's right on me, and just goes, it just knocks me, like not all the
3313840	3314840	way to the ground, but nearly.
3314840	3315840	Wow.
3315840	3316840	Yeah.
3316840	3318960	Was this Hudson Hawk era or Pulp Fiction?
3318960	3319960	It's after Hudson Hawk.
3319960	3321320	Oh, he was like racing.
3321320	3322760	He was like, my hair's falling out.
3322760	3323760	Yeah.
3323760	3328400	He didn't know how sexy he was going to get when it finished falling out.
3328400	3331200	He was still airbrushing it out of his head for $40 million.
3331200	3332200	This is die hard.
3332200	3333200	Yeah.
3333200	3334200	Yeah.
3334200	3335200	First three.
3335600	3336600	Hey, come over here.
3337600	3338600	Let's just lose you.
3342120	3345960	But Hudson Hawk, yeah, he was like vaulting, like bringing her to Seagrams.
3346480	3347480	All right.
3348520	3349520	They don't even know.
3349520	3350520	They don't even remember.
3351040	3352200	I've had a few guys do it.
3352200	3353200	It's pretty desperate.
3353200	3353760	Yeah.
3353760	3354760	I've had one or two.
3354760	3358280	I can't say their names, but I've had one or two guys just, you know, basically knock
3358280	3360400	you down because there was something there.
3360400	3364760	I got run over by Nicholas Cage one time in New Orleans.
3364760	3369640	But he came absolutely careening out of an elevator in New Orleans.
3369640	3371280	And it wasn't because he was trying to get anywhere.
3371280	3372280	He just came out.
3372280	3375120	I was like, I just came out of the elevator.
3375120	3377120	And I was a guy waiting in the elevator.
3377120	3381120	He was like, oh, sorry, man.
3381120	3382120	Ah!
3382120	3385120	So many floors in this building.
3385120	3392040	I've been like, bend to every one.
3392040	3394040	No.
3394040	3395400	I don't begrudge him for that.
3395400	3399920	We all wanted what he was having that night because he looked so I love that.
3399920	3402040	I've never loved to be near.
3402040	3407640	My friend, Tom Kenny, told me that he was at Johnny Ramon's funeral and over at Hollywood
3407640	3411880	Forever and Nicholas Cage was very good friends with Johnny Ramon.
3411880	3415480	And he goes, he wore a Matrix outfit, a long black coat and shades.
3415480	3416960	And he goes, everybody got up and spoke.
3416960	3422480	And then Nicholas Cage went, Johnny, if you're up there, I know you can hear us.
3422480	3430080	I want Nicholas Cage at my funeral.
3430080	3431520	I don't even care if I can't see it.
3431520	3437800	I want him to be there and go, Greg, it's fucking yes.
3437800	3443080	Rockin' good news.
3443080	3444080	So fantastic.
3444080	3447720	That would be great if you could just request that as soon as it blew people's minds.
3447720	3448720	I don't even know him.
3448720	3458360	He could probably charge for that the same way that they sell like the cryogenic freezing
3458360	3459360	companies.
3459360	3460360	Like those are all scams.
3460360	3461360	It's like, well, who's going to sue you?
3461360	3463840	You know, your head's in a bucket.
3463840	3468920	So Nick Cage could make you, he could go, yeah, a million dollars, I'll do your eulogy.
3468920	3478000	He has to wear a, wait a second, Dan, Dan, I've known you for a long time.
3478000	3479760	I didn't know you did a great Nicholas Cage.
3479760	3480760	I know.
3480760	3484720	Now it's all of a sudden it's like face off and shit.
3484720	3487240	You're John Travolta in face off, man.
3487240	3489640	I know, I know, I know, I know.
3489640	3490640	It's really good.
3490640	3491640	It's just, you know.
3491640	3492640	It's just quite good.
3492640	3499160	You just, it's, you do the Gary Busey overbite and then you raise it an octave.
3499160	3500160	So Gary Busey.
3500160	3501160	Oh, Nicholas Cage!
3501160	3502160	I think.
3503160	3504160	I think.
3504160	3505160	Yeah.
3505160	3509160	Like I kind of do it by like, think it, because it's like, like, like, like, like, this is
3509160	3510160	Don Knotts.
3510160	3512160	I'm Don Knotts!
3512160	3514160	But then this is Bill Clinton.
3514160	3516160	I'm Bill Clinton.
3516160	3519160	Like a lethal weapon.
3519160	3522160	That is a lethal weapon.
3522160	3523160	Wow, Andy.
3523160	3525160	I'm Don Knotts.
3525160	3527160	I'm Bill Clinton.
3527160	3529160	I'm Don Knotts.
3529160	3531160	I'm Bill Clinton.
3532160	3535160	And then there's a third one that fits that same category.
3535160	3536160	Who is it?
3536160	3537160	Who is it?
3537160	3538160	Who is it?
3538160	3539160	Who's the third?
3539160	3540160	Is it Jimmy Stewart?
3540160	3543160	Well, Jimmy Stewart's more the, oh, oh, oh.
3543160	3544160	Oh, Jimmy Stewart.
3544160	3545160	I'm Don Knotts!
3545160	3547160	I'm Bill Clinton.
3547160	3551160	But when he raised, when Jimmy Stewart raises his voice, he does the weird octave thing,
3551160	3553160	like in, I was watching him.
3553160	3555160	What's the Christmas picture where?
3555160	3556160	It's a wonderful life.
3556160	3557160	Yes.
3557160	3560160	And not as good as I remembered it, frankly.
3560160	3562160	A little more, not a torpid.
3562160	3564160	I still haven't seen it all the way through.
3564160	3565160	It's sweaty.
3565160	3566160	It's a sweaty fucking Christmas movie.
3566160	3569160	Everybody would rather live in Bedford Falls because it's way more fun.
3569160	3574160	Well, Bedford Falls has bars that are open all night and like places to dance and shit.
3574160	3576160	Yeah, and people talk jive and stuff like that.
3576160	3577160	Yeah, right.
3577160	3578160	In the regular Bedford Falls, everyone, yeah.
3578160	3581160	No, but in that one he's like, well, it comes up pretty handy on her, Bob!
3581160	3584160	Like he'll lose his shit and it goes right to the top.
3584160	3585160	Did I tell you?
3585160	3586160	You weren't there, Greg.
3586160	3587160	I was with Drew.
3587160	3589160	Did you get knocked over by Jimmy Stewart at a bar here in L.A.?
3589160	3590160	No.
3590160	3591160	No.
3591160	3592160	So I'm there.
3592160	3593160	No, listen.
3593160	3596160	I'm there with Katherine Hepburn, okay?
3596160	3599160	Ginger Rogers was on the dance floor.
3599160	3603160	Jimmy Stewart comes out of the elevator and I don't know what the fuck Jimmy Stewart's on.
3603160	3604160	Oh.
3604160	3606160	I'm fucked to the tits.
3606160	3608160	I'm ripped.
3608160	3613160	Who's that piece of ass over there?
3613160	3621160	I was at, I was, remember when Drew Carey and I were dating?
3621160	3622160	Oh, yeah, absolutely.
3622160	3623160	Drew was single for a while.
3623160	3625160	He would call me up and say, let's go to Vegas.
3625160	3626160	We would go to Vegas.
3626160	3631160	And we went to go see John Fogarty from CCR, of course, and he played at the Hard Rock
3631160	3634160	at the, what was then, the old joint.
3634160	3636160	And he had front row center seats too.
3636160	3639160	And Drew's gambling out in the high stakes blackjack joint, you know, of course winning
3639160	3641160	because he's rich and he can't lose.
3641160	3642160	Right.
3642160	3647160	And Gary Busey is there and he's with a very lovely gal and I don't know that it's a prostitute.
3647160	3650160	I just have my feelings about that.
3650160	3653160	She's my sponsor.
3653160	3657160	So we meet a bit, and so Drew's like, hey man, the show's starting.
3657160	3659160	So like, I got to finish out this hand.
3659160	3660160	I'm doing really well.
3660160	3662160	So if you want to go, like there's an opening banner right now.
3662160	3665160	By the way, this is a dead accurate Drew Carey.
3665160	3666160	Jeff does the best Drew Carey.
3666160	3667160	I can't do him as well.
3667160	3668160	I'll be there in a bit.
3668160	3669160	So we get there.
3669160	3670160	I don't know.
3670160	3671160	Don't dance real funny.
3671160	3672160	I don't know what the seats are.
3672160	3673160	So I walk into the thing and it's because it's John Fogarty, it's not people standing
3673160	3674160	up.
3674160	3675160	It's chairs.
3675160	3676160	Yeah.
3676160	3677160	It's silver ponytails.
3677160	3678160	Yeah, exactly.
3678160	3679160	Lots of silver ponytails.
3679160	3684160	And so I look for the thing and of course it's because it's Drew, it is the dead center
3684160	3685160	seat.
3685160	3686160	There are 15 seats.
3686160	3687160	Right.
3687160	3688160	Muhammad Ali's in the corner.
3688160	3689160	Yeah.
3689160	3690160	Exactly.
3691160	3692160	So I'm by myself.
3692160	3696160	And so I just sit down and there's eight seats flanking me empty.
3696160	3698160	So I looked like the weirdest guy in the world.
3698160	3701160	I think, oh wow, this guy bought 12 seats for himself.
3701160	3704160	So I'm sitting there and finally Drew comes and our friends all show up.
3704160	3711160	And I think you're a homicide detective who never solved the case of the guy who kept
3711160	3714160	murdering women and playing a John Fogarty character.
3714160	3720160	When he plays Born on the Bayou, I'm going to scan this crowd pretty fucking hard tonight.
3720160	3723160	Such a song that they did.
3723160	3725160	So fucking John Fogarty sounds amazing.
3725160	3728160	He still sounds like it's 40 years ago.
3728160	3729160	He's brilliant.
3729160	3730160	And he's laying it down.
3730160	3733160	And then Drew comes and all of our friends are there.
3733160	3734160	And I'm like, thank you for coming.
3734160	3735160	That was very strange.
3735160	3740160	But it was kind of fun to be like the weirdest, like the weirdest guy in the world.
3740160	3741160	And I'm like, thank you for coming.
3741160	3742160	That was very strange.
3742160	3747160	But it was kind of fun to be like the weirdest, like high roller guy that didn't buy the tickets.
3747160	3748160	Drew carried it.
3748160	3751160	Then I keep getting flicked in the back of the head and it's bussy.
3751160	3754160	He's row three.
3754160	3757160	And everyone is seated because it's people watching his show.
3757160	3760160	And it's not like, you know, Nine Inch Nails is not on stage.
3760160	3763160	He's like, put me in, coach.
3763160	3766160	No one's going to be standing up for that.
3767160	3769160	He keeps flicking me and Drew in the back of the head.
3769160	3770160	Hey, guys!
3770160	3771160	Who?
3771160	3772160	Who?
3772160	3773160	Who?
3773160	3774160	Who?
3774160	3777160	It's like painful flicks in the back of the head like you're in junior high school.
3777160	3781160	And we're like, Gary Busey keeps flicking me in the head.
3781160	3782160	And he's standing up.
3782160	3783160	Yeah!
3783160	3784160	Yeah!
3784160	3785160	The whole show.
3785160	3788160	And at one point Fogerty looks at him and goes, Gary, I see you.
3788160	3789160	Sit down.
3789160	3790160	Did he go?
3793160	3794160	Wow.
3797160	3799160	So imagine how many shows he's been to.
3799160	3801160	And John Fogerty's like, really?
3801160	3802160	John Fogerty's like, come on, man.
3802160	3804160	Like, people are trying to enjoy this shit.
3804160	3809160	So imagine having success at that level where Gary Busey is your Adam Goldberg.
3817160	3821160	You have the regular crazy guy that comes to the show that sometimes you've got to go,
3821160	3822160	hey, take it easy.
3822160	3824160	And it's Gary Busey.
3825160	3826160	That's fantastic.
3826160	3830160	You know, Gary Busey was in Leon Russell's band.
3830160	3831160	He was the drummer for years.
3831160	3832160	And his name was Teddy Jack Eddie.
3832160	3834160	He went by Teddy Jack Eddie.
3834160	3837160	And when he did Buddy Holly, he played and sang all the fucking songs in the movie with
3837160	3838160	that band.
3838160	3846160	Gary Busey is like a, you know, not only is he, you know, amazingly incandescently weird,
3846160	3851160	to put it gently, he actually has a rock and roll background, which makes it even more
3851160	3852160	frightening.
3852160	3854160	Well, OK, that's a perfect segue.
3854160	3856160	Let's bring out Spencer, first of all.
3858160	3859160	Spencer Crittenden.
3861160	3864160	To the Spence, to the Sur, to the Spence Spence Sur.
3866160	3867160	Hey, baby.
3872160	3873160	We're the Kings of Rock.
3873160	3875160	We'll take you higher.
3875160	3876160	Doesn't that really remind you?
3876160	3879160	Sucker MCs must call me Sire.
3879160	3884160	So I wanted to address Randy Quaid a little bit.
3884160	3885160	Yeah.
3885160	3888160	You're the only one I know that I actually went through this video with.
3888160	3889160	Oh, boy.
3890160	3893160	I was at my friend's house the other day.
3893160	3896160	And I was like, has anyone seen that Randy Quaid video?
3896160	3898160	And they didn't understand.
3898160	3901160	And so I was like, no, you have to see this.
3901160	3904160	And then no one put it on immediately.
3904160	3906160	So I was like, no, you have to see this.
3906160	3909160	And every 15 minutes, I was like, seriously, you fucking guys,
3909160	3911160	you have to watch this video.
3911160	3914160	It's the most important thing in the world right now.
3914160	3917160	I am aware of it because I saw it on the web today, but I didn't watch it.
3917160	3921160	I did hover watch a Dennis Quaid video where he was quite calm.
3922160	3926160	That's what I keep thinking about is Dennis Quaid just waking up in the morning.
3926160	3929160	Like the morning I get up because there's a call time.
3929160	3930160	It's like 6 30 a.m.
3930160	3933160	Shrob text me, Randy Quaid.
3933160	3937160	He sent me a link to the YouTube video and said he does.
3937160	3940160	He quotes Independence Day at the end of the video.
3940160	3943160	Watch the whole thing because he goes, I'm back.
3943160	3948160	Well, he's a thing, which is a thing for the thing.
3948160	3949160	It sent me down this rabbit hole.
3949160	3951160	I'm like, what happened with Randy Quaid?
3951160	3955160	Because he everyone just keeps brushing it into this pile and very,
3955160	3960160	very phobic about dismissing crazy behavior.
3960160	3963160	I don't I guess it's obvious reasons.
3963160	3965160	Like I don't want to be like, you know,
3965160	3971160	a couple moves from that on that chessboard from if we're going to start
3971160	3972160	depending on where we draw the line.
3972160	3973160	I don't know how you play chess.
3974160	3978160	They look to Harmon for me in two.
3978160	3982160	So like I always whenever whenever whenever somebody like has a meltdown
3982160	3985160	in the press or like, oh, that crazy person, that crazy person,
3985160	3988160	whether it's the Coney 2012 guy or Charlie Sheen or Randy Quaid or me,
3989160	3993160	sometimes whatever they I always like go like, well,
3993160	3994160	what's the real story here?
3994160	3995160	What's going on?
3995160	3999160	Because the last thing I want to do is be a part of stuff of a of a gang of
3999160	4000160	any kind.
4001160	4006160	If it's easy to say what a nut bar I always I always I'm always compelled to
4006160	4007160	let go. What does he do in this video?
4007160	4008160	Oh, God.
4008160	4011160	Well, you don't even you don't even you don't even know the headline of it.
4011160	4014160	You know, I just saw that he made this and the wife's there, too, I presume.
4014160	4016160	Yeah, the wife is there and she's in a bikini top.
4016160	4020160	She's hanging out in the background and then it's worse.
4020160	4024160	She's kind of glaring at the camera through aviator shades while he explains
4024160	4028160	as he has before that Rupert Murdoch has it in for him and that he has never been
4028160	4032160	that he's been fucked over by this like kind of larger system,
4032160	4036160	which we can talk about in a second exactly what his what his theory is
4036160	4037160	and why he has it.
4037160	4042160	But he has this this this, you know, he feels he's been persecuted.
4042160	4045160	I went down the rabbit hole of going through the timeline of everything that's
4045160	4049160	happened to him started in 2007 cut to I don't have time to explain all of it,
4049160	4053160	but cut to he's got no U.S. passport and he's basically sitting in one room in
4053160	4058160	Canada waiting to get either, I guess, put in jail in Canada or sent.
4058160	4060160	I don't know where he doesn't have a U.S. passport.
4060160	4062160	They took Hillary Clinton took his passport away.
4062160	4063160	I don't think personally.
4063160	4065160	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
4065160	4066160	He says he says Hillary Clinton.
4066160	4073160	That's pretty specific, man, because, you know, John Kerry called me the other week
4073160	4077160	and he wanted to take my passport away, but I don't give it to him.
4077160	4078160	Exactly. It's a trick.
4078160	4081160	I don't want to end up in Ontario in a fucking room with my wife.
4081160	4084160	So he's never worn a bikini top in a video that I can remember.
4084160	4090160	So he does he does a small rant, says like, I hi, I'm Randy Quaid.
4090160	4097160	I made 20th century Fox a billion dollars when I saved the world in Independence Day.
4097160	4100160	Rupert Murdoch is in return.
4100160	4101160	What's happened?
4101160	4102160	And he just kind of recounts.
4102160	4108160	He gets mad that Rupert Murdoch didn't thank him for saving the world in Independence Day at some point.
4108160	4111160	Yeah, I mean, he kind of that's you're worried about calling him a nut bar.
4111160	4113160	Yeah, I am.
4113160	4114160	I understand.
4114160	4116160	What I'm worried about is not fun to pile on.
4116160	4121160	I'm worried about calling him a drug addict because I think that everyone keeps going like, oh,
4121160	4124160	crystal meth, crystal meth, crystal meth.
4124160	4130160	Let he who is without drugs cast the first, you know, only users only users lose drugs.
4131160	4136160	Let's all I feel like when I have a nervous breakdown, you will part is that going to happen tonight.
4136160	4137160	It may have happened Wednesday.
4137160	4138160	You don't know.
4138160	4142160	But part and parcel of my breakdown will be an increased use of whatever substances make.
4142160	4143160	No question.
4143160	4144160	No question.
4144160	4146160	And so I always wonder when people for me, it's Tang.
4146160	4151160	I have these like they have these brush ups with the press and the contemporary society.
4151160	4153160	And it's like, oh, the drugs and the lab.
4153160	4154160	And it's so immediate.
4154160	4159160	And I'm like, is the drug the causal agent because he's not everyone says he's the sweetest guy in the world.
4159160	4160160	Yeah.
4160160	4163160	He's been married to his wife, Evie, for since the 90s.
4163160	4164160	They've always had a very.
4164160	4165160	It's not a terrible actor.
4165160	4166160	He's quite a good actor.
4166160	4169160	Fabulously talented and the great character actor.
4169160	4176160	And they and his marriage to you can't you can't Yoko the to to to put it on.
4176160	4179160	She's not she's not the cause of any problems either.
4179160	4183160	Like they've had a they've had a passionate partnership since the 90s.
4183160	4187160	She didn't come in and start causing problems in his life.
4187160	4191160	In 2007, shit just switched to like a light.
4191160	4193160	Like stuff started going weird.
4193160	4199160	Now, you usually when you lose your mind statistically, you're in your your your early 20s.
4199160	4200160	Some some people could.
4200160	4207160	But but if you're in a marriage and it's a it's a biochemical thing, you don't go crazy together.
4207160	4208160	That's and there.
4208160	4209160	And he is not messed out.
4209160	4210160	He is not.
4210160	4211160	He's not.
4211160	4212160	He does not.
4212160	4215160	He's chubby and and ruddy faced and healthy looking.
4215160	4221160	He just seems to be really put out by what he claims is a is a global conspiracy.
4221160	4225160	He's having a manic episode or something that it was been lasting for like six years.
4225160	4227160	Yeah, but sometimes they do.
4227160	4231160	You know, that's what I that's that's what I look at Sinatra in the 50s or whatever.
4231160	4233160	You know, like he made five million records or whatever.
4233160	4235160	And, you know, I think he was up all night every night.
4235160	4239160	She's like, well, that's the biggest crime of all that is if Sinatra was as if we're missing.
4239160	4241160	As if we're missing Randy Quaids.
4249160	4254160	I would hate to think that we're missing Randy Quaids best years then because well, I don't think we're missing.
4254160	4258160	I it's horrible when people pile on, though, and it turns into chasing Frankenstein to the village.
4258160	4260160	I don't know when the crime is being weird.
4260160	4262160	It's like it's like, well, you're right.
4262160	4264160	I think it's great when people gang up.
4264160	4267160	I think the great thing about the Internet is that we can gang up on bullies.
4267160	4268160	I think that's fucking great.
4268160	4269160	Yeah, that's the best part.
4269160	4275160	The weird thing is that we we just it is that we seem to keep ganging up on nerds like we just like Brian Williamson.
4275160	4276160	Shut up.
4276160	4277160	Like, really, dude.
4277160	4281160	But what Hollywood throw their arms around him like they did Robert Downey and like, like, I hope so.
4281160	4282160	Let's make you famous again.
4282160	4283160	Or what's his name?
4283160	4286160	The wrestler, Mickey Rourke.
4286160	4287160	Yeah, I hope so.
4287160	4290160	I mean, he's he's he's he's aging really gracefully.
4290160	4291160	He's a wonderful performer.
4291160	4292160	He's got this powerful voice.
4292160	4294160	He's clearly off his rocker.
4294160	4300160	But I don't even I don't even want to use that phrase necessarily because it's like, like, like, I don't know.
4300160	4301160	Like, like he's an actor.
4301160	4303160	How sane is he supposed to be?
4303160	4305160	And exactly what the fuck happened?
4305160	4306160	I don't know.
4306160	4307160	I don't know.
4307160	4308160	That's it.
4308160	4312160	I feel like TMZ got him arrested six times is what happened to him.
4312160	4315160	That's enough to make anyone, you know, a little upset.
4315160	4316160	He's freaky.
4316160	4318160	There's no question about Spencer.
4318160	4323160	You know, my argument always is like Dick Cheney walks the streets free every day and feels fucking empowered to give us a pay.
4323160	4325160	Empowered to give his opinion any time he likes.
4325160	4328160	Donald Trump fucking comes on TV and tells us he's going to run for president.
4328160	4330160	Sarah Palin gives speeches and shit like that.
4330160	4333160	And no one impunes their sanity at any point.
4333160	4341160	And yet they're all evil, fucking insane, unbelievable, unbalanced maniacs destroyed the world in their own fine way.
4341160	4350160	If you took their money away by by by signing some form at City Hall that said that their jurisprudence wasn't the hall of bursars in the flim flim flam.
4350160	4354160	Like nothing looks crazier than being poor and having an opinion.
4354160	4362160	Donald Trump, if he was fucking like, he shuffled in here right now and had like a rat tail on his cheek and said the shit that he says on Twitter.
4362160	4364160	You'd be like from America.
4364160	4366160	Are you out of your goddamn mind?
4366160	4368160	I mean, and even just his right.
4368160	4370160	You got a market set on your head.
4370160	4371160	Yeah.
4371160	4374160	Like just being born rich just gives you like this sanity pass.
4374160	4375160	Oh, it doesn't adjust.
4375160	4378160	So what I'm curious about is how they lost their money.
4378160	4388160	And that's the I don't say that because all the trouble started like Hillary Clinton took away the passport and all of his gold.
4388160	4391160	Well, they're sitting up there in Canada and they're making videos.
4391160	4394160	You can you can follow Evie Evie Evie Quaid on Twitter.
4394160	4396160	She has like one hundred and forty eight followers.
4396160	4399160	And I saw like one hundred and forty eight.
4399160	4401160	Yeah. They have like they have like these videos.
4401160	4404160	There's like other videos that they're making from the same room.
4404160	4407160	How could you only have that many of this is that big of a thing?
4407160	4408160	Yeah.
4408160	4409160	That's what I don't understand.
4409160	4410160	I don't know.
4410160	4411160	Why doesn't she have.
4411160	4412160	Yeah.
4412160	4413160	I don't.
4413160	4414160	I don't.
4414160	4415160	I don't.
4415160	4416160	It's one of those weird.
4416160	4418160	That's why I'm fascinated with their story because it's kind of doesn't doesn't doesn't
4418160	4423160	doesn't fall into every little apple box on my understanding of the world factory.
4423160	4431160	But then you work in a bungalow where there's a proprietary exponential booking.
4431160	4433160	You know, what did you call it?
4433160	4434160	Recycled recycling bins.
4434160	4435160	There's there's.
4435160	4437160	For a fact that those are hypocritical recycling.
4437160	4439160	Well, there I know because there is no actual.
4439160	4443160	There's not a box that says it just put shit and turds and boogers in here.
4443160	4445160	There are dead raccoons.
4445160	4448160	There's there's like there are a lot of dead raccoons in the bungalow.
4448160	4451160	There's there's got to be one underneath it.
4451160	4459160	No, that was my last script.
4459160	4463160	There's nothing like a small mammal joke to really rock.
4463160	4467160	The foxes must have got to it.
4467160	4471160	That's why act three was so unsatisfying.
4471160	4476160	I think a ferret got to that.
4476160	4477160	There's a yeah.
4477160	4480160	There's just four giant boxes and there's a guy that comes at midnight and I sleep at
4480160	4485160	my office enough to know that all he does is show up to like like sometimes he doesn't
4485160	4486160	know I'm there.
4486160	4489160	So I get to listen to what he does from midnight to four thirty a.m.
4489160	4494160	And it's a real like risky business situation out there like he's boom boom boom boom boom
4494160	4495160	boom boom.
4495160	4500160	He just put those old records on the shelf except he just keeps emptying the same garbage
4500160	4502160	over and over again.
4502160	4506160	And I keep thinking he's going to come in my office and he has a key if he wants to he
4506160	4507160	can.
4507160	4508160	But so I just sit there with my blanket.
4508160	4514160	Like it's like it's like the the Baba Duke or whatever.
4514160	4516160	And I just hear him out there just emptying stuff.
4516160	4520160	And then if I clear my throat he'll like be gone in 10 minutes because I think he just
4520160	4522160	comes to my bungalow to fuck around.
4522160	4524160	But he also maybe thinks that someone's watching him.
4524160	4528160	So he pretends to take out the garbage for four hours.
4528160	4529160	All right.
4529160	4531160	So anyways is is my better half here.
4531160	4534160	Yeah we should get we should get scooting on the Shadowrun as soon as we can.
4534160	4535160	Yeah.
4535160	4537160	Is Aaron McGathey in the house.
4537160	4538160	Aaron McGathey.
4538160	4559160	Let's run some shadows.
4559160	4562160	Johnny Ramone's funeral will commence in five minutes.
4562160	4563160	Wow.
4563160	4568160	I may have ruined one of your keyboards.
4568160	4573160	What in the max headroom is going on.
4573160	4576160	Aaron's in a very good costume.
4576160	4577160	Can we dress up for our things.
4577160	4578160	Maybe I'll come.
4578160	4586160	That's like that's like when Max asked if he could rap.
4586160	4589160	Yeah I can't ask you to dress up but please go ahead.
4589160	4591160	I'm a 20 year old elf female shaman.
4591160	4594160	I mean I'll do it.
4594160	4598160	His hands are tied folks.
4598160	4600160	I forgot it at home but I made you an earring.
4600160	4601160	You did?
4601160	4602160	A clip on earring.
4602160	4603160	Yeah a single earring.
4603160	4604160	I love it.
4604160	4610160	Yeah I was late because I have to finish a cake that I'm making for a film.
4610160	4611160	That's sad now that I did that.
4611160	4616160	Is it cake boss the movie?
4616160	4620160	It's hamburger four this time it's a bakery.
4620160	4627160	And I realized that my actual cake wasn't cool so I made this outfit.
4627160	4629160	Oh you don't like your cake?
4629160	4631160	You think your cake's bad?
4631160	4635160	No no the cake is fine it just has to cool for me to properly decorate it.
4635160	4637160	Oh I thought you said it wasn't cool.
4637160	4641160	Oh no and then I just lost my mind and I'm like where's the glue gun.
4641160	4643160	I'm dressing up.
4643160	4644160	This isn't enough.
4644160	4647160	I blew it on the cake.
4647160	4649160	Do we have to mortgage here as well?
4649160	4650160	Yes.
4650160	4651160	Let's bring up Demours.
4651160	4652160	Demours Brown.
4652160	4653160	Hey Demours.
4653160	4654160	Or Bill as I know you.
4654160	4655160	Sorry.
4655160	4656160	I love you so I always will.
4656160	4657160	I'm just a Bill.
4657160	4670160	The way people say oh when I kiss my wife which is a totally normal thing for every human
4670160	4672160	makes me feel very inhuman.
4672160	4673160	Doesn't it?
4673160	4677160	I talk about my wife a lot on my show and people go I can't believe how proud you are of your
4677160	4678160	wife.
4678160	4684160	You keep her in a room like fucking Jane Eyre or something?
4684160	4689160	I took an Uber over here and the Uber driver and I watched the feed on the way over so
4689160	4691160	it was so strange coming into the room.
4691160	4693160	Oh good plug sweetie.
4693160	4701160	Yeah well it was great I was whisked away and anyway I was watching the feed and an
4701160	4705160	Uber driver turned back behind he said you're from that house there's another man I take
4705160	4707160	him to Burbank and I'm like yes yes yes.
4707160	4712160	Oh you had our talk?
4712160	4715160	Not Stebnorts?
4715160	4717160	Or did you have one of the 37 Armons?
4717160	4725160	This is Armon and he said he's an assistant to a cook and I just stopped the feed I was
4725160	4726160	like what?
4726160	4729160	He's not an assistant to a cook he said I take him to Burbank and there's a big picture
4729160	4730160	there.
4730160	4734160	A big cooking picture and he's an assistant to a cook and I said no no he's a writer and
4734160	4736160	he said for a cook?
4736160	4738160	Are you a writer for a cook?
4738160	4741160	What do you write like take the spatula flip the pancake?
4741160	4745160	I'm a polygamist and this is how we find out.
4745160	4749160	I wasn't watching the feed tonight I was watching I don't know if you saw but Jonathan E. from
4749160	4754160	the Houston team is playing a worldwide rollerball match tonight so I was watching that on the
4754160	4755160	way over.
4755160	4757160	Yes that's a rollerball reference everybody wow.
4757160	4759160	The logo for my animation.
4759160	4760160	That was for me.
4760160	4764160	Jonathan the logo for Starburns is a cook is a chef that's what he's talking about it's
4764160	4768160	kind of amazing that I don't know I'm like oh that's adorable.
4768160	4772160	He thinks you teach a cooking school at a cooking school.
4772160	4779160	It's like when Harvey barks at Danny DeVito I'm like wow he thinks it's a dog.
4779160	4783160	Just top down.
4783160	4786160	Uh oh dossiers.
4786160	4792160	My dog thinks that Danny DeVito or we don't know we can never know why our dog barks at
4792160	4793160	Danny DeVito.
4793160	4800160	If you if you if when the eye if you put on a latter season of always sunny the dog
4800160	4803160	goes nuts like there's a cat on the screen or something.
4803160	4807160	If you that's for you.
4807160	4816160	If it's in my mind the dog will also in the iTunes screen if if if the if the rainmaker
4816160	4821160	with Danny DeVito and Matt Damon both of whom are on the poster is in the upper left corner
4821160	4827160	of the screen because it's in your most recently viewed section the Harvey will look up at
4827160	4832160	the upper left corner of the screen and go.
4832160	4838160	Because it's smaller Danny DeVito and more well groomed but then you put in season six
4838160	4843160	of always sunny and he goes.
4843160	4849160	And and and only does that for dogs cats and Danny DeVito.
4849160	4855160	Possibly because they're all the same weight but if you put in like like like Junior or something like that like like like
4855160	4861160	it has to be like a disheveled Danny DeVito like he has to get furry.
4861160	4864160	I mean wore the roses is outer.
4864160	4870160	Well I don't know we haven't put it where he tried like like one floor over the cuckoo's nest when he's quite young.
4870160	4871160	I haven't tried it.
4871160	4873160	I mean haven't gone through the whole routine.
4873160	4877160	I'm just amazed the fucking dog like it barks at the drawings of cats.
4877160	4882160	And I said I said I said to Aaron like try drawing a picture of a dog on a piece of paper with a Sharpie.
4882160	4888160	Let's see if this fucking dog is like goddamn Caesar implanted of the dogs.
4888160	4893160	And and so Aaron goes like oh yeah good idea and she drives this thing.
4893160	4896160	Aaron's an artist I guess she does it like that.
4896160	4903160	She drives a cartoon dog the dog's head is the size of the dog's body like she's drawing like like a pictogram of a dog like like that.
4903160	4906160	I'm like no I'm so sorry.
4906160	4910160	Try to draw like a regular picture of a dog baked a dog.
4910160	4914160	I wonder what it's like being married to Greg Proops.
4914160	4918160	She drew the most amazing drawing of a dog is what Greg would say.
4918160	4919160	My wife's a very good artist.
4919160	4921160	She did the pictures for my book.
4921160	4924160	So then I go sit.
4924160	4925160	Good plug sweetie.
4925160	4926160	She did actually.
4926160	4932160	So I go draw a regular picture like draw just like a silhouette of a dog just draw like a like a kind of a realistic shape of a dog.
4932160	4933160	And she goes OK OK.
4933160	4934160	I think I got you.
4934160	4935160	I got you.
4935160	4936160	Yeah yeah yeah.
4936160	4937160	OK.
4937160	4950160	And she draws for a while and then she turns it around and it's a picture of me with a dick in my mouth.
4950160	4954160	Max you can buy that drawing if you want later on after the show.
4954160	4956160	Is it a picture or a photograph.
4956160	4959160	It was inspired by very real things in her head.
4959160	4964160	Spencer let's let's let's get this rolling horn from the pages of reality.
4964160	4968160	Now Greg are you are you hip Greg to what's going on in our shadow.
4968160	4969160	I'm so hip to the jive.
4969160	4974160	Dan and I had an extensive conversation where let's move on.
4974160	4975160	All right.
4975160	4976160	Spencer do you want to.
4976160	4977160	What do you need from us.
4977160	4978160	Do you want to get you want to get rolling here.
4978160	4979160	Do you want any preamble.
4979160	4981160	Do you have a groovy theme song and shit.
4981160	4982160	I don't know.
4982160	4983160	I do have music for us.
4983160	4985160	Well there you go.
4985160	4986160	I don't.
4986160	4990160	I didn't write anything down for the intro part so I don't know.
4990160	4991160	Maybe just I can do it.
4991160	4992160	All right.
4992160	4997160	Well put up the music and Dan'll do it then.
4997160	5000160	Last time on Shadow Run.
5000160	5003160	This is a damn jamba juice.
5003160	5006160	Get your ass out here.
5006160	5014160	We don't got no hamburger.
5014160	5022160	Go down to pinks.
5022160	5032040	Jim Nightblade and his Shadow Run crew were assigned to find a BTL chip designer named
5032040	5044120	Baldwin Brown in a compound surrounded by BTL aka better than life chips that they were
5044120	5050800	also supposed to get a hold of infiltrating the compound with his fingertip nano whip.
5050800	5057960	Jim Nightblade made quick work of the perimeter scaling the roof of the nearest warehouse again
5057960	5060680	nano whipping a nearby vent.
5060680	5073120	The other characters did fine sliding down silently like a deadly spider.
5073120	5079480	Jim Nightblade came down in the middle of the warehouse with his grappling gun and his
5079480	5094560	faithful sexually tense compatriot Eve Liberty Eve Liberty helping her down onto the floor.
5094560	5100520	Nightblade then asked her to send a stone bolt to the two guys playing poker and then they
5100520	5104720	got they didn't it didn't work all the way and they shot some people.
5104720	5111680	Hordegard the German guy is keeping watch from beyond using his psychic powers Eve Liberty
5111680	5113320	meanwhile is out front.
5113320	5114320	That's Mercy.
5114320	5115320	Mercy.
5115320	5116320	Sorry.
5116320	5117320	Mercy.
5117320	5118320	God damn it.
5118320	5119320	Mercy O'Donnell.
5119320	5120320	Mercy.
5120320	5125880	That's my wife's character is out at the south gate occupying three armed guards with
5125880	5134480	various Dirk Benedict a circa 18 shenanigans.
5134480	5141160	When we left them Nightblade and Eve were closing the distance between themselves and
5141160	5147040	the backs of the meaty heads of the three security guards that we were about to shoot
5147040	5148040	him.
5148040	5149040	Okay.
5149040	5150040	Yeah.
5150040	5159320	You know what's amazing is that you did that in 46 seconds which is almost exactly what
5159320	5161360	the old length of Spencer's intro was.
5161360	5162360	You felt that.
5162360	5166360	I thought you were gonna say I thought you were gonna look at that and then go 46 minutes.
5166360	5172600	The show was over fire usually the master of brevity but you really wrapped that fucker
5172600	5173600	up.
5174600	5175600	Yeah.
5175600	5180560	Perhaps it was because he was missing some certain information about Hordegard and what
5180560	5181560	he did.
5181560	5184360	Maybe we should hear the intro from Hordegard's perspective.
5184360	5186440	Is this like our Rashomon?
5186440	5190280	Perhaps not the whole intro but for example I am not German.
5190280	5193360	I'm Norwegian.
5193360	5195800	Same difference during the war bro.
5195800	5196800	Nice.
5196800	5197800	Wow.
5197800	5198800	Too soon.
5198800	5199800	Warburn.
5199800	5200800	Apparently.
5201800	5202800	What a chop.
5202800	5203800	Well.
5203800	5204800	Alright.
5204800	5214480	So just some housekeeping up top it's actually a mono whip not a nano whip.
5214480	5221000	It's actually quite a bit thicker than a nano whip.
5221000	5227000	We're talking about dicks right?
5228000	5229000	Okay.
5229000	5245000	It's actually quite a bit thicker than a nano whip it just looked at Greg and Greg went.
5245000	5248000	I think it was either did I leave the oven on or.
5248000	5253000	Alright so the three guards are being occupied by Mercy right now right Spencer?
5253000	5254000	Yeah.
5255000	5260000	And Hordegard you got a line of fire on those guards too right?
5260000	5261000	From the front side that's correct.
5261000	5265000	From the front outside the gate of the warehouse compound.
5265000	5269000	Jim Nightblade and I Eve were sneaking up from behind right now correct?
5269000	5271000	Well you were on the roof of the building.
5271000	5273000	Okay well I descend down to get with Jim Nightblade.
5273000	5275000	Alright that happens.
5275000	5280000	Hey Nightblade I got your back.
5280000	5283000	Sorry I'm getting air in a drink.
5284000	5288000	What's the range between Jim Nightblade and I with the guards?
5288000	5291000	Well he's still on the roof you're about 120 feet off.
5291000	5293000	Oh he's not down there yet?
5293000	5294000	I didn't hear him go down there.
5294000	5296000	Nightblade get down here.
5296000	5299000	I'm down there.
5301000	5304000	What's your agility plus sneaking Dan?
5304000	5306000	Fuck.
5306000	5308000	I'm so sorry.
5308000	5313000	Probably four plus something in parentheses.
5316000	5318000	I think it was nine total last time right?
5318000	5321000	Well that was me shooting dudes I remember that.
5321000	5324000	Agility plus sneaking I had a tougher time with.
5324000	5328000	Five plus looking at my sneaking.
5328000	5330000	Four plus four.
5330000	5333000	That's 13 then yeah?
5333000	5338000	Alright you sneak down quietly.
5338000	5340000	And how far away from these guards?
5340000	5341000	120 feet.
5341000	5344000	Alright Mercy keep them looking at you.
5344000	5345000	We're sneaking up behind them.
5345000	5347000	We're going to get a shot on these guys.
5347000	5351000	Alright can you see through my head?
5351000	5353000	No.
5353000	5356000	That was me in character as Mercy.
5356000	5360000	I don't think they would say it like that thank you.
5360000	5362000	Alright let me try that again.
5362000	5368000	I look at them and I'm acting kind of crazy to distract them.
5368000	5373000	Hey sometimes I feel like no one can see me at all and it feels like you guys can really see me.
5373000	5375000	Can you see me or see through me?
5375000	5376000	No.
5376000	5379000	I use my fucking diplomacy.
5379000	5380000	Is that just gone?
5380000	5383000	Do I no longer have any charisma?
5383000	5385000	What?
5385000	5386000	Do I have charisma?
5386000	5390000	You're asking them a question they're answering I don't I don't get what's happening.
5390000	5393000	Okay sorry Spencer the way you said it.
5393000	5395000	It's a question you're asking right?
5395000	5398000	Well it's a flirtatious.
5398000	5403000	Why are you flirting with Spencer?
5403000	5406000	Alright well they're still looking at me even though they said no right?
5406000	5407000	Yeah.
5407000	5408000	Okay.
5408000	5411000	They can't see through your head.
5411000	5419000	Alright I'm going I'm going to regroup and approach differently from now on.
5419000	5420000	So they're going to look at me.
5420000	5421000	I'm not going to walk away.
5421000	5425000	Jim Nightblade I'm going to cast improved invisibility on myself.
5425000	5430000	I become invisible to human beings and to sensors and cameras and things like that.
5430000	5435000	Walk up and just I have shot gloves where my gloves are electric and I'm just going to go zap and knock these guys out.
5435000	5438000	But you got to well no there's only two guys there's three of them right?
5438000	5439000	Three.
5439000	5441000	I've got the third one covered.
5441000	5444000	Okay do you like this plan or do you want to come with?
5444000	5454000	Yeah I'm going to go from my left so the third one will be all the way on my right.
5454000	5459000	Or I could just cast a stun ball on all these guys and just knock them all out.
5459000	5469000	Yeah the more stunned they are when I get within shooting range the more alive they'll be tomorrow for their families.
5469000	5484000	This is Aaron asking when we ended last time I had said to that group that they should stay and I was going to walk away and we ended on a cliffhanger.
5484000	5485000	Am I still standing there?
5485000	5487000	I felt like we were about to pull the triggers and shoot these guys.
5487000	5488000	Let's just shoot these fuckers.
5488000	5489000	Let's just take them out.
5489000	5492000	Yeah I have walked away but they are standing.
5492000	5496000	I totally vote for shooting if that's what we're doing.
5496000	5508000	All right I've got my stick and shock bullets in my gun and I put it on like three shot pulse mode.
5508000	5510000	So how far away are you?
5510000	5512000	We start closing the gap maybe?
5512000	5514000	You want to sneak up a bit?
5514000	5517000	Yeah I'm walking toward these guys until I can shoot them in the head.
5517000	5519000	Okay we're walking toward them.
5519000	5522000	What's a good range to shoot that from?
5522000	5523000	On your pistols?
5523000	5524000	Yeah.
5524000	5526000	Probably about 20 meters.
5526000	5528000	Okay we close that distance.
5528000	5531000	You do that quietly.
5531000	5532000	All is well.
5532000	5533000	Okay.
5533000	5534000	Guys let's just.
5534000	5536000	I'm there with a rifle.
5536000	5539000	I have it aimed 200 armor piercing rounds.
5539000	5541000	I'm using four of those.
5541000	5542000	Okay.
5542000	5543000	And I'm waiting for the third one.
5543000	5544000	Hordegard pick a guy.
5544000	5545000	What's your guy look like?
5545000	5546000	The one you're still standing.
5546000	5547000	That's the one I'm going to shoot.
5547000	5548000	You're going to get him.
5548000	5549000	You will shoot first.
5549000	5550000	One will still be standing.
5550000	5551000	That's the one I'm going to take out.
5551000	5552000	Right.
5552000	5553000	Okay.
5553000	5554000	Okay so.
5554000	5556000	And I'm 100 yards away from the guys at this point.
5556000	5557000	I can show you.
5557000	5558000	Okay.
5558000	5559000	I will not shoot.
5559000	5560000	Jim which one do you want?
5560000	5561000	I'm starting from the left.
5561000	5562000	Okay I'll get the right.
5562000	5563000	Okay.
5563000	5564000	Ready?
5564000	5566000	And Proops is with Hordegard.
5566000	5579000	Suddenly I chuck three teargrass grenades.
5579000	5581000	Who is this guy?
5581000	5585000	They call me Hippocrates.
5585000	5587000	You toss three teargas grenades.
5587000	5588000	That's right.
5588000	5590000	I heal people because I took an oath.
5590000	5594000	I heal people for the for the highest bidder.
5594000	5600000	They they bounce along the floor and one of them bounces into the gatehouse of the guarding the gate
5600000	5605000	and they all trigger going off unleashing acrid smoke into the air.
5605000	5609000	The guards start coughing and wheezing and freaking out.
5609000	5613000	And then you hear you hear a siren like a fire alarm going.
5613000	5614000	Jesus Christ.
5614000	5620000	Shit.
5620000	5621000	Do we know this guy?
5621000	5623000	Who's who's who's throwing grenades?
5623000	5624000	He's in your team.
5624000	5626000	He was there all along.
5626000	5627000	Okay.
5627000	5628000	All right.
5628000	5630000	Is there somebody that I can see?
5630000	5631000	Yeah.
5631000	5632000	You guys are together.
5632000	5634000	I'm a troll.
5634000	5636000	But I swore to heal people.
5636000	5638000	I have a gas mask.
5638000	5639000	I put it on.
5639000	5640000	All right.
5640000	5641000	Good call.
5641000	5644000	Are these guys are these guys immobilized or what are they doing?
5644000	5645000	They're coughing.
5645000	5650000	It's it's very you guys have opportunity to go right when you're seeing these things happen.
5650000	5651000	Okay.
5651000	5652000	Let's take a shot.
5652000	5653000	Take a shot.
5653000	5656000	I shoot as many people as I can.
5656000	5657000	Pop pop pop.
5657000	5658000	I pick off my guy.
5658000	5659000	All right.
5659000	5660000	What are your pistols?
5660000	5661000	Jeff.
5661000	5662000	I know Dan's pistols.
5662000	5663000	There's six.
5663000	5664000	Six altogether.
5664000	5666000	Four plus two six plus what?
5666000	5667000	Plus your agility.
5667000	5668000	Plus ten.
5668000	5669000	Ten.
5669000	5671000	Mine's a total of nine.
5671000	5672000	I remember.
5672000	5673000	All right.
5673000	5675000	You hit him directly in the chest.
5675000	5676000	It goes.
5676000	5681000	It pierces straight through their armor for Dan and knocks the guy on his floor.
5681000	5682000	He's bleeding out.
5682000	5687000	The other guy gets hit with three of your stick and shock rounds and you see some electrical
5687000	5691000	activity as he goes down to the floor convulsing.
5691000	5693000	There's one left quarter guard.
5693000	5694000	Take the shot.
5694000	5697000	I take the shot with my rifle.
5697000	5698000	All right.
5698000	5703000	What's your agility plus automatics is eight.
5703000	5704000	All right.
5704000	5705000	All right.
5705000	5706000	You also hit him.
5706000	5709000	His head explodes.
5709000	5713000	She nice shot as a peacock.
5713000	5714000	I knew this would happen.
5714000	5715000	This is why I took those actions.
5715000	5719000	You sure you're not German.
5719000	5722000	The alarm's still going off.
5722000	5723000	Hey.
5723000	5724000	Face Eve.
5724000	5725000	Yeah.
5725000	5726000	Mercy.
5726000	5729000	You got a keyboard taped to your stomach.
5729000	5734000	Do you do something about that alarm?
5734000	5737000	I can try.
5737000	5740000	I'm still wearing my business wear.
5740000	5741000	Yep.
5741000	5743000	I run inside.
5743000	5746000	I try to locate the alarm box.
5746000	5747000	All right.
5747000	5750000	You head inside the gate house and it's a pretty simple construction.
5750000	5754000	You see a switch that's activated that looks to be the alarm.
5754000	5755000	That's probably it.
5755000	5759000	Hello, my darling.
5759000	5769000	I walk up to the alarm and I'm using my attribute of composure.
5769000	5773000	I'm calm and I try to make sense of the alarm.
5773000	5775000	I try to flip off the alarm.
5775000	5776000	I'm using your composure.
5776000	5778000	You flip off the alarm.
5778000	5785000	The silence rains and also tear gas.
5785000	5788000	Sorry about the mess, but it's quiet.
5788000	5791000	Too quiet.
5791000	5794000	We still have that one guard inside that I only stunned.
5794000	5797000	Nightblade, you blew a dude's head off in there.
5797000	5799000	One guy's still down.
5799000	5801000	Spencer, do we know how long that stun lasts?
5801000	5803000	You know, an hour or two, a few hours.
5803000	5804000	Okay, so he's good.
5804000	5806000	Probably.
5806000	5808000	We still got a room back in there.
5808000	5812000	That's probably where the target is and we got to check all these crates for those chips.
5812000	5817000	You hear the sound of sliding metal as the loading bay door closes shut.
5817000	5819000	Behind you?
5819000	5820000	Probably.
5820000	5827000	Depending on your orientation.
5827000	5831000	The loading dock door is the only door into the warehouse?
5831000	5834000	Well, you guys came in through the ceiling, so...
5834000	5836000	But is there another door that we found or no?
5836000	5839000	Not one that I'm aware of.
5839000	5841000	Alright, so again, I'm sure...
5841000	5845000	That's the only door.
5845000	5847000	I'll go down the chimney.
5847000	5853000	And then I run up and I grapple up to the warehouse roof.
5853000	5856000	Alright, you do that.
5856000	5857000	I astrally perceive.
5857000	5860000	I go into a shamanic trance and I astrally project myself.
5860000	5865000	And I project myself inside the warehouse to go into the room where those machines were,
5865000	5867000	or just to check out the whole space.
5867000	5874000	Alright, you see about six bodies inside surrounded by machines and security devices.
5874000	5876000	Six bodies in the main room?
5876000	5878000	In the room that you haven't entered yet.
5878000	5885000	Okay, guys, do I detect any magic, any spirits in there, or just regular human beings?
5885000	5886000	Just humans.
5886000	5889000	Alright, guys, we got six bodies inside that room.
5889000	5898000	It's a little outside my jurisdiction.
5898000	5899000	Six bodies.
5899000	5901000	Are they dead?
5901000	5902000	No, they're living.
5902000	5906000	Can I use my ability to detect enemies?
5906000	5907000	What am I out of range?
5907000	5910000	No, you detect enemies.
5910000	5913000	You detect enemies.
5913000	5917000	There's five plus in the building.
5917000	5922000	So that means that everyone in that room, neither one of them is the person we're seeking.
5922000	5928000	I mean, it's not really been established whether the person you're seeking is an ally or an enemy.
5928000	5932000	So nobody's in the outside of the warehouse, they're all inside that room?
5932000	5933000	Correct.
5933000	5935000	Alright, guys, I'm going to go in there.
5935000	5936000	Let's all go in together.
5936000	5937000	Let's have each other's back here.
5937000	5938000	I'm going to go in there.
5938000	5944000	Before we do this, should I perhaps take this opportunity to take my rifle to the stunned one and maybe shoot him?
5944000	5945000	Yeah.
5945000	5946000	I'll do that.
5946000	5947000	I'm going to get in the building first.
5947000	5950000	So how do you want to do that?
5950000	5951000	Let's see.
5951000	5954000	I have a grappling gun.
5954000	5959000	Why don't we just just monofilament that door open, man?
5959000	5962000	Yeah, we'll be long gone by the time that guy wakes up.
5962000	5965000	Spencer, how does my stealth tag work?
5965000	5966000	That's like an RFID tag.
5966000	5968000	It's like a tracking bug, basically.
5968000	5970000	So you could stick it on stuff.
5970000	5972000	Alright, another time.
5972000	5977000	Is there time to light a cigarette while all this bullshit's going on?
5977000	5979000	Nightblade, monofilament that door open.
5979000	5980000	Let's go in there.
5980000	5986000	What I'll do is I can summon a spirit that goes in there and just knocks him out with noxious gas or something like that.
5986000	5990000	Winky doodle doo.
5990000	5996000	It's not a permanent workshop in catchphrases.
5996000	6001000	Spencer, am I in a space with one of those guards?
6001000	6006000	If you're in the gatehouse, there's a dead guard in it.
6006000	6015000	Okay, I take the dead guard's clothes and I put on his clothes and I'm going to use my skill of disguise to emulate his body language.
6015000	6022000	What's your intuition plus disguise?
6022000	6027000	My intuition is four and my disguise is three.
6027000	6028000	Seven.
6028000	6033000	Alright, you don it in disguise.
6033000	6036000	Alright, and I start walking towards the room.
6036000	6044000	Alright, meanwhile, Jim Nightblade attempts to monofilament whip the door open.
6044000	6052000	But your robot finger careens off the surface of the door, directing your monofilament whip directly right at you.
6052000	6058000	It slashes you. What's your armor?
6058000	6060000	Top right corner.
6060000	6063000	Top right.
6063000	6065000	Is it AP or what?
6065000	6066000	It'll say armors.
6066000	6067000	My old eyes.
6067000	6069000	It's armors.
6069000	6073000	I'm looking for the word armors and it's core combat info up top right.
6073000	6076000	It's just the number to the top-est right-est.
6076000	6078000	Oh, well, it's yeah, rating.
6078000	6079000	It says nine.
6080000	6082000	Alright.
6082000	6086000	Okay, so you cut yourself open right in the torso.
6086000	6089000	You're bleeding pretty heavily.
6089000	6091000	Thank goodness I'm here.
6091000	6094000	It sliced through your armor like butter.
6094000	6097000	Let me fix that right up.
6097000	6100000	The door stands unopened.
6100000	6104000	Let me try that again.
6104000	6106000	Are you sure?
6106000	6108000	No, you're all cut open.
6108000	6110000	Let me put some first aid on you.
6110000	6115000	Do I feel like that was just a critical failure or do I feel like that's what happens when I try to use my mono whip on you?
6115000	6119000	You feel like that's what happens when you critical failure with your mono whip.
6119000	6120000	Okay.
6120000	6122000	Yeah, hold on.
6122000	6123000	I'm gonna try again, sorry.
6123000	6125000	Don't be so tough, god damn it.
6125000	6127000	Let me stitch you up and try it again.
6127000	6130000	You're in a different, you're not in a building with me.
6130000	6133000	I'm here alone bleeding to death.
6133000	6135000	I'd love to get healed.
6135000	6140000	Apocrates, did anyone tell you that you sound a little bit like the coach from Major League?
6140000	6144000	God damn it, I'm about as proud of you boys as I've ever been.
6144000	6152000	I've ever coached in my entire fucking, get in the heat of Ricky.
6152000	6154000	Are you giving him first aid?
6154000	6155000	He's bleeding.
6155000	6156000	I'm in the warehouse.
6156000	6158000	You guys are, I'm trying to give you guys.
6158000	6159000	Well, you're outside the warehouse.
6159000	6160000	I'm with you outside the warehouse.
6160000	6161000	You're trying to get into the warehouse.
6161000	6162000	Yeah.
6162000	6168000	I wanted to grapple up to the ceiling, come down through the grate that I came through earlier.
6168000	6170000	Okay, and then what door were you cutting?
6170000	6175000	I thought that I had done that, so I thought I was cutting the loading dock door so that they could come in.
6175000	6178000	Okay, well then you're inside and you failed to cut the loading door, so yeah.
6178000	6181000	Okay, that's true.
6181000	6183000	Try it again and let us in.
6183000	6187000	Here we go again.
6187000	6190000	Hickory dickory dock.
6193000	6194000	All right.
6194000	6201000	This time, despite your heavy wounds, you managed to cut a man-sized hole in the loading dock door.
6201000	6202000	I jumped through.
6202000	6203000	All right.
6203000	6206000	Apocrates healed night, but he's bleeding bad.
6206000	6209000	You bet I will.
6209000	6214000	Let me take out my first aid kit here.
6214000	6219000	I've also got, I can heal.
6219000	6222000	It's best used after the first aid is applied.
6222000	6225000	Is that the title of your book?
6225000	6230000	It's a small pamphlet I've written.
6230000	6234000	Also, you received something from the Franklin Mint.
6234000	6239000	It's a tiny gold coin, just to let you know that I've been here.
6239000	6241000	I've stitched up a thousand fucking punks on the street.
6241000	6243000	I can stitch you up, too.
6243000	6244000	Jesus, thank you so much.
6244000	6249000	Oh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to take one of your kidneys.
6249000	6250000	I'm a troll.
6250000	6252000	I eat them after hours.
6252000	6254000	Oh, I got two.
6254000	6257000	I get one, bro.
6257000	6258000	This bump?
6258000	6259000	No, you can't.
6259000	6260000	You're too weak.
6260000	6263000	Here, have some analgesic.
6263000	6269000	You apply your first aid kit, and it seems to be taken quite effect.
6269000	6273000	The bleeding stops completely, and you're all...
6273000	6276000	The name's Hippocrates.
6276000	6278000	I go up to the door.
6278000	6279000	Oh, we're inside now, right?
6279000	6280000	Yeah.
6280000	6286000	I go up to the door, and I summon a spirit of error.
6286000	6291000	I summon a...
6291000	6292000	I fart.
6292000	6293000	Stop it, you have to pray.
6293000	6294000	I fart.
6294000	6299000	I summon a dog to blame it on.
6300000	6309000	I summon a storm cloud, a mist cloud, to go in under the...
6309000	6310000	It's getting worse and worse.
6310000	6315000	Under the door to breathe noxious breath on them.
6315000	6317000	So a level four spirit.
6317000	6318000	All right.
6318000	6319000	What's your sorcery plus...
6319000	6321000	No, conjuring plus magic.
6321000	6322000	Conjuring.
6322000	6323000	You mean summoning?
6323000	6324000	That.
6324000	6326000	Where are you summoning?
6326000	6328000	What did you have for breakfast?
6329000	6330000	Eleven is total.
6330000	6332000	All right.
6332000	6333000	And you set a four?
6333000	6336000	Also, I get plus two because it's a spirit of error.
6336000	6338000	So it's 13.
6338000	6339000	Okay.
6339000	6340000	Awesome.
6340000	6342000	You take serious drain.
6342000	6349000	You take about three boxes of drain as you summon forth this powerful misty creature.
6349000	6351000	It's there.
6351000	6354000	Spirit, go into the door and knock out the...
6354000	6357000	Breathe noxious breath and knock them down.
6357000	6358000	Okay.
6364000	6365000	All right.
6365000	6367000	The one who cast it, blast it.
6370000	6371000	Who swung the goat?
6373000	6377000	So the mist spirit goes under the door, right?
6377000	6378000	Yes.
6378000	6382000	Under the door and starts misting all over the place.
6383000	6385000	A little over here.
6385000	6387000	A little over here.
6390000	6391000	Is that accurate?
6391000	6392000	Is that what it sounds like?
6392000	6394000	I mean, I guess, sure.
6398000	6401000	Can I communicate with my spirits?
6401000	6403000	Yeah, you got a mind link to it.
6403000	6404000	How's it going in there, spirit?
6404000	6407000	Oh, this is fine.
6407000	6411000	It's been a rough day, but it's nice to be needed.
6413000	6417000	Did you breathe the noxious breath on those six guys in there?
6417000	6420000	Oh, yes, I started.
6420000	6422000	How did it come out?
6423000	6426000	The way it always comes out.
6426000	6431000	I just wish that for once the thing I was best at didn't hurt people.
6434000	6437000	Air spirit, I just want you to knock them out.
6437000	6438000	I don't want you to hurt anybody.
6438000	6440000	I just want them to be unconscious.
6440000	6443000	No, I knocked them out.
6443000	6446000	Just ask Spencer what happened.
6446000	6447000	Spencer, what happened?
6447000	6449000	They're all knocked out.
6457000	6462000	The wife is making soup later, and she always makes too much.
6462000	6464000	Thank you, spirit.
6465000	6467000	Oh, mist spirit.
6471000	6473000	Thank you, mist spirit.
6473000	6474000	You did good.
6474000	6478000	What a showstealer that farting ghost was.
6480000	6482000	You got to cast that thing.
6482000	6484000	Boy, I don't want to...
6484000	6487000	Sorry, I don't want to...
6487000	6490000	I don't want to get too enthusiastic, but...
6490000	6494000	Whoever dealt that thing really knew what it was doing.
6495000	6498000	Let's kick the door down and go get these guys,
6498000	6500000	and then we have to end the show.
6501000	6504000	I mean, we started at 8.15, I'm just saying.
6505000	6506000	Harks and alarms.
6506000	6507000	Oh, no.
6507000	6509000	Am I in the wrong phase?
6511000	6512000	Cross over.
6514000	6519000	Tizai, the prancing unicorn with the wandering menstrual show.
6520000	6523000	My golden hooves have heard that there is trouble in this land.
6523000	6525000	Some 500 years hence.
6526000	6528000	Tizai, Tylenol with codeine.
6533000	6536000	Nightblade, you are surrounded by a noxious gas.
6540000	6542000	Don't say anything, let me sit upon your face.
6544000	6546000	Codeine, kick that door down so we can get in.
6547000	6551000	It will be done by the flaming balls of Kelly Ripa.
6552000	6555000	Carash, carash, and I must away.
6556000	6558000	For another adventure I will go on.
6559000	6561000	I am not gay, and yet I make no case for it.
6561000	6563000	Collop, collop, collop, collop.
6569000	6571000	Who the fuck was that?
6572000	6575000	What kind of fruit basket are you conferring with, huh, Nightblade?
6576000	6577000	Yeah, it's weird.
6581000	6585000	How specific he got about his sexual preference at the end.
6586000	6587000	We didn't even bring it up.
6589000	6592000	At least he wasn't a black guy you brought up to rap.
6594000	6595000	That guy was good.
6596000	6597000	One of them was.
6599000	6600000	Is the door open?
6601000	6604000	Oh, yeah, it's been kicked in by a unicorn.
6606000	6610000	Spirit, will you inhale that noxious gas so we can go in there and enter safely?
6610000	6612000	Oh, the spirit's gone. He did his business. Now he's done.
6613000	6614000	I'll say.
6615000	6616000	All right.
6617000	6619000	All right. Is it safe for us to walk in there?
6620000	6621000	It might be a bit.
6621000	6624000	I still have my gas mask on. I walk in there and examine what's going on.
6624000	6626000	Just bag him and tag him. Look for the bald guy.
6626000	6630000	You see four, four young teenage druggies.
6630000	6632000	They're kind of just sprawled out on the floor.
6632000	6636000	They got microchips stuffed into their head skulls.
6637000	6639000	Get those chips. Gather them up.
6640000	6641000	Good call.
6641000	6646000	As you gather up the chips, the people come to and they're like, hey, man, give him that back.
6647000	6648000	Am I am I there?
6649000	6652000	Yeah, you guys are all at the door. He's the only one inside the room.
6652000	6653000	But yeah.
6653000	6657000	OK, with my with my power of convincing, look at the guys.
6657000	6660000	Hey, bros, go back to sleep, man.
6661000	6663000	Just ride that high.
6664000	6667000	All right. We're going to we're going to take away the bad ones.
6667000	6672000	There was some bad stuff that came down the shoe here and I'm just trying to help you out.
6672000	6678000	And also, I'll stun baton them like in case in case they don't.
6678000	6681000	I think they're OK. I think they're just druggies that were high on BTL chips.
6681000	6683000	And they're just coming out of the stupor right now, right?
6683000	6686000	Yeah, but we need to control the environment.
6687000	6689000	I look around. I only see four druggies.
6689000	6691000	And I look for the other two people that I saw.
6691000	6693000	I saw six bodies in there. Who the other two?
6693000	6697000	What's your perception plus intuition?
6700000	6702000	It is eight.
6702000	6704000	Eight. All right.
6704000	6710000	Using your keen eyesight, you see an empty table and behind the empty table,
6710000	6715000	a thin, almost imperceptible seam in the wall, a secret door,
6716000	6722000	a threshold worthy of probably, am I right?
6722000	6725000	Yep. Cliffhanger.
6728000	6731000	Let's thank Greg Proops for coming down again.
6731000	6732000	Greg Proops.
6732000	6734000	Jamorage Brown.

6740000	6746000	McGathey, Spencer Crittenden, Jeff Anastasia Davis.
6747000	6751000	Let's also thank Max and Brian for coming up and rapping with us.
