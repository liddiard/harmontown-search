0	12400	Welcome, everybody, to Harmon Town is now in session.
12400	13400	Love him.
13400	14400	Obey him.
14400	26120	As he pleases, welcome the mayor of Harmon Town, the goblin king, Dan Harmon.
26320	33320	My baby's love had gone and left her feeling blue.
36320	40820	What kind of magic spells to use?
40820	47720	Smiles and snails and puppy dog tails, thunder and lightning.
47720	55320	Sniffing bacon, jump, jump, magic dance, magic, jump, magic dance.
55520	59520	What kind of magic spells to use?
59520	64520	Magic, jump, magic, jump, magic, jump, magic, jump.
64520	67520	Magic, jump on me, sloth it in, sloth it in.
67520	69520	I think I did everything.
69520	70520	I did everything.
70520	72520	Welcome, everybody.
72520	78520	Here comes the flying baby.
78520	80520	Baby's flying at you.
80520	81520	There you go.
81520	87520	What the podcast listeners won't know is that Dan Harmon and the various members of our
87520	92520	Harmonion audience are dressed as Jareth tonight on an all-Labron-themed Harmon Town.
92520	93520	God bless you.
93520	97520	Check the website if you're out in the Internet world.
97520	102520	Just give it a cursory googling or go to, I don't know, HarmonTown.com is not up yet,
102520	106520	but go somewhere and look at a photo of us.
106520	109520	A very unusual bulge in your sweatpants.
109520	114520	It's realistically lateral.
114520	122520	I, in real life, am, of course, a grower, not a shower, meaning I have a tiny penis
122520	129520	that sort of recedes into a nipple above my giant ball sack.
129520	136520	What I did is I found a dog toy that I kind of anchored.
136520	139520	The good news is this is being well-photographed from the front row.
139520	143520	It's kind of a low-slung twine harness.
143520	146520	Let's see the harness.
146520	150520	This is what I've got.
150520	156520	We'll be giving this and many other things away throughout the show.
156520	162520	I'm not going to express disappointment with the lack of Jareth,
162520	169520	so what I will do is express joy and support for the Jareths that did show up.
169520	171520	Stand up, Jareth.
171520	173520	Be seen.
173520	176520	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
176520	178520	Oh, Black Jareth!
178520	180520	We have a Black Jareth.
180520	183520	Enty.
183520	187520	Enty said on Twitter that he wasn't going to have time
187520	190520	or you said you didn't have the money to put into a Jareth costume.
190520	194520	I said we would reimburse him because it's a special thing.
194520	196520	It's like a social program.
196520	199520	I was thinking there's a very good chance he'd be the only Black Jareth.
199520	201520	What's good is that?
201520	205520	It's like a diversity program, whatever that wig cost, whatever your gas costs.
205520	207520	See us after the show.
207520	210520	What's great is even a White Jareth gets into Tina Turner country.
210520	218520	Yeah, if Enty and I switched wigs.
218520	223520	Yeah, I'd do a Ramon and he'd be Tina Turner.
223520	227520	All right, so let's not address this all night.
227520	230520	Let's casually throw it over our shoulder.
230520	234520	Can we talk about the construction of your vest?
234520	237520	If you want.
237520	242520	Because from middle distance, if you squint your eyes, it's exactly the shape of the vest.
242520	247520	I just want to know more about its backstory, its origin.
247520	260520	For those who are only listening, I went for Jareth and I arrived at a kind of gay Han Solo.
260520	266520	By buying a woman's windbreaker and cutting it into the precise shape of David Bowie's,
266520	269520	what I would call his lead, he wears several outfits.
269520	270520	He's like a male barbarella.
270520	272520	He wears several outfits and labyrinths.
272520	274520	You never see him the same one twice.
274520	276520	I'm sure that was in his contract.
277520	281520	One of them, and the one where he sings Dance Magic Dance,
281520	287520	he's in kind of a leisure throne wear, kind of kicking back.
287520	288520	I would say you nailed it.
288520	290520	You got boots and everything.
290520	292520	Well, I look closer.
292520	294520	I didn't get actual boots.
294520	299520	I got ladies boots from Goodwill cut the tops of them off
299520	301520	because I couldn't find boots that would fit.
301520	302520	And put them over men's shoes.
302520	304520	Put them over my men's stiller shoes.
304520	305520	You made labyrinth spats.
305520	307520	Yep, labyrinth spats.
307520	309520	Spats, labyrinth spats.
309520	311520	Spats, labyrinth spats.
311520	313520	Put those magic spats on me.
313520	320520	I saw my boots too small to fit my manly feet.
321520	325520	What kind of came a prop to use?
325520	326520	Now Dan, are you a-
326520	330520	Jamba Juice lids glued into a sphere.
330520	332520	Are you a fan of the movie?
332520	336520	Because I've only seen it about twice.
336520	342520	And I've never- I only saw the ending today.
342520	344520	It's a good ending because I always hated Sarah in it
344520	346520	because she's kind of an unredemptive character
346520	348520	until the bitter end of that thing.
348520	350520	When she says, like, no, I'd rather-
350520	351520	I don't want all my wishes to come true.
351520	353520	I want to say as a baby, right?
353520	354520	Is that the idea?
354520	355520	Yeah, well, I'll tell you.
355520	357520	But until then, it's a lot of bickering.
357520	359520	As a professional storyteller,
359520	363520	I'm really not allowed to like that movie.
363520	370520	But as a moviegoer, as a fan of Hudson Hawk and Doc Hollywood,
370520	373520	I understand that it's Erin McGathey's favorite movie
373520	375520	and wouldn't take that away from her.
375520	377520	She has a passion for that movie
377520	380520	that I would liken to people of my generation's passion
380520	382520	for the Goonies, for instance.
382520	385520	I'm not saying labyrinth people are a different generation.
385520	386520	I'm just saying, like,
386520	388520	I never watched that labyrinth shit when I was a kid.
388520	391520	It looked a little- I can't say fruity.
391520	392520	That's homophobic.
392520	394520	It looked gay.
394520	395520	Yeah.
395520	397520	Yeah.
397520	399520	Way to avoid fruity.
399520	406520	It looked like it was exercising its God-given right to get married.
406520	410520	But to another movie with the same sexual organs.
410520	413520	But as an adult now, as a fan of David Bowie,
413520	415520	which I was not when I first saw that movie.
415520	416520	I didn't know Bowie.
416520	418520	Knowing Bowie now, it's pretty cool.
418520	420520	Because it's David Bowie going,
420520	423520	oh, forget about the baby, sir.
423520	426520	It's cooler now than it was then to me.
426520	427520	I mean, now it's cool.
427520	430520	Now you wish that bad movies should always be that good.
430520	432520	Also, that should be a special note.
432520	435520	I think, well, Time Bandits is a good example, too.
435520	437520	Like, Time Bandits is incredible.
437520	441520	If you were to say, I don't like Time Bandits,
441520	445520	there's guys that won't date you no matter how hot you are.
445520	447520	There's a deal breaker for them.
447520	448520	They won't do it.
448520	450520	A beautiful woman walks up to them.
450520	455520	The guy could have two heads and an extra butt or something
455520	458520	and just have no chance of ever procreating.
458520	460520	And then a supermodel could walk up to him.
460520	462520	And there's people out there that she would say,
462520	463520	I don't like Time Bandits.
463520	466520	I prefer Kevin Smith Dogma.
466520	469520	And there's people out there that are that passionate about Time Bandits
469520	471520	that they would tell her to take a hike.
471520	472520	Take a beautiful hike.
472520	476520	And I don't know if I would count myself in there.
476520	479520	I'm too old to care what movies you like or don't like.
479520	481520	Although if you said you like Dogma,
481520	483520	I'd probably tell you to go fuck yourself.
483520	487520	I think it's just a slippery slope,
487520	489520	like conversationally down the road.
489520	492520	Like, what kind of shit am I going to have to listen to?
492520	495520	If you think Dogma is a good movie, is it possible
495520	498520	you're going to think my face is a sandwich?
498520	501520	Am I going to wake up to you eating my face?
501520	503520	It has nothing to do with taste in movies.
503520	505520	I don't want to assert mine over years.
505520	507520	I just want to make sure I don't get murdered
507520	510520	because the disparity between Dogma and a good film
510520	514520	is similar to my face and a fucking sandwich.
514520	518520	There's that much difference happening.
518520	521520	Move your hands away from your bulge.
521520	525520	Give me a good profile there.
525520	527520	Perfect.
527520	529520	Sorry, I was just photographing.
529520	536520	Sarah, don't you know that magic is in my ball?
536520	539520	I've seen it twice too.
539520	541520	The other thing I was going to say...
541520	544520	It's a movie about a girl that doesn't like babysitting.
544520	547520	She wishes her favorite curse.
547520	549520	She's a very unlikable protagonist.
549520	552520	She wishes a goblin to take the baby away for good
552520	554520	because she hates babysitting.
554520	556520	And then David Bowie comes in with an owl.
556520	558520	I got your baby.
558520	559520	He says, you told me.
559520	562520	I only did what you told me to do, Sarah.
562520	565520	I took the baby.
565520	569520	You have till 12 o'clock to try to get it back.
569520	571520	13 o'clock, until 13 o'clock.
571520	577520	Goblin, goblin time.
577520	578520	So then I don't know why...
578520	580520	Well, we do know why it gives her a time limit
580520	582520	because this is my problem with the movie.
582520	584520	As he establishes in the third act, he's like,
584520	585520	look, you created me.
585520	588520	I just do whatever you want.
588520	589520	That's like one of those movies
589520	590520	where you're running from a vampire
590520	595520	and somebody goes, wait, we have to have faith.
595520	598520	We just have to stop being afraid.
598520	600520	It eats our fear.
600520	601520	I'm not afraid.
601520	604520	Well, then I'll go home.
604520	606520	Checking out on the monster clock.
606520	607520	That's not a story.
607520	609520	Wait, is 40-year-old David Bowie
609520	610520	falling in love with her
610520	612520	or is she falling in love with him or both?
612520	614520	Well, he's a manifestation of her.
614520	617520	So he's like a metaphor for her experimenting
617520	618520	with the cucumber.
618520	619520	I don't know.
619520	625520	He's a 13-year-old girl's version of a man.
625520	631520	So he looks like this.
631520	632520	A little better.
632520	636520	He looks a little better.
636520	638520	I wasn't fishing for salmon,
638520	640520	so don't give me a boot.
641520	646520	I coined a new colloquial phrase.
646520	649520	Jim Henson is the star of Labyrinth,
649520	652520	much as Ennio Morricone is the star of any...
652520	653520	Wait, I'm getting that wrong.
653520	655520	No, Ennio Morricone is the star of all the...
655520	657520	Who's the guy that directed the Spaghetti Westerns?
657520	658520	Sergio Leone.
658520	659520	Sergio Leone.
659520	660520	You see a certain...
660520	661520	Ennio Morricone.
661520	664520	Yeah, he's the real star of a lot of the Spaghetti Westerns.
664520	666520	Without the Morricone music,
666520	668520	what would some of those movies really be?
668520	670520	Jim Henson is the star of Labyrinth.
670520	672520	He's doing some amazing things like,
672520	675520	oh, there's a mouse riding a fucking pickle or something.
675520	678520	It's like they did it by using a regular-sized mouse,
678520	679520	and then the close-ups,
679520	681520	the pickle's got human feet coming out of it.
681520	682520	I don't know.
682520	683520	It's not my passion.
683520	684520	It's not...
684520	687520	I believe that stuff is a scam.
687520	690520	That's shrub shit.
690520	692520	I got to tell you...
692520	693520	Shrub shit.
693520	694520	Shrub shrub shit.
694520	695520	You're...
695520	696520	I'm looking at you,
696520	699520	and that wig is almost Lonnie Anderson.
699520	701520	It's a little...
701520	705520	It's 40% Lonnie, 60% Sammy, right?
705520	706520	Hagar?
706520	707520	Sammy Hagar.
707520	708520	I like to do that.
708520	709520	All right.
709520	711520	C.T. Deville.
711520	713520	Let's talk about race.
713520	714520	Let's talk about race.
714520	716520	Let's talk about Hoggle,
716520	720520	the swarthy little fellow that loves gold and jewelry.
720520	722520	Yeah, and kind of bargains his way.
722520	724520	Well, George Lucas knocked him off the map
724520	728520	with this weird, Semitic desert bargainer.
728520	729520	In episode one.
729520	730520	Yeah, in episode one.
730520	731520	I was like,
731520	732520	What can I do for you?
732520	733520	What?
733520	736520	You want your slave back?
736520	739520	With my trick knee?
739520	742520	This is a way to use the force?
742520	745520	That was no good.
745520	746520	And then we...
746520	748520	But Hoggle beat him to that punch, I would say.
748520	749520	Beat him to the punch,
749520	751520	but then no one remembers the first punch after.
751520	754520	It's like a George Lucas chop to the...
754520	755520	Down goes Frasier.
755520	758520	Holy craps.
758520	759520	Yeah, Labyrinth.
759520	760520	Jim Henson.
760520	767520	Good job, Jim Henson.
767520	768520	Yeah?
768520	769520	He was?
769520	770520	Aaron?
770520	771520	Should we bring Aaron up?
771520	773520	Sure, let's bring Aaron up.
773520	774520	Aaron McGathey.
774520	777520	It was her idea to all dress up as Jareth.
777520	779520	Labyrinth is Aaron's favorite movie.
779520	780520	She made us watch the movie.
780520	782520	We all decided to dress up as Jareth.
782520	788520	Let's hear it for Aaron McGathey's Jareth, everybody.
788520	793520	Aaron, tell us about George Lucas producing whatever you said.
793520	796520	George Lucas produced Labyrinth.
796520	798520	End of fact.
798520	799520	All right.
799520	803520	Well, thank you, Aaron.
803520	805520	Aaron, will you conduct...
805520	808520	Why don't you be a kind of Vanna White,
808520	809520	all sexism aside.
809520	812520	No, all sexism actually bunched in and magnified.
812520	816520	The kind of Vanna White, our costume acknowledgement.
816520	818520	I wouldn't even call it a contest.
818520	819520	Let's just make sure.
819520	823520	I feel like everyone's got a reasonable expectation
823520	827520	of a brief 15 seconds of stardom
827520	829520	if they put on some eyeshadow and a wig tonight.
829520	832520	There's at least one person out there that looks exactly like Jareth
832520	833520	from the movie Labyrinth.
833520	836520	By the way, Jeff, we haven't acknowledged for the podcast listeners
836520	842520	that Jeff is wearing what looks like a $50,000 Jareth costume.
849520	851520	It's not really a costume.
851520	853520	It's just Jareth.
853520	857520	He went out and commissioned people's help,
857520	859520	and he looks kind of like...
859520	861520	He's a passable David Bowie in the first place,
861520	863520	so with the eyeshadow and the wig, he looks like...
863520	865520	If this was a Labyrinth reunion,
865520	867520	and you said, like, Jareth's stunt double's here.
867520	870520	It should be said that the three of us watch this movie
870520	873520	because I really wanted them to see it.
873520	878520	I don't know, but the idea of us dressing like Jareth came up,
878520	880520	and Jeff was really enthusiastic about it,
880520	882520	and I think that's because he knows...
882520	883520	Because it was in my wheelhouse.
883520	884520	Yeah.
884520	886520	Oh, I see.
886520	889520	That's like if people are doing karaoke and they say,
889520	892520	oh, the thing's broken.
892520	894520	We can only use one of the CDs.
894520	896520	And they're like, oh, I don't know, use the George Michael one.
896520	898520	I don't know.
898520	899520	Right.
899520	902520	He's in my vocal register.
902520	905520	You do do a pretty good George Michael.
905520	907520	Well, I guess it would be nice.
907520	908520	Yeah.
908520	910520	There was one time when the three of us were at karaoke,
910520	912520	and Dan was singing George Michael,
912520	914520	and I turned to Jeff to say something,
914520	916520	and Jeff was like, dance singing.
916520	917520	Dance singing George Michael.
917520	918520	Yeah.
918520	919520	Your boyfriend's singing.
919520	921520	I'm so sorry.
921520	922520	But yeah.
922520	925520	Are you sure he said your boyfriend's singing?
925520	927520	He said our boyfriend's singing.
927520	930520	You guys look like two fourths of an awesome 80s band.
930520	931520	Yeah.
931520	932520	Yeah.
932520	933520	We're just...
933520	934520	Yeah.
934520	939520	We just came back from our bass player's funeral.
939520	944520	He put a two liter bottle of heroin up his ass and exploded.
944520	945520	A lac.
945520	946520	I don't know how.
946520	948520	Heroin works like Mentos, right?
948520	949520	Yeah.
949520	950520	Uh...
953520	954520	All right.
954520	956520	Well, let's hear it for our chorus of jereths.
956520	957520	Chorus of jereths.
957520	959520	Chorus of jereths.
959520	962520	This episode of Carmentown is brought to you by Fulton and Roark.
962520	966520	Jeff, you're sick of spilling all your colognes all over the place.
966520	967520	You hate liquid colognes.
967520	968520	Is that correct?
968520	969520	It's my nemesis.
969520	972520	It's the thing that gives me nightmare dreams all night long.
972520	974520	I can't remember how many times I've walked in on you,
974520	977520	just covered in sticky wet cologne.
977520	981520	I have traveled and broken a bottle of the cologne that I wear,
981520	985520	and then my luggage smells like a French whorehouse for the rest of time.
985520	986520	Yeah.
986520	989520	But Fulton and Roark is a men's fragrance and grooming company
989520	992520	that specializes in solid colognes, shave and shower products,
992520	995520	all designed to make getting ready easier and more enjoyable.
995520	998520	Now, when you say solid colognes, do you mean like solid in the jazz sense?
998520	1000520	Like, wow, that jazz solo was solid.
1000520	1004520	You know, I do mean that, but I also mean physically solid as well.
1004520	1007520	Oh, like a little, like you're talking about a wax-based cologne
1007520	1011520	that travels in a little small package that I can't spill all over my luggage
1011520	1015520	and smell like a Mexican tit house.
1015520	1018520	So these are travel-friendly wax-based colognes that can go anywhere.
1018520	1022520	Plus, there's nothing to break or spill, and of course, they all smell fantastic.
1022520	1023520	Fantastic.
1023520	1025520	Like a Mexican tit house.
1025520	1030520	I mean, there's different levels of Mexican tit house.
1030520	1032520	I mean, there's the high-quality ones,
1032520	1034520	there's the ones that you wish you didn't go to.
1034520	1035520	Right, yeah.
1035520	1037520	Titas Fantástico.
1037520	1040520	Is one of their fragrances called Mexican tit house?
1040520	1041520	Yeah.
1041520	1044520	Que Fantástico.
1044520	1047520	Fulton and Roark's bar soap is designed to exfoliate the skin
1047520	1049520	with or without a washcloth.
1049520	1050520	Also, you don't even have to touch it.
1050520	1052520	It comes in desert in the night.
1052520	1054520	Well, that's amazing.
1054520	1056520	That's literally unbelievable.
1056520	1060520	Did you know, Spencer, that GQ magazine just named their shave cream
1060520	1062520	the very best on the market today?
1062520	1064520	Well, yeah, of course I knew that.
1064520	1065520	Why would you ask?
1065520	1066520	I mean, who am I asking?
1066520	1067520	I mean, this guy.
1067520	1069520	You go to this house, it's like an episode of Hoarders.
1069520	1072520	So many back issues of GQ magazine there.
1072520	1075520	Right, and I got to tell you, my house is made out of bricks of cologne.
1075520	1077520	Wax-based cologne, I hope.
1077520	1078520	Yeah, yeah.

1108520	1112520	By FultonAndRoark.
1112520	1114520	Good job, Harmon Town.
1114520	1117520	This is a town to be proud of.
1117520	1120520	Well, do you want to do a little, like, resetting?
1120520	1123520	We could be pretty proud of that turnout.
1123520	1124520	That's pretty good.
1124520	1126520	I guess I implied that not enough people dressed as Jared at first,
1126520	1128520	but then 20 people got up here.
1128520	1130520	That was great.
1130520	1133520	It's my fervent wish that all the Jareds,
1133520	1137520	whichever among you can, that we all go to a bar afterwards
1137520	1140520	and I'll take over a bar dressed as Jared.
1140520	1145520	Everyone's invited, but I want to see 14 Jareds walk into a bar
1145520	1147520	and then let the joke ride itself.
1147520	1149520	Probably pretty easy to make that the drawing room, right?
1149520	1151520	Yeah, let's make it the drawing room.
1151520	1152520	See Mario's face?
1152520	1156520	L.A.'s premier shithole, the drawing room.
1156520	1159520	Yeah, Harmon Town is kind of unofficially sponsored by the drawing room.
1159520	1163520	Guests of Harmon Town, remember to tie your shoes
1163520	1166520	before you go to the men's room.
1166520	1169520	Because if you tie them after...
1169520	1171520	Hep C.
1171520	1173520	The drawing room, where if you drop your keys,
1173520	1179520	you get to walk home because some sort of vermin will steal your car.
1179520	1182520	You don't want to touch anything you drop with the drawing room.
1182520	1185520	Yeah, there was a carpet there once,
1185520	1187520	and they never tore it up, but it's not there anymore.
1187520	1189520	Yeah, they just let it go.
1189520	1192520	They just let people walk it all the way off.
1192520	1194520	There were a couple little tufts near the booths,
1194520	1196520	and they finally, some guy went with a putting knife
1196520	1200520	and got the last little vestiges of the carpet there.
1200520	1202520	There's a guy that goes there, and his name is Henry,
1202520	1206520	and he's a lovely, lovely old dude, and he's gone there forever.
1206520	1208520	And I remember going there maybe 10, 12 years ago,
1208520	1210520	and not cynically, I just thought,
1210520	1213520	this guy's probably, he's not going to be around much longer.
1213520	1216520	He's old, and he drinks a lot.
1216520	1218520	We might be getting the last of Henry.
1218520	1220520	He's still with us, and he looks exactly the same.
1220520	1222520	He's going to outlive us all.
1222520	1224520	I didn't know this, but he has a glass eye,
1224520	1227520	and I wasn't there, but one time he was there in the daytime,
1227520	1229520	and he coughed or sneezed,
1229520	1231520	and the couple people at the bar heard,
1231520	1233520	ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
1233520	1235520	And his eyeball had shut across the bar,
1235520	1238520	and then landed on the bar mat, like down on the ground there,
1238520	1240520	which is even grosser possibly than the carpet
1240520	1242520	that was still there at the time.
1242520	1244520	And the bartender, and he was looking around for it,
1244520	1246520	and he doesn't know where it sat,
1246520	1248520	and the bartender picked it up, washed it off,
1248520	1249520	and gave it to him, and he went,
1249520	1251520	put it right back in.
1251520	1253520	That's a good bar.
1253520	1256520	That's my kind of shit.
1256520	1260520	It's a bar so vile that hipsters will never take it over.
1260520	1262520	The gauntlet's been thrown down.
1262520	1264520	And one of the few bars that boasts a women's room,
1264520	1267520	it smells worse than a men's room.
1267520	1269520	I've only been in the women's room once,
1269520	1271520	but that men's room, holy tamale.
1271520	1274520	Yeah, there's bugs in there that don't exist
1274520	1276520	outside of the men's room or the dry room.
1276520	1278520	Yeah, Dino has a weird theory about that.
1278520	1280520	There's bugs that fly in your face
1280520	1282520	when you're standing at the urinal,
1282520	1284520	and he thinks that the reason they're there
1284520	1286520	is because of the pee that is on the wall
1286520	1288520	because you can never hit the urinal
1288520	1290520	because there's bugs in your face.
1290520	1292520	So he thinks it's a whole biosphere.
1292520	1295520	It's like an amazing Darwinian evolution
1295520	1297520	that these bugs have evolved.
1297520	1299520	No, they're, I mean, they don't know,
1299520	1301520	but the same way there's birds that drop walnuts
1301520	1304520	into traffic so that the cars crack the walnuts
1304520	1306520	and then they eat the nut meat.
1306520	1309520	These bugs, they literally live for one day,
1309520	1311520	so the last 30 years of the drawing room,
1311520	1314520	people peeing has been like millennia to them.
1314520	1315520	Yeah.
1315520	1316520	So you bet.
1316520	1317520	You bet it's a possibility.
1317520	1318520	There used to be doors in there,
1318520	1320520	but the bar opens at 6 a.m.,
1320520	1322520	and at both cocktail lounge, you open at 6 a.m.,
1322520	1324520	and so I think a lot of druggies were going in there,
1324520	1325520	and so the doors are now off there,
1325520	1327520	so you can't go in there and do drugs,
1327520	1330520	but now it's turned into this weird kind of like men's shower.
1330520	1331520	Like the whole thing has been designed
1331520	1333520	so when people puke or pee all over the place
1333520	1335520	because they will clean the bathroom there.
1335520	1338520	It'll be spic and span, and 10 seconds later,
1338520	1343520	there is a three-foot, like a three-point line of piss
1343520	1344520	around the thing.
1344520	1345520	Like you can't get close to it,
1345520	1347520	and then it's just receding
1347520	1349520	because now no one wants to step on the pee,
1349520	1351520	so now people are progressively peeing farther.
1351520	1353520	Everyone thinks they can hang from the rafters
1353520	1356520	and be the cleanest monkey to get out of the drawing room bathroom.
1356520	1360520	So then it's just like this exponential piss cycle
1360520	1361520	that goes on,
1361520	1362520	so they designed the whole thing now.
1362520	1364520	They have a thing they hook up,
1364520	1365520	which is like a car wash
1365520	1367520	where they just go in and steam the whole thing down.
1367520	1369520	And they just rinse the whole thing down,
1369520	1371520	and then it's shiny and new,
1371520	1372520	and then 10 seconds later.
1372520	1373520	Well, because the more they do that,
1373520	1375520	it's the broken window theory in New York,
1375520	1377520	you know, the pre-Gouliani whole thing
1377520	1380520	was the idea of the neighborhoods have a tipping point.
1380520	1381520	If you're walking down a street,
1381520	1382520	it's covered with garbage,
1382520	1383520	and all the windows are broken.
1383520	1385520	Like you'll break a window, you don't give a shit
1385520	1386520	if you walk down a pristine street.
1386520	1389520	I don't think it's that gallant of us.
1389520	1392520	I think we're just afraid to be the first person.
1392520	1394520	I think it's just sort of like cowardice.
1394520	1397520	And you can see it in European bathrooms.
1397520	1398520	I swear I went to Europe for the first time
1398520	1399520	a couple years ago,
1399520	1400520	and I was just marveling.
1400520	1402520	I was like, I went to dive bars.
1402520	1404520	The bathrooms were still a little cleaner
1404520	1406520	than the dive bars in America.
1406520	1411520	And my girlfriend at the time said that her theory was
1411520	1413520	that Americans are more germaphobic, too.
1413520	1417520	So we tend to try to take shits and pees
1417520	1419520	without touching anything,
1419520	1421520	and we end up making everything worse,
1421520	1422520	and the cycle continues.
1422520	1424520	Europeans are like, hey, it's my butt.
1424520	1425520	It's your butt.
1425520	1426520	I don't know.
1426520	1429520	We're both from Pennsylvania.
1429520	1436520	There were paper towels covered in shit
1436520	1439520	in the women's bathroom once at the drawing room.
1439520	1440520	There were what covered in shit?
1440520	1441520	Paper towels.
1441520	1442520	Oh, yeah.
1442520	1443520	Well, I mean...
1443520	1446520	Like coming out of the dispenser?
1446520	1450520	They came pre-shit on?
1451520	1454520	There was a trash can next to the toilet,
1454520	1458520	and there were paper towels covered in shit.
1458520	1461520	Sorry, guys.
1461520	1465520	Aaron, tell a ghost story or something,
1465520	1468520	or else it's weird that you're up here, right?
1468520	1469520	Well, Jeff told me to sit down.
1469520	1470520	No, I know, I know.
1470520	1471520	Or he told you to sit down.
1471520	1472520	Yeah.
1472520	1473520	I said, pull up a chair.
1473520	1474520	So you sat down.
1474520	1475520	It was her idea.
1475520	1476520	We're dressed as Jareth because of Aaron.
1476520	1477520	No, I know that.
1477520	1479520	I'm not doubting her value to humanity.
1479520	1482520	I don't want her to be uncomfortable sitting up here,
1482520	1484520	like Robin Givens or something.
1484520	1485520	Robin Givens?
1485520	1486520	Robin Quiver?
1486520	1487520	What's the...
1487520	1488520	Howard Sternlady?
1488520	1489520	He's a Howard Stern psychic.
1489520	1490520	Sorry.
1490520	1492520	I'll edit that out, and I'll seem witty.
1492520	1493520	I don't care.
1493520	1497520	Can you do a ghost story off the cuff?
1497520	1498520	Yeah.
1498520	1499520	All right.
1499520	1500520	Do you guys know the...
1500520	1501520	Can we lower the lights?
1501520	1502520	Here, hang on.
1502520	1504520	This is the only ghost story I know.
1504520	1505520	Is it about what sleeping with me
1505520	1507520	is going to be like tonight?
1507520	1508520	No.
1511520	1515520	I'm just going to tell the only ghost story I know.
1515520	1517520	And I'm not sure if I remember it.
1517520	1519520	Whoa.
1521520	1523520	Once upon a time in a town very...
1523520	1525520	Close to this one.
1525520	1531520	Maybe it was Oxnard.
1532520	1533520	It was just further away,
1533520	1537520	for six hours from this town,
1537520	1542520	in Oxnard, in a field.
1542520	1543520	Sorry, I'm trying to remember this right.
1543520	1546520	Okay, so there was this man, this old man,
1546520	1548520	who never talked to anyone for years and years
1548520	1550520	and years and years,
1550520	1551520	and after his wife died.
1551520	1553520	Oh, there was a man and his wife died,
1553520	1555520	and then he never talked to anyone for years and years.
1555520	1557520	Aaron McAfee, everybody.
1557520	1558520	There you are.
1558520	1559520	All right.
1559520	1560520	Thank you.
1560520	1561520	Imagine that happening.
1561520	1562520	That was horrifying.
1562520	1565520	I thought for a minute that story was going to go somewhere.
1569520	1571520	Jeff, you won't watch the movie Halloween, will you?
1571520	1573520	No, that movie fucked my shit up, man.
1573520	1574520	The original Halloween.
1574520	1575520	I had a fucking babysitter.
1575520	1576520	When did that movie come out?
1576520	1577520	Seventy-seven, eight?
1577520	1578520	Seventy-nine.
1578520	1579520	Seventy-nine.
1579520	1580520	Okay, so I was born in 73.
1580520	1582520	I was what, six-ish?
1582520	1585520	I had a babysitter, Megan O'Sullivan.
1585520	1587520	Megan, if you're out there, go fuck yourself.
1587520	1588520	Because she took...
1588520	1590520	Because I saw Jaws on her watch,
1590520	1592520	and I couldn't go into a pool for years,
1592520	1593520	and then I saw...
1593520	1594520	Well, you know what they say.
1594520	1596520	Fear is the best pacifier.
1596520	1597520	No!
1597520	1599520	I just figured Megan O'Sullivan is a...
1599520	1602520	You're doing a real dialect class tonight, man.
1604520	1607520	Please, continuing story, comrade.
1607520	1609520	Oh, thank you.
1609520	1610520	I'm like Robin Williams.
1610520	1611520	I remember being...
1611520	1613520	I don't know how movies worked back then,
1613520	1614520	but it wasn't like...
1614520	1615520	It was just pre-VHS,
1615520	1617520	but somehow we had Halloween at our house,
1617520	1620520	and I couldn't have been more than six or seven years old.
1620520	1621520	And we watched that,
1621520	1623520	and that movie really screwed me up,
1623520	1624520	and I had...
1624520	1625520	Because the thing about...
1625520	1626520	What's his name, Michael Myers?
1626520	1627520	Yeah.
1627520	1629520	The thing about him is he's supernatural,
1629520	1631520	because as soon as you look away, he's there.
1631520	1632520	He moves like a ghost.
1632520	1633520	He just happens...
1633520	1636520	Like you turn your head, and he sits up on the couch,
1636520	1637520	and it's scary.
1637520	1640520	He's got that ghostly inside-out William Shatner mask,
1640520	1642520	and it's freaky.
1642520	1644520	And I was just too young to watch it.
1644520	1646520	I don't think it would have scared me
1646520	1648520	if I watched it when I was 15,
1648520	1650520	because no other movies scare me at all.
1650520	1651520	When I was 18 years old,
1651520	1652520	my friends were having a party,
1652520	1653520	and they were like,
1653520	1654520	we're going to watch scary movies.
1654520	1655520	I'm like, what are you watching?
1655520	1656520	They go, we're going to watch Halloween.
1656520	1657520	I'm like, you know what?
1657520	1658520	I'm 18 years old.
1658520	1659520	I'm an adult.
1659520	1660520	I'm in college.
1660520	1661520	I'm going to watch this shit.
1661520	1665520	And fucking three more months of looking over both shoulders.
1665520	1666520	It's like...
1666520	1668520	Turn the light off when you go to bed
1668520	1670520	and then turn it back on again.
1670520	1671520	And then turn it off and turn it on again,
1671520	1672520	and go...
1672520	1673520	Maybe dive into the bed.
1673520	1674520	Like, for real.
1674520	1675520	I was a grown man.
1675520	1676520	And I won't watch it.
1676520	1677520	And even when it's on,
1677520	1678520	those commercials for it,
1678520	1679520	and I see that mask,
1679520	1682520	it just represents me looking over my shoulder.
1682520	1683520	I was too young for that.
1683520	1685520	I don't think there's anything that scares me like that.
1685520	1687520	I just don't like those modern horror movies.
1687520	1688520	Modern.
1688520	1690520	Now it's probably 20 years old.
1690520	1693520	Event Horizon is a perfect example of one of these.
1696520	1698520	You're laughing because I said modern
1698520	1700520	when I was talking about Event Horizon.
1700520	1703520	I rented it at Blockbuster.
1703520	1704520	That's new.
1705520	1706520	What is Event Horizon about?
1706520	1707520	I've never heard of it.
1707520	1708520	I've never heard of it.
1708520	1710520	It's about a spaceship that can go faster than the speed of light.
1710520	1712520	But it turns out when you go faster than the speed of light,
1712520	1714520	you go through hell.
1714520	1715520	Whoa!
1715520	1717520	Because time stops or whatever.
1717520	1720520	Hell being defined as whatever, uki-buki,
1720520	1722520	like whatever thing, you know,
1722520	1724520	your greatest fears or regrets or dead wives.
1724520	1726520	So everybody aboard the ship, of course,
1726520	1728520	has a, I lost a popsicle once,
1728520	1730520	and then they see a popsicle.
1730520	1731520	It's a dumb movie,
1731520	1734520	but this is the thing about modern horror
1734520	1737520	as opposed to John Carpenter's stuff.
1737520	1740520	Pop the champagne.
1740520	1743520	John Carpenter, just fuck it.
1743520	1745520	The masters of horror in the back.
1745520	1748520	We'll never be dethroned, boys.
1748520	1751520	John Carpenter goes into every location with some champagne
1751520	1752520	in case someone mentioned it.
1752520	1753520	Just in case.
1753520	1758520	He's wasted six hours this week watching Jonah Ray stand up
1758520	1759520	and just waiting.
1759520	1761520	That champagne's so hot and flat.
1761520	1763520	It's not even worth drinking right now.
1763520	1764520	He goes to Super Bowl.
1764520	1766520	He's just holding it all the time.
1766520	1768520	God, this Patton Oswalt guy goes on forever.
1768520	1771520	Just say something about me, John Carpenter.
1771520	1772520	Let me pop this fucker.
1772520	1776520	It's from 1948.
1776520	1783520	The Event Horizon, these new horror movies, as I call them,
1783520	1786520	the thing is that they go, like, you know,
1786520	1789520	the guy will be looking in the mirror in his medicine chest.
1789520	1790520	He's brushing his teeth,
1790520	1793520	and then he'll close the medicine chest door.
1793520	1794520	Oh, and you're expecting to see a thing?
1794520	1796520	No, you don't want to see a thing.
1796520	1797520	And he's, like, looking in the mirror.
1797520	1802520	And then it just hard cuts to, like, a different lighting
1802520	1804520	of a woman with blood streaming down her face,
1804520	1806520	and it just goes, ah, no!
1806520	1809520	It just, it's not, that's not fear.
1809520	1810520	That's startling.
1810520	1815520	That's just a thumbtack on your chair.
1815520	1816520	That doesn't count.
1816520	1818520	That doesn't, I don't like that.
1818520	1819520	I don't like being startled in a movie.
1819520	1820520	You could do that.
1820520	1822520	That doesn't take any craftsmanship.
1822520	1825520	How old are you when you first saw Labyrinth, Erin?
1825520	1830520	Oh, thanks for cheering for age.
1830520	1831520	I was six?
1831520	1832520	Yeah.
1832520	1833520	Seven?
1833520	1834520	Did it scare you?
1834520	1835520	The first scene, and the better.
1835520	1836520	There's a scene that seems pretty scary for kids
1836520	1837520	in the beginning, yeah.
1837520	1838520	Yeah, the scene in the mirror.
1838520	1839520	I noticed that as the writer of Monster House.
1839520	1842520	I have a keen eye for this stuff.
1842520	1843520	I wrote a movie that I-
1843520	1844520	Pop!
1844520	1845520	Pop!
1846520	1849520	Every time my friend mentions his own movies,
1849520	1851520	I pop champagne.
1854520	1856520	Kids get scared pretty easily, little kids.
1856520	1859520	Even today, even in this post-horse dick internet world
1859520	1864520	of they've seen everything, little kids still get scared.
1864520	1867520	PhD. Post-horse dick.
1867520	1869520	After Labyrinth, nothing was post-dick,
1869520	1871520	because it's just bulge.
1871520	1873520	And he's bouncing an infant on it,
1873520	1876520	just a rigid codpiece the entire time.
1876520	1878520	It's really, it's really horny.
1878520	1881520	He's older than I am in that movie, right?
1881520	1882520	How old is Bowie in that movie?
1882520	1883520	He's got to be older than 39, right?
1883520	1884520	I don't know.
1884520	1887520	And he's coming on to, what, 15-year-old?
1887520	1888520	14.
1888520	1889520	She's 14.
1889520	1891520	But he's her fantasy.
1891520	1892520	And he-
1892520	1894520	He's her fantasy.
1894520	1895520	Yes.
1895520	1899520	Also, I watched the behind-the-scenes documentary
1899520	1900520	again today.
1901520	1903520	It's Monday.
1905520	1907520	Tomorrow's vitamin day.
1907520	1910520	I'm going to watch vitamins all day tomorrow.
1910520	1912520	So Bowie's talking about the Goblin King,
1912520	1917520	and he says, well, he doesn't choose to have her there.
1917520	1920520	He's reluctant, but then he's forced into this world.
1920520	1923520	His explanation is nothing that I think anyone has ever thought.
1923520	1925520	He sat down with Jim Henson.
1925520	1927520	Jim Henson's like, yeah, fine.
1927520	1928520	That's your explanation.
1928520	1932520	That the Goblin King doesn't want to be the Goblin King.
1932520	1935520	But because he's there, he may as well do a good job.
1935520	1937520	And that's-
1937520	1938520	So that's, you know-
1938520	1939520	But, yeah, Jennifer Connelly was 14.
1939520	1941520	See, you see that the Goblin King spends most of his time
1941520	1944520	hanging out in a dungeon with 50 asshole puppets.
1946520	1947520	Well, now you know why,
1947520	1950520	because half of the movie was written by a fucking guitarist.
1952520	1953520	For real?
1954520	1955520	I'm just saying.
1955520	1957520	You want a good story, don't go to, you know, David Bowie.
1957520	1958520	David Bowie didn't write the movie.
1958520	1960520	Well, David Bowie didn't write the story of Terry Jones.
1960520	1961520	Terry Jones wrote the movie.
1961520	1964520	He came up with the character, like motivation.
1964520	1965520	No, he came up with the science.
1965520	1967520	That's the thing about the movie that doesn't make any sense to me.
1967520	1969520	There's no stakes, we call them.
1969520	1972520	You know, as we say at Denny's and in writing.
1973520	1974520	You need stakes.
1975520	1976520	Back to time bad.
1976520	1979520	Who here is the biggest labyrinth fan out here?
1979520	1980520	Other than Aaron.
1980520	1983520	Someone think that they're a bigger labyrinth fan than Aaron?
1983520	1984520	John Carpenter.
1987520	1988520	John Carpenter.
1989520	1990520	It's BJ.
1990520	1991520	Oh, my God.
1991520	1992520	It's John Carpenter.
1992520	1993520	Come on up here, John Carpenter.
1993520	1995520	Yeah, we got John Carpenters in the house.
1996520	1997520	BJ.
1997520	1998520	Wow.
1998520	1999520	You're looking very French.
1999520	2000520	A surprise?
2000520	2001520	No, it's John Carpenter.
2001520	2002520	Wait, I don't know what's really.
2002520	2003520	John Carpenter.
2003520	2004520	Wait, what are we talking about?
2004520	2005520	Labyrinth?
2005520	2006520	You're going to stick up for Labyrinth, yeah.
2006520	2009520	One, humans and puppets.
2010520	2011520	Together.
2012520	2013520	But real.
2013520	2015520	Not like the Muppets.
2016520	2017520	Two.
2017520	2018520	No, no, no.
2018520	2020520	Exactly like the Muppets.
2020520	2022520	It's exactly like the Muppets.
2023520	2025520	They're both as real as each other.
2025520	2026520	No, no.
2026520	2028520	The Muppets are actors.
2029520	2030520	So.
2030520	2031520	Two.
2031520	2032520	You've got.
2032520	2033520	Oh, I see.
2033520	2034520	The Muppets are playing actors.
2035520	2037520	It's not like the Larry Sanders show.
2037520	2038520	They're not.
2038520	2039520	Well, it kind of is.
2039520	2041520	It's kind of behind the scenes.
2042520	2043520	John Carpenter.
2043520	2047520	Do you mean that there are little people that are playing the puppets?
2047520	2048520	Is that what you mean?
2048520	2049520	Like it's different.
2049520	2050520	And that.
2050520	2051520	No.
2051520	2052520	No, no, no.
2052520	2054520	I'm saying Fozzy Bear.
2054520	2055520	Right.
2056520	2058520	Kermit, Miss Piggy.
2058520	2059520	Animal's in a band.
2059520	2060520	So he's a musician.
2060520	2061520	But they're actors.
2061520	2062520	They're not.
2063520	2065520	Oh, they're actors on the Muppet show.
2065520	2066520	Yeah.
2066520	2069520	So like when you see them like, oh, we got to get to New York or whatever.
2069520	2070520	It's like, yeah.
2070520	2071520	Because you're actors.
2074520	2080520	So you're saying that as an everyman, which you obviously are, you find it less relatable
2080520	2082520	to watch a showbiz show.
2082520	2085520	There's more verisimilitude when the puppets are goblins.
2086520	2089520	When puppets are actors, that's crazy.
2091520	2096520	In the behind the scenes documentary, Jim Henson is talking about why he wanted to make
2096520	2097520	the movie.
2097520	2102520	And him and Terry Jones say like, well, like we just wanted to make a movie again with
2102520	2105520	puppets and people that's like Dark Crystal, but fun.
2106520	2107520	And goblins, maybe.
2107520	2109520	It was such a loose idea.
2109520	2111520	And so great that it became such a great movie.
2111520	2117520	I was sitting at the pikey, the bar a couple blocks up the street here on Sunset Boulevard
2117520	2119520	as I do every harm in town.
2119520	2121520	And I was sitting there by myself at the bar.
2121520	2123520	That was a little out of place on a Monday.
2125520	2126520	It's two days before Halloween.
2126520	2127520	It's not a weekend.
2127520	2128520	Nobody else was in costume.
2129520	2133520	I mean, if I had gone to the Rainbow Room, I would have been just every other guy in there.
2133520	2134520	Yeah.
2134520	2136520	Some chick dressed as a cat would have given you a hand job.
2136520	2137520	You would have been fine.
2137520	2138520	Yeah.
2139520	2141520	But also it's near Halloween.
2141520	2142520	People can dig it.
2142520	2143520	And no one's given me any business.
2143520	2144520	But there's one guy sitting next to me.
2144520	2146520	He's like two stools down.
2146520	2148520	And he's like, yeah, fucking hate Hollywood.
2148520	2151520	You know, I live downtown, you know, downtown.
2151520	2153520	Hollywood's kind of anathema to me.
2153520	2154520	I don't go to Hollywood.
2154520	2155520	Hollywood's kind of bullshit.
2155520	2157520	I mean, I'm here right now, but I'm kind of slumming it.
2157520	2158520	You know, I live downtown.
2158520	2160520	You know, I rode my bicycle here.
2160520	2161520	I'm a bicycle guy.
2161520	2164520	And he looks over me and he goes, huh, yeah.
2164520	2166520	I loved you in Dark Crystal, man.
2166520	2167520	So anyway.
2168520	2170520	I don't know where to begin analyzing that.
2170520	2175520	My indignation was more righteous than any other time in my life.
2175520	2178520	He thought you were just hanging out at the pike he dressed like that.
2178520	2181520	No, I think he's just a douchebag who thinks he didn't know it all.
2181520	2183520	He was just on a flow.
2183520	2185520	He has to put his fingerprint on everything around him.
2185520	2187520	He just moved downtown.
2187520	2188520	So he's like, holy shit.
2188520	2189520	I know everything.
2189520	2190520	Also, I ordered.
2190520	2192520	I said, I'll have a Sam Smith logger on a Fernet Bronch.
2192520	2194520	He goes, oh, man, I love Fernet Bronch.
2194520	2196520	I mean, I live in San Francisco for a while.
2196520	2197520	Fernet Bronch.
2197520	2200520	He was trying to engage me, but I let my wig, like, be my earmuffs.
2200520	2203520	And I just had my collar be my cocoon.
2203520	2206520	And I just, like, I just Iglued myself in.
2206520	2210520	And because I'm, you know, in my wig, in my boots, I'm nine feet tall in this costume.
2210520	2212520	And he was a little shrimpy fucker.
2212520	2216520	He was just trying to affect everybody in the goddamn bar, which is the worst.
2216520	2222520	He just broke up with his girlfriend and he re-ikea-ed the missing stuff in his loft.
2222520	2224520	He filled in all her missing spots.
2224520	2228520	He was sitting in a bar in Hollywood, trying to talk about how uncool Hollywood is.
2228520	2229520	There's a case for that.
2229520	2231520	Hollywood kind of blows in lots of ways.
2231520	2233520	There's also good things about Hollywood.
2233520	2236520	For instance, Harmontown, for one.
2236520	2237520	That's in Hollywood.
2237520	2239520	And the nerdiest time being, that's in Hollywood.
2239520	2241520	Until such times it can get emancipated.
2241520	2242520	Yeah, absolutely.
2242520	2246520	But this guy was just like, every time anybody ordered a drink, he had to like weigh in on it.
2246520	2248520	And he took a lot longer.
2248520	2250520	Two olives. Nice. Dirty.
2250520	2252520	Like a bat flew into his face.
2252520	2253520	He'd be like, fruit bat. Nice.
2253520	2255520	It doesn't drink blood. A lot of people don't know that.
2255520	2257520	He's just a hip Cliff Clavin.
2257520	2260520	He wasn't Cliff Clavin. Cliff Clavin had information.
2260520	2261520	This guy was like, I don't like that.
2261520	2263520	I know about it. I've heard about it. I don't like it.
2263520	2264520	I'm above that.
2264520	2269520	But then he waited way longer to weigh in on me because I think he had to wait a half hour
2269520	2274520	to hear me finally order a drink and to hear that I wasn't going to sound like David Bowie.
2274520	2278520	Because I was like, oh, don't be cruel to me.
2278520	2280520	I'll be cruel to you if you don't get me.
2280520	2285520	If I don't order my drink, you have no idea. Don't forget about the baby.
2285520	2289520	If I'd have committed to that, I don't think he would ever have fucking turned to me,
2289520	2290520	like turned to me at all.
2290520	2294520	But I was like, oh, yeah, when you get a chance, I'll have a...
2294520	2296520	You forgot my glass memory over here.
2297520	2298520	Everybody creep me high.
2298520	2301520	And then he was like, yeah, nice job in Dark Crystal, bro.
2301520	2303520	And then he just fucked off to the bathroom like that.
2303520	2306520	Like it was like a slam dunk and mic drop and he went off to the thing.
2307520	2308520	Chris Rock to the bathroom.
2308520	2309520	Yeah.
2309520	2312520	Spencer, you better get up here and set up your gear.
2312520	2314520	Oh, shit. Spencer, everybody, our dungeon master.
2321520	2322520	Yeah.
2323520	2330520	Dan, can you, both of you, can you guys quote Labyrinth a little more?
2331520	2335520	Your quotes are just like a degree off.
2335520	2338520	What's the one he goes, shit.
2341520	2342520	Sarah.
2342520	2345520	Don't define me, Sarah.
2345520	2349520	I've been very generous, but I can be very cruel.
2349520	2351520	Something like that, close?
2352520	2357520	It's like he's written by instructions for a Wii game.
2359520	2362520	He just sort of says things the way they are.
2363520	2365520	Kind of a long winded way.
2365520	2370520	Sarah, you didn't know that imagination had things in store for you?
2371520	2372520	He doesn't really say anything.
2372520	2373520	It's like...
2373520	2377520	Most of the dialogue is her muttering to herself because she's walking around half alone in a labyrinth.
2377520	2379520	It's not fair.
2379520	2380520	It's not fair.
2380520	2383520	It's so hard to get to this labyrinth.
2384520	2385520	You know what I should do?
2385520	2389520	I should stop walking to the labyrinth the way I'm walking to the labyrinth.
2389520	2393520	Well, if you do that, then you won't know which way you're going.
2394520	2396520	What are you, a wall person?
2396520	2402520	Well, you could call me an earth butterfly, but I call myself a butterfly earth.
2403520	2404520	But that's not fair.
2404520	2407520	No, fair is in the eye of the beholder.
2407520	2409520	I'm putting my eye out and holding it around.
2409520	2410520	I hate you.
2410520	2412520	Well, hate means love here.
2413520	2415520	But that's not fair.
2415520	2418520	Oh, but soup tastes bad and the sky is pink.
2418520	2420520	No, but it was me the whole time.
2420520	2423520	I was the earth butterfly the entire time.
2423520	2424520	No.
2429520	2432520	Well, then I choose to not listen to you.
2432520	2434520	No, but that's not your choice to make.
2434520	2438520	I'm afraid I'm going to turn the clock into a calculator and subtract two.
2438520	2440520	No, you can't do that.
2441520	2443520	I want to be a good babysitter, okay?
2443520	2448520	But didn't the first, the opening act of this movie start with you hating babysitting?
2449520	2450520	But I don't mean it anymore.
2450520	2451520	I changed my mind.
2452520	2455520	This is a realm where nothing means anything, Sarah.
2456520	2458520	Then you don't mean anything.
2458520	2459520	Wait, what?
2459520	2460520	No, stop saying that.
2460520	2462520	You don't mean anything.
2462520	2464520	This whole movie didn't matter.
2464520	2468520	One, two, three, bumblebee.
2469520	2472520	The whole house is back to normal and the baby's here.
2472520	2476520	Now there's two babies and there's muppets in my room, whatever the fuck.
2476520	2479520	Including the ones that were trying to rip my fucking head off.
2480520	2485520	Technically speaking, and the ones who tried to impale me with pikes.
2486520	2488520	I was so flattered.
2488520	2491520	My heart was so warmed when you guys wanted to dress up.
2491520	2492520	We wanted to talk.
2492520	2494520	It's an intervention, Aaron.
2495520	2499520	We all dressed as Jareth tonight because we knew it was the only way you'd come.
2499520	2501520	This movie has story problems.
2502520	2504520	It's no monster house.
2504520	2509520	I mean, where is the revelation that the whole thing is because a fat lady died?
2510520	2513520	Where's the point in the story that Joseph Campbell calls for,
2513520	2517520	where after they get barfed up by the monster and they have tea for a fucking hour?
2517520	2518520	Haven't seen it.
2518520	2520520	I'm grinding some axes about a movie.
2520520	2521520	No one's seen.
2522520	2524520	Yeah, it's not the best movie, but the thing is, I like it.
2524520	2525520	I like watching it.
2525520	2527520	However, I can't get through the motherfucker.
2527520	2528520	I can't make it.
2528520	2529520	I can't.
2529520	2532520	I cannot make it to the end of the labyrinth because it's just too much.
2532520	2538520	I can't live within you.
2541520	2545520	You are my eyes and heart.
2546520	2550520	When he's walking on the M.C.
2550520	2559520	Asher's there goes, you know, I sing things that aren't melodies.
2562520	2564520	Can we talk about time bandits?
2565520	2566520	Talk all you want.
2566520	2568520	You'll just get lynched by nerds after the show.
2568520	2571520	Your car will be spray painted Yoko.
2576520	2577520	I'm not saying it's fair.
2578520	2581520	All those beetle loving nerds out there.
2583520	2589520	Well, I enjoy time bandits, but to me time bandits is and it's written by another member of Monty Python.
2589520	2593520	It's the same thing or the same weird themes.
2593520	2597520	It's the same like anti-parent fantasy, strange jumble.
2597520	2599520	And you love that movie.
2599520	2602520	It takes more than a theme to make a movie.
2602520	2604520	All I'm saying is that labyrinth isn't Citizen Kane.
2604520	2607520	I will say the same about time bandits and I will say the same thing about Goonies.
2607520	2610520	I think that Back to the Future has reasonably tight structure.
2610520	2612520	A lot of our favorite movies don't.
2612520	2618520	Like a lot of what we love about movies are the actors and their performances and especially like the emotional.
2618520	2621520	I'll use the word gestalt not knowing what it means.
2623520	2627520	That kind of like, especially when we're kids, like we don't even watch movies the same way.
2627520	2630520	We don't experience a story like really the same way.
2630520	2634520	We kind of like, you know, we just sort of see images and kind of feel feelings.
2634520	2636520	And I mean, name another movie.
2636520	2638520	Maybe I'm wrong, but name another.
2638520	2640520	Used Cars.
2640520	2642520	Beethoven.
2642520	2644520	Problem Child 2.
2644520	2646520	Used Cars?
2646520	2648520	Is that a movie?
2648520	2650520	Yeah, it's a Robert Zemeckis movie.
2650520	2652520	Robert Zemeckis opens a can of Coke.
2652520	2654520	Kurt Russell.
2654520	2658520	Name another movie because there are several movies.
2658520	2659520	Silver Streak.
2659520	2660520	I'm sorry.
2660520	2661520	There are several.
2661520	2662520	I love that we're all dressed.
2662520	2664520	The Great Train Robbery.
2664520	2667520	Name another movie.
2667520	2669520	Chicken Papel on one or two.
2669520	2678520	To my knowledge, there aren't any other movies that are starring a, now granted, like David Bowie acted in other movies.
2678520	2681520	But in this movie, he is a rock star.
2681520	2682520	He wrote all the songs.
2682520	2687520	I can't think of another movie where there is a musician who gives such an amazing performance.
2687520	2689520	And also, the songs are great.
2689520	2691520	Every Elvis movie.
2691520	2692520	Purple Rain.
2692520	2693520	Purple Rain.
2693520	2694520	Oh, shit.
2694520	2695520	By the way, I don't know if you guys know this.
2695520	2697520	I dressed as Prince of Purple Rain today.
2697520	2702520	Yeah, I was going to say, change wigs with Enzi and be a fucking kick-ass...
2702520	2707520	I didn't finish the sentence with puppets.
2707520	2710520	Uh...
2710520	2712520	Is there a puppet in Purple Rain?
2712520	2716520	Yeah, he uses it to passive-aggressively shut down Wendy or Lisa.
2716520	2719520	In your face.
2719520	2721520	Well, Wendy can go fuck herself.
2721520	2723520	Yeah.
2723520	2731520	Well, I think I'm speaking for many women and many gay-leaning men.
2731520	2734520	That David Bowie, that, where you're like...
2734520	2738520	I mean, he taught me how to sex.
2738520	2739520	I don't know.
2739520	2741520	He taught me like that.
2741520	2743520	Did he teach you how to conjugate?
2743520	2750520	You remind me of the sex.
2750520	2751520	Who do conjugate?
2751520	2752520	You do?
2752520	2753520	I conjugate.
2753520	2754520	Sex conjugate with who?
2754520	2755520	With who?
2755520	2756520	I'll call my baby.
2756520	2761520	I learned how to do things not.
2761520	2763520	I Yoda talk.
2763520	2766520	I was using bad grammar to be poetic.
2766520	2768520	He taught me how to sex.
2768520	2772520	He made you so hardy you became Native American.
2773520	2775520	No, it's...
2775520	2778520	He Titanka, my fallopian tubes.
2778520	2784520	I'm making it more important than it was, I guess.
2784520	2785520	You were so handsome.
2785520	2787520	No, there's no debate.
2787520	2789520	I mean, there's obviously...
2789520	2792520	There's contention raging, but...
2792520	2795520	In America, we have a problem.
2795520	2797520	I think this is the infantilization of America.
2797520	2800520	We've been raised through countless generations now
2801520	2803520	to think that this is how we express our personalities
2803520	2805520	and that we're either right or wrong,
2805520	2807520	like that we have favorite movies,
2807520	2810520	and movies are good or bad, and we argue about them.
2810520	2812520	You can see that reflected in the politics, too.
2812520	2814520	It's like we're being had.
2814520	2816520	I mean, you're allowed to think of...
2816520	2817520	How?
2817520	2820520	It's still on top of my dick.
2820520	2822520	You just did the same thing as if this ball
2822520	2824520	was on the end of that microphone
2824520	2827520	and you malleted my dick with it.
2827520	2829520	There's a dick there.
2829520	2830520	Oh, sorry.
2830520	2833520	It was in her right when you are game-saying
2833520	2837520	her opinion to attack your cock.
2837520	2839520	I'm very sorry.
2839520	2844520	She's been very generous, Dan, but she can be very cruel.
2844520	2848520	You can forget about your penis.
2848520	2850520	But I told you I want my penis.
2850520	2854520	Yeah, but why don't you tell it to the hand holding the crystal
2854520	2856520	because the crystal doesn't understand.
2856520	2857520	Okay, fine.
2857520	2860520	Hand holding crystal, I want my penis.
2860520	2862520	Those are the words?
2862520	2864520	She got the words wrong.
2864520	2866520	This isn't fair. It's not fair.
2866520	2868520	You keep saying that, don't you?
2868520	2874520	I don't like fairness.
2874520	2878520	You guys hate this movie.
2878520	2880520	It's not the best.
2880520	2881520	I tried to watch that fucker.
2881520	2882520	I put my makeup together.
2882520	2883520	I'm doing screen captures.
2883520	2884520	I'm like, this movie is fucking...
2884520	2886520	This scene goes on forever.
2886520	2888520	It's elaborate.
2888520	2890520	I chose Ballroom Bowie.
2890520	2893520	They don't show this fucking costume once.
2893520	2895520	He spins by.
2895520	2900520	It's all this ice-wide shut masquerade shit going on.
2900520	2902520	Show me the costume.
2902520	2903520	Show me the costume.
2903520	2904520	Show me the costume.
2904520	2906520	Well, that would have made it a good movie.
2906520	2907520	Yeah, show me the costume more.
2907520	2909520	Show me some Bowie.
2909520	2910520	All right.
2910520	2914520	Spencer Crittendenzenfren.
2915520	2916520	We got a boogie, man.
2916520	2917520	We did it again.
2917520	2918520	We fucking harmed it.
2918520	2922520	I swear, you know, I guess the same number of people come every week,
2922520	2925520	but I just live in constant fear of everyone catching on
2925520	2927520	that this is just a big waste of their time.
2927520	2929520	I guess there's going to be a night when we walk in
2929520	2931520	and no one's going to show up.
2931520	2933520	There was a...
2933520	2936520	I don't want to get off on any tangents tonight.
2936520	2939520	That's so dumb that I forced that as to my catchphrase.
2939520	2940520	It wasn't originally.
2940520	2942520	I heard myself say it the eighth time and I thought it was funny.
2942520	2943520	Jack Benny.
2943520	2944520	Yeah.
2944520	2945520	There was a...
2945520	2946520	Rochester.
2946520	2948520	There was a documentary about chimps.
2948520	2949520	I don't know if I ever talked about that.
2949520	2951520	And they showed how chimps don't...
2951520	2954520	They don't really have cooperation in their spirit.
2954520	2957520	I mean, they do for problem solving, but only if the alpha male gets to eat.
2957520	2959520	And they put a board and they release these ropes.
2959520	2962520	And then the alpha male comes in and he pulls one side of the board
2962520	2964520	and he notices the rope will go all the way through the other side of the board.
2964520	2967520	So he'll unlock the fence that contains the beta males
2967520	2970520	and they'll come in and help them pull the board together.
2970520	2971520	And then they all get to share the food.
2971520	2975520	But if they only put food in the middle of the board,
2975520	2976520	the alpha male eat it all.
2976520	2978520	And then after that, the beta male...
2978520	2980520	When the alpha male opens the door and says,
2980520	2981520	hey, come on, help me move the food.
2981520	2983520	The beta male will go, fuck you.
2983520	2984520	Not helping.
2984520	2985520	You're a dick.
2985520	2986520	You're a chimp.
2986520	2987520	I'm a chimp.
2987520	2988520	Fuck you.
2988520	2991520	Dan, that's not fair.
2991520	2996520	And what we've learned from Labyrinth is life's not fair.
2996520	2997520	I don't know.
2997520	2999520	Ticket prices aren't fair.
3000520	3005520	Anyways, I live in fear of the audience learning that lesson.
3005520	3007520	They're going to come and they're going to go,
3007520	3009520	$10 for harm in town, please.
3009520	3011520	Write this away.
3011520	3012520	Sit down.
3012520	3014520	What are you doing here on a Monday night?
3014520	3015520	I don't know.
3015520	3017520	I've got to fucking finish my thesis tomorrow.
3017520	3024520	I'm writing about contemporary racism and something.
3024520	3025520	It's important.
3025520	3027520	I'm going to be somebody.
3027520	3030520	But I just don't want to miss anything important tonight.
3030520	3033520	Ladies and gentlemen, it's Hymantown.
3033520	3034520	Welcome to Dan Hymantown.
3034520	3035520	Hey.
3035520	3036520	Fat.
3036520	3041520	I masturbate all over everything.
3041520	3044520	I'm drunk again.
3044520	3046520	I'm so sorry for myself.
3046520	3047520	I hate myself.
3047520	3049520	You should give me a high five for that.
3049520	3051520	I'm going to take a shit on stage.
3051520	3052520	It's makeup.
3052520	3053520	My face smells like shit.
3053520	3056520	Good night.
3056520	3059520	Off on a broomstick through the roof.
3059520	3060520	Huh.
3060520	3063520	Well, that only took two hours.
3063520	3067520	Time to drive home to Reseda.
3067520	3071520	Does anybody have anything pressing tonight they have to get back to?
3071520	3072520	Wait, wait, wait.
3072520	3073520	You?
3073520	3084520	I have to draw animals with given clothes.
3084520	3087520	That's the best audience in the world.
3087520	3090520	We have to repeat it.
3090520	3093520	He said, I got dot, dot, dot.
3093520	3097520	I have to draw animals in human clothes.
3097520	3101520	And he lilted up at the end, like it was a question, in human clothes,
3101520	3106520	kind of like a valley affectation, but also kind of like, you know what I mean.
3106520	3108520	Half of you are animators.
3108520	3110520	Sometimes you're working in that department.
3110520	3112520	We all have different animals in human clothes that we have to draw.
3112520	3114520	Is that your stumbling block?
3114520	3122520	Is the human clothes on the animals that's throwing you?
3122520	3125520	Also, is there a difference between human clothes and animal clothes?
3125520	3127520	In human clothes?
3127520	3128520	Scale.
3128520	3131520	So you're saying like you have to draw a bat,
3131520	3133520	but he's swimming in a t-shirt?
3133520	3136520	If we're going to interrogate him, he has to come up.
3136520	3138520	The audience isn't miked.
3138520	3139520	How about this?
3139520	3140520	Can you come up?
3140520	3142520	Can we incorporate him into our D&D,
3142520	3145520	do a quick D&D thing and make him an ancillary character?
3145520	3149520	Yeah, so that way, if life works the way movies work,
3149520	3152520	then tonight your pen is going to be alive.
3152520	3157520	Because you're like, somehow there were animals in human clothes in the game
3157520	3159520	and then come on up.
3159520	3160520	Spirit.
3160520	3161520	What's your name, sir?
3161520	3162520	Oh, Michael.
3162520	3164520	I'm here because of Spencer.
3164520	3165520	Oh, no shit.
3165520	3167520	Well, that's a nice segue.
3167520	3169520	Welcome to Spencer, our dungeon master.
3169520	3176520	Spencer, get us up to date.
3176520	3180520	Last time on Dragon Ball Z.
3180520	3184520	After swiftly and cleverly infiltrating Darkstar's stronghold,
3184520	3187520	Sharpie and the gang were faced with a sinister staircase.
3187520	3190520	Writing the confidence of their second level,
3190520	3193520	they charged the stairs and into the Darkstar's clutches.
3193520	3196520	Little did the Dark Lord know that they would be facing
3196520	3199520	the newly acquired powers of our heroes.
3199520	3201520	After a dramatic showdown,
3201520	3204520	Admiral Darkstar reverted to a demonic form
3204520	3207520	and escaped from another dimension to another dimension.
3207520	3211520	There they stood in the ziggurat with Karen Broadleaf,
3211520	3214520	a prisoner and member of the Butz-a-Lot tribe.
3214520	3217520	Well, that's right.
3217520	3223520	We met a girl who's from my tribe back in the realm of Butz.
3224520	3225520	All right.
3225520	3226520	All right.
3226520	3229520	Character sheets dispensed?
3229520	3231520	Dispensered?
3236520	3240520	If nothing else, we've found our new theme music for our D&D.
3240520	3242520	Certainly for character dispensation.
3242520	3243520	Thank you.
3243520	3247520	The character sheets are being dispensed right now.
3247520	3249520	These characters are level two.
3249520	3250520	They've leveled up.
3250520	3252520	They are now level two.
3253520	3255520	Dan, don't defy me.
3256520	3262520	Sharpie Butz-a-Lot, you've come so far in your adventures.
3263520	3265520	I feel so deceived.
3267520	3270520	Deception is like soup, Sarah.
3270520	3272520	It happens every day.
3273520	3274520	But I hate soup.
3274520	3276520	Then you'll have to have a fork.
3277520	3278520	Wait!
3278520	3281520	He wants me to eat soup with a fork.
3283520	3286520	A fork is just a spoon with slops in it, Sarah.
3288520	3290520	It doesn't matter now.
3290520	3291520	Give me the baby.
3291520	3293520	The baby or you?
3295520	3296520	You're bad people.
3296520	3299520	You want my Bowie Bowl.
3300520	3303520	Filled with such charms.
3303520	3305520	You guys keep on speaking in metaphor.
3305520	3309520	Take care of the baby, Bowie Bowl.
3309520	3313520	Deep in your arms, babe.
3313520	3315520	I examine my surroundings.
3316520	3319520	You're standing in the second floor of the dark ziggurat.
3319520	3325520	As you look, you notice that the green emerald dagger you held in your hand not moments before
3325520	3327520	is now floating in the air, spinning slowly.
3327520	3328520	Oh, shit.
3328520	3330520	It's emanating a green energy.
3330520	3334520	Energy that feels natural as if it's from the forest itself.
3335520	3340520	The ziggurat shatters and begins to crumble with you inside.
3340520	3341520	Whoa!
3341520	3342520	Yeah, magic flight.
3342520	3343520	Let's get out of here.
3343520	3344520	That's not a spell.
3344520	3346520	That's a Joseph Campbell term.
3347520	3349520	Do we take that dagger or no?
3349520	3351520	Well, yeah, it's floating.
3351520	3352520	I mean, it's yours.
3352520	3353520	I grab the dagger.
3353520	3356520	You grab the dagger and it shines with a great green light.
3356520	3358520	A burst of energy is released throughout the forest.
3358520	3360520	Yes, I love energy.
3361520	3363520	Do you continue fleeing?
3364520	3366520	I have a green dagger, you know, Sharpie.
3367520	3369520	Don't defy me.
3370520	3372520	Oh, you can forget about the dagger.
3374520	3376520	Yeah, yeah, we flee.
3376520	3377520	We flee.
3377520	3378520	You manage...
3378520	3380520	Well, let's roll, actually.
3380520	3381520	Uh-oh.
3381520	3383520	Forget about that part.
3385520	3387520	You manage to escape the ziggurat.
3387520	3389520	You stumble and fall.
3390520	3392520	But catch yourself.
3393520	3396520	I do one of those moves where you kind of dust yourself off.
3397520	3400520	It looks like you meant it the whole time.
3403520	3408520	You escape the crumbling ruin as it tumbles block by block to the floor.
3409520	3410520	It is destroyed.
3410520	3411520	Can I...
3411520	3415520	I mean, I don't want to get greedy, but I didn't look back.
3415520	3416520	I never looked back.
3416520	3421520	I fell out the door and I kind of stumbled and I dusted myself off and I just didn't look back.
3421520	3422520	And I just...
3422520	3425520	Like a good bowler, like turning away from a strike.
3425520	3427520	As well you shouldn't have.
3428520	3430520	It was a strong move.
3430520	3432520	Is there a path ahead of us?
3432520	3435520	There is a path out of the forest.
3436520	3438520	I range the path.
3439520	3441520	The path heads to the south.
3442520	3445520	Is that back to, uh...
3445520	3447520	Havensgard?
3447520	3448520	The town you were in before?
3448520	3449520	Yeah.
3449520	3450520	That's actually towards the north.
3450520	3451520	Oh, okay.
3451520	3452520	Well, let's go south then.
3452520	3454520	Let's strike out the new territory.
3454520	3455520	Let's clutter this map up.
3455520	3457520	What was the guy's name on stage again?
3457520	3458520	Michael.
3458520	3459520	Michael.
3459520	3461520	I wonder if we're going to run into some weirdo on the way.
3462520	3463520	I don't know.
3463520	3465520	Yeah, if there's any way...
3468520	3470520	We got no business back in that town, right?
3470520	3471520	Thornvale?
3471520	3472520	That's what it was called, right?
3472520	3473520	That's true.
3473520	3474520	You don't have any business.
3474520	3475520	To the south, I say.
3475520	3476520	The south.
3476520	3477520	Adventure.
3477520	3479520	Karen Broadleaf chimes in.
3479520	3482520	Our war camp is not far from here.
3482520	3483520	Ah, you know what?
3483520	3486520	I said something a couple adventures ago
3486520	3489520	in a blackout drunk
3489520	3493520	about going to find my father and talking to him.
3493520	3495520	Very true.
3495520	3496520	Hey, Karen.
3496520	3497520	Karen?
3497520	3498520	Karen.
3498520	3499520	Karen Broadleaf?
3499520	3501520	Karen Broadleaf.
3501520	3503520	Karen Broadleaf.
3503520	3504520	Karen Broadleaf.
3504520	3506520	No, no, Karen Broadleaf.
3506520	3508520	Karen Broadleaf.
3508520	3509520	Yes.
3509520	3511520	How can I help you?
3511520	3513520	No, Sharpie.
3513520	3515520	It's pronounced Karen Broadleaf.
3515520	3517520	Karen Broadleaf.
3517520	3518520	It's a subtle dialect.
3518520	3519520	Karen Broadleaf.
3520520	3521520	Hi.
3521520	3522520	Let's go back to your camp.
3522520	3523520	Take us to your camp.
3523520	3525520	Don't you mean your camp,
3525520	3528520	for Lord Butzalot, does own it?
3528520	3529520	Hmm.
3529520	3531520	Is my dad there?
3531520	3532520	He should be.
3532520	3534520	Although I admit I have been a prisoner
3534520	3537520	and I don't know what's happened recently.
3537520	3538520	Oh, right.
3538520	3539520	All right.
3539520	3540520	Well, lead the way.
3540520	3543520	You'll be much rewarded for aiding
3543520	3547520	the prodigal son on his gestalt.
3549520	3553520	I don't think you know what that word means, man.
3553520	3554520	A four-day march?
3554520	3555520	Yeah.
3555520	3556520	Well, okay.
3557520	3560520	Can we just kind of Tivo through that time?
3560520	3563520	Three days pass uneventfully.
3563520	3564520	Wow.
3564520	3565520	Okay.
3565520	3568520	It is before dawn on the fourth day.
3568520	3570520	You are sleeping.
3570520	3572520	I'm rolling perception checks.
3572520	3574520	I guess they're listen checks, my bad.
3576520	3578520	Mulrane, your ears perk up
3578520	3580520	and you wake out of your trance.
3580520	3582520	You don't sleep.
3582520	3583520	Oh.
3584520	3587520	Aren't you a dude?
3587520	3589520	It's my waking noise.
3591520	3592520	I'm awake.
3592520	3594520	You hear wolf-like howls off in the distance
3594520	3597520	in a high-pitched raspy cackling.
3597520	3598520	Come on, Michael.
3598520	3600520	Not soon after you hear the pounding
3600520	3602520	of feet in the grass.
3604520	3606520	Soon you'll be surrounded.
3606520	3607520	Sharpie.
3609520	3610520	Wake.
3610520	3611520	Wake.
3617520	3619520	I heard noises in the night,
3619520	3621520	stumps coming this way.
3621520	3622520	All right.
3622520	3623520	Unwrap from each other.
3623520	3624520	I'm the leader.
3624520	3625520	Everybody hide.
3628520	3629520	Quirk, wake up.
3632520	3633520	Hide.
3633520	3634520	There's people coming.
3634520	3636520	I had a terrible dream last night.
3637520	3640520	I had a dream I was holding three balls.
3640520	3643520	I was swirling them around in a circle.
3643520	3645520	But dreams aren't real.
3646520	3648520	I just want my brother back.
3648520	3650520	The house is a monster.
3656520	3657520	It's Strahb's idea.
3660520	3661520	I don't like that movie.
3661520	3662520	No, I know.
3663520	3667520	I examined the oncoming threat.
3667520	3669520	You don't see anything.
3669520	3670520	Well, then fuck it.
3672520	3674520	I stopped examining it.
3674520	3677520	You stopped successfully.
3677520	3682520	Use your half-elf powers to see the threat
3682520	3686520	and let us know what it is.
3686520	3691520	I use my half-elf powers to see the threat.
3691520	3694520	Using your elf eyes, you managed to make out
3694520	3697520	four or five pairs of legs between the bushes.
3697520	3701520	They seem very close and they've been watching you.
3701520	3702520	The legs?
3702520	3703520	The legs.
3705520	3706520	Bad news.
3708520	3709520	There are legs.
3709520	3711520	They appear to be close and they're covered in eyes.
3716520	3717520	All right.
3718520	3721520	Just because we leveled up, bear with me.
3721520	3725520	Do I have any spells so that I don't waste anybody's time?
3725520	3727520	You can make an edit point here, but I'm just wondering,
3727520	3732520	since we leveled up, do I have a spell that might possibly
3732520	3735520	make my voice sound really intimidating?
3736520	3738520	Do you have a ghost sound on there?
3738520	3739520	I'm not sure.
3739520	3740520	No.
3740520	3741520	I guess you don't have it.
3742520	3744520	All right, well, I'm just going to...
3747520	3749520	Hey, man, what do you want?
3750520	3753520	Putting on your best intimidating voice,
3753520	3756520	you attempt to call out the enemies in the darkness.
3759520	3761520	Your attempt sours.
3761520	3764520	They cackle at your pitiful attempt to frighten them
3764520	3766520	and ask what they want.
3769520	3771520	That was the cutest cackle.
3771520	3772520	You keep cackling.
3773520	3776520	What does my hat of disguise do?
3777520	3778520	You don't know yet.
3779520	3781520	I put on my hat of disguise.
3781520	3784520	You feel as if you could become disguised as something.
3784520	3791520	I disguise myself as I covered legs in a bush.
3791520	3793520	You fail to disguise.
3793520	3794520	God damn it.
3794520	3798520	You can only disguise yourself as a humanoid form.
3798520	3801520	I disguise myself as something closely resembling
3801520	3804520	the humanoids I see in the bushes.
3804520	3806520	You didn't see any humanoids in bushes.
3810520	3813520	I produce my tangle foot bag.
3813520	3815520	You produce your tangle foot bag.
3816520	3818520	I show everybody.
3820520	3822520	It's a nice looking tangle foot bag.
3822520	3823520	Thank you.
3823520	3826520	I throw my TFB at the bush.
3826520	3832520	Throwing your TFB towards the legs.
3832520	3835520	It strikes against the floor before exploding.
3835520	3839520	Tendrils of goo burst forth, wrapping the legs tightly.
3839520	3841520	The creatures are bound.
3841520	3847520	I take my big rage sword and go into a rage
3847520	3850520	and attack with my sword of rage.
3851520	3854520	Charging yourself up in an angry rage
3854520	3856520	and drawing your weapon in one fluid motion.
3856520	3859520	You charge through the bushes at the unknown foes.
3859520	3862520	You strike at the first one you manage to see.
3864520	3868520	You hit it, slicing right in the shoulder.
3868520	3871520	You hit what appears to be a large hyena.
3871520	3873520	It's standing on two legs.
3873520	3876520	You know this foul beast to be a knoll.
3876520	3881520	Matted fur covers its hide and it holds a large axe.
3881520	3883520	And it's wearing clothes, right?
3883520	3885520	It's wearing some clothes.
3885520	3887520	A nice sweater.
3887520	3889520	Human ones.
3890520	3892520	Really feel this, Michael.
3892520	3894520	I don't know what I'm doing up here.
3894520	3895520	You're doing great.
3895520	3897520	No, I'm just saying, let it sink in.
3897520	3899520	See those animals with clothes.
3899520	3901520	This is the work you'd have to do at home.
3902520	3906520	Become the knoll that I just struck in the shoulder.
3906520	3911520	Put yourself, become the human clothing clad animal.
3911520	3913520	I'll make sure there's some rips in it or something.
3913520	3915520	Just for you guys.
3917520	3920520	You hit him for 15 damage and he dies.
3922520	3924520	Michael, everybody.
3924520	3925520	Thank you, Michael.
3925520	3927520	Get to work.
3927520	3929520	You got work to do.
3931520	3933520	Summon monster.
3933520	3934520	Which monster?
3934520	3935520	The orangutan.
3935520	3938520	You summon the spectral orangutan.
3938520	3940520	It shimmers into being.
3941520	3943520	It awaits your command.
3943520	3944520	Orangutan.
3947520	3948520	Orangutan.
3948520	3949520	That's more of a gesture.
3949520	3950520	Orangutan.
3950520	3951520	Orangutan.
3951520	3952520	Orangutan.
3952520	3955520	The orangutan leaps into action.
3956520	3959520	It manages to bite the ear of a knoll,
3959520	3965520	dealing but one damage to the ear of the knoll.
3966520	3969520	He leaps back in pain and draws his sword,
3969520	3973520	charging right at the raging barbarian.
3975520	3978520	He strikes a mean blow with his axe.
3978520	3979520	At me?
3979520	3980520	At you.
3980520	3982520	But you manage to dodge.
3982520	3983520	Yeah.
3984520	3986520	I produce my bow and arrow.
3986520	3989520	Drawing your bow and arrow swiftly, you knock an arrow.
3989520	3991520	Does that mean I shoot it?
3991520	3993520	It means you pull it back as if...
3993520	3995520	Well, and then I knock another arrow.
3995520	3997520	And then you knock another arrow.
3997520	3999520	And then I shoot those arrows at the bush.
3999520	4002520	I must remind you that shooting two arrows at once
4002520	4003520	does cause a penalty.
4003520	4004520	Yes.
4004520	4007520	I saw the little post-it that you left on my paper.
4008520	4011520	He's like your passive-aggressive roommate.
4012520	4014520	You can shoot two arrows at a few minutes.
4014520	4015520	Mustard dries.
4018520	4020520	When the cap's not on.
4020520	4022520	Mustard dries.
4023520	4025520	One of your arrows hits its mark,
4025520	4029520	and the other flies aside and plants itself into a tree.
4029520	4033520	And grows an arrow tree on the side of that tree.
4033520	4036520	You deal nine damage to his stomach.
4036520	4039520	He recoils in pain but is not dead yet.
4040520	4042520	Ghost sound, press digitization.
4042520	4044520	Dancing lights!
4044520	4045520	Dancing lights!
4045520	4046520	Oh boy, that doesn't...
4046520	4048520	That does not sound...
4048520	4052520	No word in that description sounds dangerous.
4052520	4055520	I cast dancing lights or whatever the hell.
4055520	4058520	You summon a personal illusion of your choosing.
4058520	4060520	But small and miniscule.
4063520	4064520	Right?
4064520	4065520	Yeah.
4065520	4067520	So I got some lights going on?
4067520	4069520	If you want, describe it.
4069520	4072520	If you had magical light-emitting powers, what would you do?
4072520	4075520	I have dazzling lights that bewilder the eyeballs
4075520	4078520	on the legs of the bush creatures.
4078520	4080520	And they're disoriented,
4080520	4082520	diminishing their power to attack us.
4082520	4085520	They are a bit dazed, it's true.
4085520	4087520	Sharpie, do something.
4087520	4090520	Ray of frost!
4090520	4093520	N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N- Bonk!
4093520	4095520	Ray of frost!
4095520	4097520	Ray of frost!
4097520	4100520	I cast ray of frost.
4100520	4102520	Casting ray of frost.
4102520	4105520	A ray of frost emits from your hands.
4105520	4108520	It manages to strike the wounded Knoll,
4108520	4109520	freezing him over.
4109520	4111520	He falls to the ground and shatters.
4111520	4112520	Whoo!
4112520	4113520	How many more are there?
4113520	4115520	There's but two more.
4115520	4118520	Um, the shattered Knoll, anyone?
4118520	4121520	The days Knolls attack you.
4121520	4122520	What?
4122520	4125520	They're dazed from the illusions.
4125520	4127520	They manage to not hit anything.
4127520	4129520	They bump into each other comically.
4129520	4131520	You guys laughed at dancing lights.
4131520	4133520	You guys laughed at dancing lights.
4133520	4134520	Look.
4134520	4136520	I shoot two arrows.
4137520	4140520	You managed to shoot two arrows.
4140520	4143520	One of them flies right into the ground.
4143520	4146520	You don't know how it even did that.
4146520	4149520	The other hits the Knoll right in the eye.
4149520	4151520	I mean, did you see that in a movie or something?
4151520	4154520	You gotta practice that more before you-
4154520	4155520	Shooting two arrows?
4155520	4156520	Yeah.
4156520	4157520	Like, when has it ever hit two things?
4157520	4158520	Robin Hood.
4158520	4159520	No, not you!
4159520	4160520	You!
4160520	4163520	When have you ever hit two things with two arrows?
4163520	4166520	Well, dear friend, there was one night
4166520	4168520	when I sat out in my yard all night
4168520	4170520	and I said, we're going to shoot the two arrows
4170520	4173520	for hours and hours until I can shoot these two trees.
4173520	4176520	And it didn't happen, but I got very close.
4176520	4177520	Ha ha!
4177520	4178520	Life is an adventure!
4178520	4180520	Take chances!
4180520	4182520	I throw my-
4182520	4184520	How many knives am I allowed to throw?
4184520	4186520	You can throw one at a time.
4186520	4188520	I'll throw one knife at a time.
4188520	4191520	Whatever increases my accuracy.
4191520	4193520	Pulling a knife from your pack.
4193520	4196520	You throw it at a Knoll!
4196520	4197520	You miss.
4197520	4198520	Shit!
4198520	4199520	I throw another one!
4199520	4200520	No, it's not my turn.
4200520	4201520	It's not, yeah.
4201520	4202520	Eh, fuck it.
4203520	4204520	All right.
4204520	4205520	Is it me?
4205520	4206520	Yeah, go.
4206520	4207520	All right.
4207520	4208520	Hypnotism.
4208520	4209520	Hypnotism.
4209520	4210520	On one of them.
4210520	4212520	You can do it on multiple.
4212520	4213520	Oh.
4213520	4214520	It fascinates them and makes you-
4214520	4217520	Makes them, like, in a dazed stupor.
4217520	4221520	They're entitled to saves, of course.
4221520	4223520	They manage to fail their saves.
4223520	4224520	Nice, nice.
4224520	4229520	They're fascinated by your stunning mesmerizing movements.
4229520	4233520	Perhaps the subtle swaying of your hips.
4233520	4236520	Perhaps.
4236520	4239520	The subtle swaying.
4239520	4240520	Sharpie's a very good dancer.
4240520	4241520	Of your hips.
4241520	4242520	Gentlemen.
4242520	4245520	Gentle Knolls.
4245520	4246520	Do I have their attention?
4246520	4247520	Are they listening to me?
4247520	4250520	They are wrapped.
4250520	4256520	You'll notice your feet are stuck by our tangling bushes.
4256520	4258520	And dazzled by my dancing lights.
4258520	4265520	You'll see the two of your friends have already moved beyond into a place I call Butcelotia.
4265520	4267520	Also, there are arrows on the ground.
4267520	4269520	Feel free to take them.
4269520	4274520	They are our gifts to you.
4275520	4288520	The first of you to kill the other will join me forever by my side as my faithful companion.
4288520	4303520	The other will go straight to a place where your face will be fitted with a custom-sized wooden box full of spiders.
4303520	4309520	As you are instructing them to do a very odd task, they're entitled to a second save.
4309520	4311520	Which they fail.
4311520	4314520	They fight to the death in front of you.
4314520	4315520	I turn my back.
4315520	4318520	I do the same thing as I did on the collapsing cigarette.
4318520	4320520	I just walk away dusting my shoulders off.
4320520	4324520	I don't even know if I had more dust, but I just walk away.
4324520	4328520	You hear the noises of Knolls ripping each other apart.
4328520	4330520	I just look at a tree.
4330520	4332520	Is that deciduous?
4332520	4335520	It's evergreen.
4335520	4338520	It's a beautiful forest.
4342520	4343520	What happened?
4343520	4345520	Well, I guess you guys are looking, huh?
4345520	4346520	He's the only one not looking.
4346520	4349520	I watch the fight and see what's the outcome.
4349520	4357520	The smaller scrappier Knoll managed to rip the throat out of the other one right before having his eyes gouged out by the still-beating heart of the dead thing.
4358520	4360520	A Heath Ledgerton.
4360520	4364520	Now, do I honor your agreement with him or should I go kill the other one?
4364520	4365520	Oh, no.
4365520	4367520	When he wakes up, he's going to try to kill us.
4367520	4368520	Okay.
4368520	4370520	I attack with flaming sword.
4370520	4373520	You attack with flaming sword.
4373520	4376520	You strike the Knoll.
4376520	4378520	In the chest.
4378520	4380520	Don't make it sound so minimal.
4380520	4381520	In the chest!
4381520	4383520	Yeah, the heart's in there.
4383520	4385520	Right, it is abdominal.
4385520	4386520	Knolls are like people, right?
4386520	4388520	The vitals are in the chest, right?
4388520	4390520	It's a great place to hit someone.
4390520	4391520	Usually.
4391520	4393520	I shoot one arrow.
4393520	4400520	As you strike the corpse with your sword, so too an arrow flies.
4400520	4402520	The arrow flies and misses.
4402520	4405520	That's your arc is learning to shoot one arrow.
4405520	4406520	That's your character arc.
4406520	4408520	Are all the Knolls dead now?
4408520	4410520	All the Knolls are dead now.
4410520	4411520	We did it!
4411520	4413520	Yay!
4413520	4415520	Thank you, thank you.
4417520	4420520	Now what?
4420520	4422520	Loot their bodies.
4422520	4423520	Huh?
4423520	4424520	Loot their bodies.
4424520	4427520	I rummage through the remains of the dead Knolls.
4427520	4430520	You only managed to find a few coins.
4430520	4432520	You made that sound sexy.
4432520	4434520	You made getting hit in the chest sound like nothing.
4434520	4437520	You only managed to find a few coins.
4437520	4441520	I don't know what sexy is, you guys.
4441520	4447520	We should pause our campaign there and give Spencer his due in applause for him.
4447520	4451520	Spencer!
4451520	4456520	And now we should enter that vital chapter of our show where we try to figure out how to end the show.
4456520	4459520	Alright, clearly, let's hear it for Erin McGathey.
4459520	4461520	Thank you.
4461520	4463520	Erin McGathey.
4463520	4465520	Little baby.
4466520	4476520	Dan, you asked me on the way here to, on the fly, download the karaoke version of Magic Dance from Labyrinth.
4476520	4477520	Yes.
4477520	4482520	Do you feel that now, after what we've gone through, after our investigation of the film,
4482520	4487520	you're immersion into the character of Jareth without any help but...
4487520	4490520	No, because we opened the show with that song and I couldn't fucking do it.
4490520	4493520	Yeah, but you had the assistance of the actual lyrics there.
4493520	4495520	Do you think now that you've got...
4495520	4499520	I mean, that's certainly walking without a tightrope, without a net.
4503520	4505520	You remind me of the babe.
4505520	4507520	What babe?
4507520	4508520	You do.
4508520	4509520	I do what?
4509520	4510520	You do.
4510520	4511520	The babe.
4511520	4513520	You remind me of the babe.
4513520	4515520	Stop.
4515520	4519520	Some baby cries.
4519520	4521520	Yeah, we can cry.
4521520	4523520	What could he do?
4523520	4530520	He'll take my blub, baby cleft, left up, baby dry.
4530520	4533520	What could I do?
4533520	4537520	No one can tell my baby what to do.
4537520	4542520	Dances and fairies and magic coming through.
4542520	4547520	Everybody's lightning sucking on your shoe.
4547520	4549520	Dance, magic dance.
4549520	4551520	Jump, baby jump.
4551520	4553520	Jump, jump.
4553520	4556520	Jump, baby jump.
4556520	4558520	Labyrinth, baby labyrinth.
4558520	4562520	Baby labyrinth dance, magic dance.
4562520	4564520	Go through the dance.
4564520	4571520	I saw my baby going through a labyrinth.
4571520	4573520	What could I do?
4573520	4579520	She asked a caterpillar which way that she should go.
4579520	4582520	He said left.
4582520	4585520	Oh, go left.
4585520	4591520	What kind of world could make you try to go right?
4591520	4593520	A little labyrinth world.
4593520	4596520	Oh, what kind of...
4596520	4599520	Baby, where can you go to?
4599520	4607520	Magic world, magic dance.
4607520	4610520	Dance, magic dance.
4610520	4613520	World, magic world, magic dance.
4613520	4616520	Thank you for coming to Hermit Dance tonight, everybody.
4616520	4618520	Jump, diamond dance.
4618520	4621520	Thank you, Spencer, our dungeon master.
4621520	4622520	Magic jump.
4622520	4624520	Thank you to all the beautiful crew here at Meltdown.
4624520	4628520	Thank you, first and foremost, to all of you who are dressed up as Jareth tonight.
4628520	4632520	We're all going to go get fucked up as Jareth in the drawing room.
4632520	4636520	I want to thank Katie Levine, Zach McKeever, Emily Gordon, Daniel Kramer,
4636520	4639520	Justin Marshall, Mo Fathom, Jenny Pine.
4639520	4640520	Chug it.
4640520	4642520	How do you fucking say that name?
4642520	4643520	It doesn't matter.
4643520	4644520	I'm Jeff Davis.
4644520	4646520	Dan Harmon, your mayor, your goblin king.
4646520	4650520	Dance, Jim Henson, dance.
4650520	4653520	Dance, him, dance.
4653520	4655520	Jim Henson, dance.
4655520	4659520	Dance, magic dance, magic world.
4659520	4662520	Magic world.
4662520	4666520	At 13 o'clock, you'll be mine, little baby,
4666520	4670520	because of the rules I made up arbitrarily,
4670520	4674520	because you caused the whole thing to happen, like in Bugs Life,
4674520	4678520	which was also poorly structured
4679520	4685520	and equally revered by the weak-minded.
4685520	4688520	It was the goodwill hunting of bug movies.
4688520	4689520	Fuck you.
4689520	4690520	Fuck you.
4690520	4693520	Fuck you, audience.
4693520	4695520	Fuck you, audience.
4695520	4696520	Fuck you.
4696520	4699520	Don't forget Monster House is available on DVD.
4699520	4704520	Get it at any Albertsons next to the Wrigley Gum.
4704520	4706520	Oh, thank you, John Carpenter, for coming.
4706520	4708520	Thank you, John Carpenter.
4708520	4714520	I saw my baby with a dick as big as a stan's magic...
4714520	4715520	Wait.
4715520	4716520	Oh.
4716520	4717520	You...
4717520	4718520	Turn it around.
4718520	4725520	Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance,
4725520	4732520	magic dance, dueling boys, every muppet dance,
4732520	4735520	every muppet dance in the magic.
4736520	4741520	In the magic, dance, jurist dance,
4741520	4747520	all the jurist dance up on stage, the magic stage,
4747520	4753520	dance, muppet dance, dance, dance, muppet dance.
4753520	4754520	Oh, shit.
4754520	4755520	Oh.
4758520	4759520	All right.
4759520	4760520	You're not allowed to leave now.
4760520	4761520	This is going to get weird.
4761520	4762520	It's going to get freaky.
4762520	4764520	Dance, muppet dance.
4764520	4765520	Dance, muppet dance.
4765520	4767520	Everybody rub cod pieces.
4767520	4768520	Rub your cod pieces together, everybody.
4768520	4769520	Guys.
4769520	4770520	Come on.
4770520	4771520	I got it.
4771520	4772520	Cod piece bumps.
4772520	4773520	Cod piece grinds.
4775520	4777520	I don't care if you don't got one.
4777520	4781520	Here comes the funky rap bridge from Black Gareth, Jared.
4786520	4788520	Well, I was walking down the labyrinth street one day,
4788520	4790520	and I saw some characters saying, hey, hey, hey.
4790520	4791520	That wasn't him.
4791520	4792520	That was me.
4793520	4796520	He waved it off.
4797520	4798520	Another heroic move.
4800520	4801520	Dance, magic.
4801520	4802520	Magic, penis dance.
4802520	4804520	A special shout out to our only Black Jareth.
4804520	4808520	Maybe the only Black Jareth that anyone's ever known of.
4808520	4809520	Please post your pictures, everybody.
4809520	4810520	I want to see these tomorrow.
4810520	4811520	Thanks for coming.
