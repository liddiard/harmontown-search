0	10280	I just look behind me and, where the fuck are we?
10280	21040	Somewhere in the middle of outer space, or in the leafy groves of Long Island, New York.
21040	27880	From the fantabulous Cradle of Aviation Museum here in Long Island, Harbinetown is now in
27880	28880	session!
28880	40360	The international treasure, would you please welcome into the cosmos of your mind, the
40360	42560	Game Master, Spencer Crittenden.
42560	47000	Thank you, thank you.
47000	49560	What's up Spencer?
49560	58840	I don't know man, what's up with you?
58840	63560	Not too much, there's one other thing I forgot to mention, careening to the cosmic vapor
63560	70680	of invention that is the beautiful realm of dark matter and light matter, combined together
70680	74360	to stretch and expand your mind and space time itself.
74360	79560	Please put your hands together for the mayor of Harbinetown, Dan Harmon.
79560	101520	Hello, hello universe, hello Milky Way.
101520	106480	Thank you, thank you, there's one guy yelling out that I love.
106480	109360	Your weight loss worked!
109360	112160	I'm not insulting you, just repeating.
112160	119120	It's something that I need to hear after a couple days of pizza and stuff.
119120	123960	You did look thin, but then again, against the backdrop of all time and space.
123960	126800	Everybody looks thin against the cosmos.
126800	129720	Light is actually bending around Dan right now, it makes him look smaller.
129720	134240	Why do you think Neil deGrasse Tyson picked this line of work, I mean the guy's a little
134240	139280	thick in the caboose, he wants to stand next to quasars.
139280	147600	Yeah exactly, everybody's thin next to a horse head nebula.
147600	152960	Well thanks for coming, you guys have probably been at a convention all day today most of
152960	153960	you right?
153960	160200	And I think a lot of the folks here stood in line for a while, we're at the signing.
160200	161200	Too long.
162160	163160	Thank you so much.
163160	170280	We've got a house full of dedicated fans and for those who are listening to this later,
170280	175720	it's this virtually vertical raked planetarium that we're in.
175720	180880	It's like an IMAX except it's just three dudes.
180880	187040	It's a wall of people, the people in the second row are only a little bit behind the people
187040	190040	in the first row, they're mostly above them.
190040	194960	So it's sort of like you could climb their faces.
194960	198920	Is it possible to fire up the planetarium so we can have like the Pleiades and shit
198920	199920	behind this?
199920	206440	I mean I'm almost certain the answer is no but I just like, because behind this for the
206440	214800	listener that there is just this giant like yeah and empty void, it's pretty groovy.
214800	225120	Yeah I don't think, I don't think, I don't think a spontaneous nation.
225120	226120	You want a drink Dan?
226120	227120	Yeah.
227120	230920	Why don't you talk and I'll conjure up a cocktail for you.
230920	231920	Oh okay.
231920	232920	That's teamwork.
232920	235720	This is the partnership.
235720	241560	In the beginning as you know, there was nothing.
241560	247360	Which means there was no time, which means that there was infinite time, which means
247360	252200	there was a hundred percent chance of anything happening including a whole universe.
252200	257640	Which was spontaneously brought into existence in the form of a tiny particle, exactly the
257640	265040	density of infinity, which then exploded into everything and will one day either collapse
265040	274280	or suck back in on itself and in the meantime here we are for our brief few frames and
274280	281100	a very very high speed camera shot of an explosion that is lasting 80 trillion years.
281100	285960	And in that giant vast expanse of what we consider time, some of us have chosen to dress
285960	288960	like Deadpool for the evening.
288960	294520	That's how big this explosion is, is that a one, it's giving me Miami flashbacks though
295520	301840	I remember we were talking about Deadpool when someone leapt from the audience and punched.
301840	304240	I don't think this is that kind of crowd.
304240	309000	I think if you guys had reached the point of your psychosis I didn't think it was that
309000	315120	kind of crowd until like 20 people were like no no not at all that's not me.
315120	321400	Well there you come on these are these are planetarium folk they're they're they're they're
321400	326800	triggered by people behind desks questioning their sanity like that's the guidance counselors
326800	330800	and things like it the difference between being held back in third grade and being moved
330800	339760	up to sixth grade is like whether the principal's IQ is 90 or 95 right I my my mom often told
339760	343560	me the story she's like they wanted to hold you back in kindergarten like I had to go
343560	347680	and yell at the principal the principal was like he's like he can't walk on a balance
347680	354800	beam she's like he can read college textbooks he's like he can't use scissors what is he
354800	359440	gonna what is this like what is the society he's gonna enter where he's gonna like walk
359440	368000	down a log and and wrap everyone's Christmas gifts but but but an illiteracy would be fine
368000	372320	for that would like like you just put him in first grade he'll be fine how many balance
372320	377560	beams are waiting for him out there in the world I am pretty bad at balancing and using
377560	384880	scissors couldn't tie my shoes couldn't tell time very bad at math but yeah boy boy howdy
384880	396560	could I read just like you guys right do we got any literates in the house where my illiterates
396560	408920	at where's my dyslexia pretty evenly dispersed yeah almost exactly three three thirds I had
408920	415600	a forgive my energy I had I'm in Long Island so I had a Long Island iced tea at dinner and well
415600	422000	you actually did yeah for those who don't know how to make a Long Island iced tea you take a 16
422000	429800	year old in their parents kitchen well the parents are out of town you open the cupboard
429800	436800	and you pour whatever is in there because you don't want any of the bottles to reveal that you took
436800	442760	any of them so then you end up with a full cup of every liquor in the cabinet and that's a Long
442760	449320	Island iced tea I did yeah you take you tend to drink them when you're younger because you know
449320	453080	how to order them and sound it's like you can't get that words wrong no one's gonna go you're not
453080	461560	21 the way you said Long Island iced tea you must be a bachelorette one Long Island iced tea coming
461560	470640	up the Long Island of course is that not that long this is a Viking goes back to Viking times
470640	477560	people that didn't want the Vikings to find Long Island would tell them it's very Long Island you
477560	483560	can't miss it just of course hoping that the Vikings would end up in New Jersey which they did
483560	490000	I don't know anything and they had long boats yeah you think that that would have worked they just
490000	493400	got they're like are you sure we shouldn't be really precise in our aiming toward Long Island
493400	500560	no you don't just go wide it's a Long Island it's not that long it's just very crafty pre-Cambrian
500560	512200	Atlanteans that wanted to protect Long Island and its culture we're in Nassau County am I correct
512200	523280	yeah Nassau is a Native American word meaning rich white people that hurts people don't know that you
523280	526800	guys you guys came here for the fucking truth and you it's what that's what you're gonna get tonight
527160	539080	yeah I mean matter can't exist in the same place and you have privilege it's all same science yeah
539080	543920	truth is truth you can't just take the parts you like I thought you were joking look there was a lot
543920	549080	of emails to be deleted I thought you were joking at dinner about the Long Island iced tea I thought
549080	552400	you were just musing but you actually yeah because I talked about it so much I was like oh of course
552520	557040	Long Island iced tea is out of the menu and I was like oh Long Island iced teas and as I was explaining
557040	563680	how much I would never drink one again it's kind of made me nostalgic like you talk about a drink
563680	568440	long enough do they make them better here do you think did you think this is like I tasted like
568440	575800	the same kind of beverage that that I remember from 20 years ago I you know it's it's long yeah
575800	585360	I didn't finish it I'm gonna I'll have a pretty bad hangover tomorrow but I tried that man I I don't
585360	590080	want to be anticlimactic with it but because I was trying on the plane I was trying to write
590080	598600	a Long Island song but when we were in Boston Dan wrote a Boston song and it was it was listen to
598600	603060	the episode it was good it was a cappella but this time and I had like did you actually concoct
603060	621820	like yeah that's why I said like it's more of an emotional thing wait no wait long island
621820	632700	rest your weary face it's too long for too long now long island your outer space just a
632700	645500	song for Long Island Long Island be with me Long Island take a pee Long Island frolic in
645500	658780	costume while you wait in line Long Island how long will you wait to be a part of the country

674420	693100	that long at all winter spring summer fall give me a call new phone who dis some of that was some
693100	699900	of that I wrote just now who's up there on light effects because that was pretty special that was
699900	707980	like like the encore of a journey concert I want to plug I want to plug the app that I use there
707980	713140	because it's only seems fair but also I kind of don't want to because it feel like it's my secret
713140	719300	weapon with songwriting it's it's called cord bot it's a really good app like for if you if you if
719300	725340	you if you're not musically trained but you only know like oh I need cords and I need to know which
725340	732100	cords work together and you're just like it's a it's a cool cool app you can like quickly move
732100	736500	cords around and hear if they work together so was that whole song in that or did you like make
736500	741540	cords and then move them into garage banders that was just cord bot doing it's the you can be very
741540	747820	simple you can just play tones and you can it's got it's got enough sophistication what did you
747820	760140	make that sound cuz you're exhausted you just hate the lead programmer on garage band gonna be a
760140	765820	long day at work tomorrow what's this cord bot we're hearing about from the Long Island you had
765820	773620	one job last night keep harming on garage band it's just harder yeah I imagine garage band is
773620	778820	probably a lot easier for people that actually understand music but like I like garage band you
778820	784860	have to like poke and swipe and poop around in order to just say well what if this was a sharp
784860	797580	instead of a flat yeah that's a bad app I work at Apple I quit Dan I quit working for Dan I went
797580	802580	back to Apple let's see if I have any what if I you know what if I lost you and then I found you
802580	809140	there like I come into the Apple store and I'm like like they're like can we help you I'm like
809140	821340	yeah I have a broken friendship did you make an appointment yeah I thought I did but it turns out
821340	828140	maybe I just muscle through and they're like they're like security is coming and then you're
828140	846660	like it's alright it's fine he has an appointment at the emotional genius bar yeah let's see I'm
846660	857700	just looking for this is song fragments Long Island up and down Long Island come to town Long
857700	868500	Island singer song Long Island make your island long I remember when I was a kid I was briefly
868500	874060	living in Manhattan and I came in as a friend of mine lived somewhere in Nassau County and it was
874060	878820	4th of July and we had all these sparklers and like smoke bombs and like like kind of low-grade
878820	884420	fireworks and we went like the parents were doing their thing and getting drunk and making food and
884420	890660	stuff so me and my friend Luke they're not Luke David we were doesn't matter doesn't that you
890660	898060	don't fucking know them and we went there was a telephone pole and it was like giant ants were
898060	902260	like living inside it like there's a little there's a little fisheries and cracks inside old telephone
902260	906900	poles are kind of tarred and whatnot and there's a big ants living inside it moving around so we
906900	911980	started sticking smoke bonds in there and it's like all these ants would and so we thought that
911980	917660	was really fascinating and so we kept doing that just see like what ecosystem existed inside this
917660	924300	telephone pole and then it caught on fire so we caught a hole we cut a hole and it's made of tar
924300	929060	yeah it's got all that oil in it so the fire department had a real tough time on that one
930020	933540	because you guys are like well it's not a fire bob it's a smoke bob they're like how do you think
933540	942420	you make smoke there's fire in the bomb stuck it in a big piece of wood and ants yeah yeah that's
942420	946900	like how they used to really make fire before I think me and my friend we just hid in the bush
946900	952460	and took no credit for it cowardly yeah I told that I totally like me and my friend Dan Ramstack
952460	959940	like we made a when we were like like 10 years old we we took a we took batteries and light bulbs
959940	964860	and we like made this like blinky thing with electrical tape that we I don't think I don't
964860	968860	know if we wanted it to look like a bomb I really don't I think I think we wanted it to just look
968860	975340	like a crazy sci-fi thing and we like taped it to the screen door of a girl that lived in the
975340	980780	neighborhood that I guess that was our way of saying I love you we'd like to kiss you one day
982700	988220	here's a blinky uh device but and her father came to the door and called the bomb squad or
988220	993260	I got called the police and they called the bomb squad and they were like people everywhere
993260	1001260	flashlights and assault rifles and players and um and we just we just sat in a swing porch and watched
1002140	1008940	my mom was like did you guys know I mean like what are we supposed to do say yes like like
1008940	1013900	we're gonna get more than beaten we're gonna get shot like these people I didn't there wasn't our
1013900	1022300	idea that the johnny gov would get involved she just wanted a kiss um just wanted to just wanted
1022300	1030060	to uh call in the bomb threat of affection this was before me too it was a perfectly acceptable
1030060	1038540	way to call upon a young lady she planted a bomb on her father's door yes back in the late 70s early
1038540	1045500	80s nothing said will you be mine these days it's so complicated like are you supposed to use a
1045500	1051020	molotov cocktail or like what happened to romance the flashbang we used to we used to go I don't
1051020	1056460	know I want to do what the right thing is but I'm trying my best I just I don't know what what it is
1056460	1064460	anymore I'm sorry um I feel like we've talked about in the very early days of harmontown of
1064460	1068300	colonizing the moon I think this is the closest that we've gotten we're here in the planetarium
1068300	1071820	we were on the moon yeah
1076140	1080700	stars that's the problem the lights are washing out the planetarium can we can we kill the
1080700	1086540	sidelines and that'd be bad for bad for our subscribers oh that sounds like a distraction
1090940	1092060	we can't see up there

1276380	1282060	or playing basketball but turning into a wolf just seems like a path to growth yeah it seems

1372460	1376540	they're going to be in this human society's moral compass might be based on the complete
1377580	1383260	dispensability of human life yes well everybody's so afraid of getting into trouble and getting

1445100	1452380	don't it was like we i this is where it gets sketchy because it's like i don't know if okay
1453100	1457340	it's 9 11 9 11 i'm telling the story of dave booblets is 9 11
1460540	1467180	unless he grew up and became of a terrorist new york uh don't don't google investor i
1468620	1474060	but uh don't groan when after you shout out 9 11 in the middle of my story you people go
1474060	1480220	go get your moral compass uh so he's climbing up the thing and i don't know i can't i i think i
1480220	1486060	feel like when you're a kid and you you do fucked up things like you know you feel so guilty that i
1486060	1491980	think you can you whitewash you you i think you alter the memory because my memory of it is it
1491980	1498220	is a total accident like a wiley coyote rube goldberg thing but i have a feeling from what i know of
1498220	1505340	how evil children are that this was an intentional thing that we just didn't anticipate like having
1505340	1511500	the results that it did where there was like a two by four up there that was like just laying
1511500	1521420	and and there was an incline and as as dave booblets forehead crested the uh the threshold
1522700	1528300	coming up that this two by four in my memory just happened to choose that time to slide
1528860	1533980	like right for it but i that's i'm like let's be accountable and just even assume
1533980	1539660	let's black wash if that's the opposite of whitewashing this like history because like i i
1539660	1548860	bet somebody was like you know like like and this two by four slid and it and it and it hit dave
1548860	1554700	booblet squarely in the forehead and then i remember this like he he had this look on his face
1555260	1560620	and then i remember this tiniest little red dot on his forehead like immediately start getting
1560620	1566460	bigger and bigger and and then and then he like fell and and then and then started shrieking and
1566460	1575660	we all like clamber down out of the tree and and and and he's like ah ah uh stan goes into the house
1575660	1583260	he comes out with like a wad of paper towels um and he hands it to dave who like we're like eight
1583260	1589420	years old or something and dave like takes the paper towels and he touches them to his forehead
1590060	1598940	and then he pulls it back and he sees solid red paper towelling and he he just goes absolutely
1598940	1605740	insane and more so than he already had and and and he runs for his dirt bike and we all instinctively
1605740	1613180	just run for our dirt bikes with him and just like give him a ineffective police escort
1613180	1622860	to his home where he's just shrieking and there's like paper towels like trailing like he's just
1624540	1627500	and we're all just like blue angels like flanking him
1630300	1635900	just like like riding up the hill the calumet and then like get he goes screaming the entire
1635900	1641020	way so every every person weed whacking is stopping their weed whacking to see what's
1641020	1646060	going on he's just a kid with bloody paper towels like flying ahead of as he gets to his home
1646060	1652380	there's our little suburban front yards like he he you know you when you were a kid you you just
1652380	1657740	like ditch your bike he just he just like gets to the front yard ditches his bike and runs as his
1657740	1663900	mom comes out into the porch and and and into her arms with his bloody forehead and and and we all
1663900	1670540	just kind of like like just kept riding just we just we had one job just see him home safe
1671980	1679100	permission to buzz the tower so so you you did you weren't a part of the two by four you
1679100	1684460	well i look you probably were i don't i'm telling you they honestly got true somebody projected
1684460	1689580	this thing towards him like kicked it at him well what i'm telling you is my memory of it sincerely
1689580	1696860	is that the two by four just like moved like and i'm and i'm a 45 year old man going what is the
1696860	1701180	likelihood of that you know like like there was already that's a hat on a hat as we say in the
1701180	1706220	writer's room like like like like there was already a story happening here and like we were
1706220	1714380	we had malice uh toward this incursion and uh and so i just feel like whether whether we thought it
1714380	1718780	would you know like like we just i don't like like our physics are based on cartoons or something i
1718780	1724460	have a feeling that we were like well let's just do this as he comes up you know like like like i
1724460	1733180	i just it's my 45 year old like like you know cynical suspicion and also a little bit of like
1733180	1738860	middle-aged accountability like i'm going like how is how likely is it that that that my memory has
1738860	1744060	actually altered blade runner style to remove accountability because i i i've told the story of
1744060	1751260	this podcast too like we almost but i i i was like i i remember like like deciding to and
1751260	1758300	executing the strangulation of a friend who was like like like like he was putting on his scarf
1758300	1765420	we were like bundling up for winter and i was like i was probably six or seven like and i was
1765420	1771900	like to my friend said look carl is putting on his scarf let's go up and let's just like
1771900	1778620	you take one end and i'll take the other god what and you thought his head would get really
1778620	1783660	small and go through the knot like some kind of jerry i don't know i don't know i swear i don't
1783660	1789100	know i'd like i know that i wasn't thinking let's murder a human being i know that i wasn't thinking
1789100	1796060	that no i know i was thinking like like like like violence is fun like you know i said i was
1796140	1804940	thinking like like like he won't like it he'll hate it it'll be like like uh uh uh uh mahoney
1804940	1811580	on police academy screwing with the you know my mouser like like like this will be a real laugh
1811580	1815580	like he'll he'll he just certainly doesn't want his scarf much tighter than he's gonna make it at
1815580	1823100	his own and and and and my friend and i just would do is that it was my idea i pitched it he
1823100	1828860	yes sanded me we grabbed one end of the other started pulling and carl went like what are you
1832860	1842780	and and a teacher came by and he was he was fucking purple and and and and and you guys
1842780	1848540	are pulling as hard as you can that's my memory yes it's hard as hard as you can like not
1848540	1861340	understanding like anything about like help help and the teacher like why not funny the teacher
1861340	1865260	was we were young enough that the teacher was kind of omnipresent like there were no it was like it
1865260	1869340	was like we were we could have been like first grade i don't know how old you are in first grade
1869340	1875580	like what are you six uh yeah because it's always you're just out of kindergarten and it's like
1875660	1879980	you're like so the the teacher's like a mother duck and like all the ducks are kind of like
1879980	1886060	you know she's trying to so she was preoccupied for that sliver of time i mean jesus christ do
1886060	1892460	not leave kids alone i i or i shouldn't project don't leave me alone as a kid like i i maybe i'm
1892460	1897020	like i have a fucking so so i'm just kind of thinking like putting myself in this situation
1897020	1901900	i would i would i'm hoping this is what i would do this is what i would do is i would pull
1901900	1907500	and go oh what am i thinking and stop but it sounds like you guys were like kept going yeah
1909820	1915180	here's what i remember happening like is that the is that i remember the teacher coming over
1915740	1923580	and going like and this is the strangest thing uh that i i mean it's i'd have to like pull out
1923580	1928780	like an overhead of the coat room or wherever we were the foyer there's like kids in winter coats
1928780	1932540	everywhere they're all bundling up and putting on moon boots and half of them are crying and
1932540	1936780	then half of them are allergic to cheese and you want to get that there's just mass hysteria
1937500	1943580	you know and and so within this mass hysteria like three kids are are doing this like weird thing
1943580	1950700	and so i i just i think what happened is the teacher somehow wasn't conscious of the crime
1950700	1957260	that was taking place she was only conscious of carl dying she i think that's just how long his
1957260	1964460	scarf was that we were out of frame because it was milwaukee and maybe his mother lovingly
1964460	1969180	knit a very long doctor who scarfed for him and so we were just like i don't know it's just out of
1969180	1974860	the teacher's point of view and so she was only just like her shock the look on her face and the
1974860	1983340	tone of her voice i said carl and and that's what i and i was like oh and and i let go and she's like
1983980	1986780	carl like like like and she like loosened the thing and he's like
1988700	1995420	and couldn't speak so he couldn't say these two people over here just tried to murder me
1996940	2004380	take them to jail call the police like alter the course of his life did you did you just like like
2004380	2010780	like oh man what happened we carl are you okay we we oh yeah yeah yeah we stepped forward and
2010780	2017420	said allow me to introduce myself i feel somewhat responsible for this i see you're overwhelmed mrs
2017420	2024940	burr i i i i i i should stay here in fact no we fucking backed up and walked turned and walked
2024940	2030940	away and never spoke of it never spoke of it again and i don't i carl i i i did improv with
2030940	2037020	him in milwaukee later like when we were in high school and uh uh i was like do you remember me

2048700	2054060	was like a really cool funny guy like in high school long enough for him to forget he was like
2054060	2058540	as i like he ended up in comedy sports and he was like the funniest guy in his high school comedy
2058540	2063420	sports team and then like like and it was like really really like awesome dude that everybody
2063420	2068220	liked but he kind of had this personality that was like oh man all right he's kind of the michael
2068220	2073980	richards of his school and i i always thought like would you would you give him a partial stroke
2073980	2078620	yeah man like like did i did i just nudge him into comedy like you know like killing like a little
2078620	2084620	bit of like math or something i know i like i'll have to wonder forever but he forgave me the him

2300300	2306220	handle my situation without getting slut shamed is like uh basically you're like like i gotta i gotta
2306220	2311420	i gotta form a circular network where i don't piss anybody off and all this stuff and tommy
2311420	2317260	mcfeely's like how am i gonna bag whatever your name is which we will we will let have you you
2317260	2325500	leave you to your privacy i i my first uh like uh in kindergarten it was uh like nicole mccue and
2325500	2333340	and uh like that's actually that sounds like a a detective series she was a she was a she was
2333340	2337420	literally a little redhead girl like like charlie brown had his little redhead girl which i don't
2337420	2342540	think we ever saw but nicole mccue was so we would take attendance she always wore pantyhose and then
2343100	2346140	stop you're talking about uh talking about a kindergartner
2347500	2351340	there's just i don't expect you to know how to weave these highway cones but
2353100	2356860	you gotta keep it more wonder years than uh you
2361580	2367660	but i don't think i ever actually talked to her i i i what i remember is that during attendance
2368620	2374380	when my name was called she would look at me and giggle and when her name was called i would look
2374380	2380620	at her and giggle and so and i explained that to my mom and then she said oh you got a girlfriend
2380620	2387660	and i was like great that's one less thing to worry about i i i feel like i my memory is that
2387660	2392380	i just never fucked with it like i just like i'm not gonna go talk to her now i was just like i
2392380	2397340	got this this is great like uh every morning i get this i get this i get this partner i'm a
2397340	2404780	life partner and she has no idea did it ever no she did well she she probably doesn't remember
2404780	2413020	but she uh she but she had an idea we had it was it was a we were soulmates it was just bound to
2413020	2419580	morning roll call i think you're doing a little bit of rewriting history with a little bublitz
2419580	2425900	maybe two by four i think i think you were giggling i don't know why i'd make you know why
2425900	2430780	would i revise that though i'm a very self-loathing uh like like like why would i because it would be
2430780	2436540	such an unusual thing so it wasn't like it wasn't like i moved it would make sense that i made that
2436540	2441900	up if if the rest of the story was that i like stalked her kindergarten style and like wouldn't
2441900	2446380	leave her alone and stuff and the reason why i did that is because i was getting green lights uh
2446380	2452620	you know like i would make up the green lights yeah but but i and i i the way i remember it is
2452620	2459580	that it was the it was the perfect uh relationship right i never talked to her and uh sounds perfect
2460780	2465340	and there were yeah and i do i was i was aware of the fact that there were lots and lots of girls
2465340	2472060	that that that had no desire to giggle and smile hey it's okay it's all right it's fine it's not
2472060	2477180	your fault yeah you're happy it's not your fault you're happy now it's not your happy now man

3104380	3111820	orbit in predatory self-satisfied narcissism looking down at us like
3113900	3115420	manic depressive eagles
3115420	3123660	but you have a better perspective you're on your meds
3127340	3130780	and as your therapist told you you're getting your thoughts in order
3132140	3139660	and your roommate is a bitch so you're doing it in a bathroom at a hotel and that means you're
3139660	3147020	going to deal with other people that's fine you're patient you're a cosmic you embody the universe
3147900	3152220	your name is michael but your pronoun is they

3235740	3241580	e-minor's the wiping cord it goes okay goes like this from front to back
3243740	3247500	that was a crazy app can you that was kind of crazy that you weren't even looking behind you
3247500	3252060	but you were actually kind of right on like where we were in space well that may be due to maybe
3252060	3260700	rob are you in charge of the uh planets no just the sound okay so it was god and me working together
3260860	3262780	is this god is this god
3267580	3269340	do you want to do you want to play that clip
3269980	3277180	i see does anybody ever seen the movie zapped with scott mayo williams yeah there's a remake
3277180	3283180	of it yeah there is i guess i type zapped into youtube and there's a modern zapped but there's
3283180	3288700	also if you dig deep enough there's a 1980s zapped with an actor named scott bayo who will he games
3288700	3295580	actually so he's he's been famous lately for for not acting it's kind of a teen a teen tit
3295580	3299820	movie fantasy where a guy has telekinetic powers and he of course uses them to make girl shirts
3299820	3304940	fly off and stuff like that yeah but there's a scene where he gets beayed by these two frat boy
3304940	3309660	like jocks and they take their pants down they're mocking him in the back of a convertible hey you
3309660	3317660	weasel thanks for losing the tournament for us now get a load of this and then they flash him his
3317660	3326700	ass and then scott bayo uses the clip okay they pull their asses out they say kiss this
3326700	3331740	and then scott bayo looks at the two girls with anger and they telekinetically makes their boobs
3331740	3339180	pop out hashtag rape culture and then he he levitates so listen to this
3347660	3353180	god
3355420	3359980	they're hovering upside down with their with their asses hanging out and they put them up a tree
3359980	3366140	and they're like oh shit oh and one guy goes oh is this god and they keep saying it there's
3366140	3370300	but it's like the it's like the same clip you know like they they said is this god at some point
3370300	3377580	and so they just keep the editor it's confusing is this god is this god and the only thing that
3377580	3382540	makes the boobs it's like the boobs you're like oh jeez this isn't holding up to cultural shifts but
3383340	3389500	uh but but it kind of balances out because there's so much footage of these two men's asses
3391260	3396700	they're just like wiggling and jiggling they end up the film is sped up and they're just like
3396700	3406220	oh is this god is this god it's a odd thing to say i like yeah if you're if you're being
3406220	3410620	levitated with your friend and you're being put in a tree with your pants down that you instantly
3410620	3416540	go to a metaphysical place it's it's also a weird thing to subject like i'm sure the 12 year old
3416540	3421100	kids that are watching this movie when their parents are out of the room to see their first
3421100	3428140	pair of naked hairy men's assholes and just hearing the phrase is this god over and over again
3428140	3434620	like well they're well each like uh muscular rump is twitching over the trunk of a tree like
3435340	3440220	i'm sure some awakenings happened on both sides of this movie which is why it's kind of like
3440220	3446140	it balances like i'm sure there's a lot of uh you know uh yeah i don't know it's a very it's
3446140	3450940	a very strange film yes but the 80s were a strange time five years ago was a strange time
3451100	3456940	the rules they're changing fast changing fast so so much change yeah you can't even put a
3456940	3462700	bomb on a girl's door anymore it's crazy we're looking you know we're looking at behaviors that
3462700	3469580	were once allowable completely acceptable and normal and we're we're thinking about them now
3469580	3474060	doesn't even really matter what what uh it's the awareness is the important thing isn't that right
3474460	3479260	i believe so i think you have a song about that don't you i do wow
3481980	3487100	he said a women's sorry my thousand dollar phone doesn't recognize my thumbprint or me with my
3487100	3492380	glasses on it's a thousand dollars i can't really sing right now because my voice jam my
3492380	3496620	voice is a little shattered that's all right my phone can't turn on because i'm wearing glasses

3653500	3655660	71 years old fantastic
3658700	3662300	and you're proud of your son you're you're proud
3666140	3671980	now i'm 45 how does it feel to get to an age that gets applause that's got to be a little weird
3671980	3677980	threshold i i was recently i i just i just crossed a threshold where a waitress came to me i was
3677980	3685020	sitting by myself and i ordered a beer and she she said she said can i see some id
3691980	3697420	she's like no discriminating right and she was just like she's like 25 and she's just having
3697420	3701020	the time of her life she's just like that would be hilarious if i carded ian mckellen
3702620	3707340	like i i just realized she walked away and i was like wow i've yeah i mean i i don't really i
3707340	3715340	don't mind uh dying i i i i i i don't want to be 25 again i remember it was very very
3715340	3723580	the difficult and uh i'm i'm okay but it's it is just odd to walk like monitor these milestones
3723580	3731340	you set your age and then everyone applauded but the subtext was you made it your father's 96 wow
3731340	3734940	oh your your dad's still alive he's 96 that's he no applause for that shit
3738380	3743020	at 71 i'd be applauding that because he's like a genetic like he's carving the way for you
3743020	3750380	i i i my my my my my patriarchs kind of we don't know how biologically what their expiration date
3750380	3756300	is they tend to they tend to take themselves out with with with cigarettes and things not not with
3757100	3764060	not not hemmingway style i just mean they they they don't they they use the world around them
3764060	3768300	they don't they don't they don't just like sit there and like try to avoid dying they kind of
3768300	3775740	like oh that looks good i'm sorry i'm sorry what what oh okay go ahead dan we brought him into the
3775740	3781900	show i know i know i know i know sorry about your son dan doesn't have a son and neither does robin
3781900	3787420	neither is japan who do i yeah and he was directed towards us you guys are obviously
3787420	3793260	pretty close then yeah yeah that's cool you're right you and your son can go out well anthony
3793260	3800780	jr how old are you i'm in the 30s okay he's very trepidatious i'm sorry i didn't he's wearing
3800780	3810300	a dead full mask he's like i'm over 20 it's perfectly fine here you're fine here i think
3810380	3814140	no one's like he's in his 30s and he's dressed as deadpool at a convention
3814860	3820220	this is where we come to escape that kind of pressure that bartender that didn't affect you
3820220	3825500	she tore down my psyche if she made that joke yeah well i i mean she she affected me he said
3825500	3830460	that bartender would have uh torn down it didn't affect me i remembered it you know like we're all
3830460	3836140	yeah we all we all get we all get we all get hit all of our buttons get mashed at different times
3836780	3843580	i think the i think the objective is the is the the the uh you get this big keyboard of buttons
3843580	3848380	and like i think i think you want them all lit up before you die and like the ones that aren't lit
3848380	3853980	up yet the first time they get pushed they it's like jesus christ they go from not lit up to lit
3853980	3859500	up and it's a monumental event and sometimes that's traumatic it almost always is traumatic
3859500	3862940	how many of them are just eating your first chocolate bar there's like five of those
3862940	3867420	the rest of them are trauma-based and then you're like oh god that happened
3867420	3871820	but then then then people could just put beers down on those buttons they're already lit up
3871820	3879100	they don't toggle they don't go off it's called scarring uh and and i think i think the objective
3879100	3884540	is to like try to like you know get and i think to extend the metaphor i don't think you're able
3884540	3889180	to like really push most of them i think you're like most of those buttons are only accessible
3889180	3893500	because other people have to push them they have to do with other people didn't you carry around
3893500	3899740	like a towel like arthur dent for a long time yes when you were when you were younger yes i did
3900700	3905180	yes i was very into hitchhiker's guide and when i was uh so it's kind of like middle school
3905180	3910300	yeah dead pill little little little late to be so into something that you actually have a towel
3910300	3916860	that you carry around uh but i went to a public high junior high and there there wasn't a lot to
3916860	3929420	distract me from yeah i didn't dress like dr who i dressed as like my version of dr who uh-huh
3929420	3939500	like i had a a usa cap and i would wear four scarves cut off jeans two different pairs of shoes
3939500	3944620	four scarves yeah what do you mean two different pairs of shoes you mean one you mean you mean a
3944620	3948540	mismatched a mismatched like punky brewster yeah i would put them on my hands and feet
3949740	3954060	yeah i don't know and i thought i thought maybe they were a side by side and a hawaiian shirt
3954060	3960620	like a t-rex top for that would be goldberg uh thing yeah and uh and i would walk out i would
3960620	3966380	walk out of the i would go to i would walk home from school and my mom would meet me with this look
3969420	3974540	why are you so well lit are you the devil i don't know he's got this awesome he's got a he's holding
3974700	3980060	a bounce card or something he's about to like he's the he's the third act like of a horror movie that's
3980060	3986060	about to happen he's like the beginning of highlander when they push in during the wrestling
3986060	3993100	game like the wrestling game the wrestling game who here oh well let's continue this streak it's

4167580	4173020	tesla's to try to hide our bold spot by the way what's that you actually met my dad i met your dad
4173020	4177580	yeah he was the photographer he was photographer oh really yeah oh he's he was saying how excited
4177580	4182860	you were the the i i i got that impression that you weren't able to be here so because he was like
4182860	4187260	my daughter would be thrilled or whatever like he was taking pictures in there they're didn't sign it
4188940	4194060	he was the main guy taking pictures that's great yeah yeah i mean i so so so so you remember that
4194060	4200060	feeling of like like going to a convention and all of a sudden like it was like like oh like like
4200060	4204060	oh is it do you think it was more like the absence of the kinds of things you felt walking in the
4204060	4210540	halls of your school where you were like there's just like it's like this chiropractic ergonomic
4210540	4216940	like pressure like i can't do nothing right around here like i if i answer a question even
4216940	4221020	though i know the answer i know i'm gonna do it wrong i'm gonna get laughed at somehow or
4221020	4226300	there's just like everything is like jeez i you feel like you feel like it's a like the world is
4226300	4233500	covered in in half full glasses at this table and every gesture you make knocks three of them over
4233500	4238940	and you you desperately don't want to so then you start gesturing differently and then that's funny
4238940	4245340	and then you and then you go to for me it was gen con in milwaukee like uh uh which was the
4245740	4252300	there's just role-playing and based dnd and stuff but it was it was just like oh god to see grown
4252300	4259580	men and women wearing ridiculous armor and and and and and like and and like
4261980	4267340	actually so my mom my mom took me to stuff before that i think my mom knew she's like this kid
4267340	4273660	collects stickers he's like he's not going to be a football star and uh where is your
4274460	4279420	what's the state of your parents marriage like historically they're together i'm not trying to
4279420	4285500	pick up uh her mom they're they've been together the whole time yeah they've been together
4287420	4293100	they got married right before i was born so that's how it's usually supposed to work they have like
4293100	4300700	my brother was first my mom met my dad so okay how is it what's your mom's relationship with
4301100	4307020	nerd stuff um she goes to it every now and then just uh hold the stand
4309820	4313980	is that a is that a reference to the chuppa from a jewish wedding she says she's doing her part
4314700	4323420	hold the stand no she holds the stand for photography she literally holds the light stand
4324700	4329660	i thought it was like i heard like i heard hold the standard like like it's a battle like
4330300	4332540	if this man shall fall who will pick up the standard
4336140	4341500	but is your mom kind of like uh you know like and you let me know whenever i'm prying or whatever
4341500	4345900	i'm gonna like exploit a horrible deep-seated like personality conflicts within your family
4345900	4352060	unit and cause a breakup but uh is your so your dad's a nerd let's just put it that way
4352060	4361180	is your mom like uh not a nerd is she like she's i think she's like she watches
4361820	4366860	murder mystery shows so she's that type of nerd there's a good crossover there like true crime
4366860	4373180	stuff i find like i yeah like my girlfriend's not into sci-fi and fantasy necessarily she's
4373180	4378700	she's into what what you know me being happy but like at the same time like she's not gonna by
4378700	4387580	default want to watch a shitty like uh gilgerard is an astronaut in prison like i but we and i don't
4387580	4394700	want i don't like rom-coms but like we both like uh real life murder because it's sort of like as
4394700	4401580	extreme as normal life gets and i think i think that's why i like sci-fi is because it it heightens
4401580	4407180	everything it stains human relationships with iodine so because every story on star trek is
4407180	4414380	like well what what is good and what is evil it's like uh it's too nuanced in 27 dresses so
4414380	4420300	so like i'm not gonna taste every nook and cranny of what kate hudson's going through but like i
4420300	4425980	like i like a guy to go like there's an octopus monster on the poop deck of the star fleet and
4425980	4431260	he only tastes fear uh and he says you have a choice between killing someone you love and
4431260	4435820	powering your rocket boots and and and okay now i'm starting to now you can break this down into
4435820	4444140	rules and cope do you uh do you do you uh what's what grade are you in i'm going into 12th right
4444140	4449500	now oh wow so you're almost out yeah i'm finally almost out what are you gonna do what are you
4449500	4455420	interested in or do you hate that question i'm thinking of going for u.s history so oh nice
4456140	4463180	you're gonna be like a keeper like like you're gonna be the only person that knows we did this
4463180	4471180	before is there a certain period is there a certain era or time or place that you are most
4471180	4477820	fascinated with i'm pretty much fascinated with all of your history i find myself thinking about
4477820	4488220	the 1930s a lot lately i don't know why i yeah i just find not necessarily a fan but just it keeps
4488300	4493100	yeah i just i don't know i keep running it over in my head i like really learn so much
4493660	4497660	you're you're your dad's a photographer and your mother is does she do anything
4497660	4504620	creative as well she does dialysis that's only what she does like she needs dialysis or she
4504620	4508860	provides dialysis too she they're both photographers she's she's a freelance
4508860	4515100	dialysis she's not licensed but she has a Nevada you don't have to be so she does it over the phone
4515180	4520540	all right no your mom your mom actually that that's like her specialty she
4520540	4527900	she administrates dialysis like she puts the needle in and watches the yeah yeah damn
4530060	4535180	i remember seeing some like what was this like uh do you watch that john oliver show at hbo
4536700	4543260	they did a segment on dialysis like and how it's like this is that as an industry like dialysis for
4543260	4548780	for money and how it's like like big dialysis like like like people like i think my mom might
4548780	4555500	have so yeah she like i want i i can't remember anything about it except it freaks me out the
4555500	4559980	idea that there's a whole industry where we get our blood changed like jiffy lube well they're
4559980	4564220	probably like stocking your good blood and giving you back like used blood right
4566140	4567820	so do you want to be a teacher bright blood
4567820	4574700	a bunch of bright blood i wish if we could be so lucky to have sprite blood aren't you a little
4574700	4580860	bit uh right so it's good i don't want to make assumptions but if you're a nerd and like i went
4580860	4585420	through this stuff and you weren't like oh no i feel like the bell of the ball in the high school
4585420	4592380	like like assuming a couple things here like you know like 85 percent or so of your student body
4592380	4598540	you're like um aren't you aren't you a little when you think about being a teacher don't you
4598540	4605420	do you don't you get scared like like so then i have to like be the most hated person to these
4605420	4611740	like morons but you know do you feel empathy for them and you want them to be smarter and i want
4611740	4618780	them to be smarter know the history and don't repeat it yeah it's the bad part of history you
4618780	4628860	can repeat the good part if you guys want to do another gold rush go ahead there's gold
4630940	4640380	find gold somewhere go find gold baby uh do you do you do uh i don't want to put you on the spot

4744300	4749020	legacy goes on you know you're like this is the week so give me a historical area
4749420	4753340	uh how about the 1930s because you brought that up
4756140	4761580	talk about the great depression all right okay great depression what was so great about it i
4761580	4765340	mean it seemed like everybody was pissed off i mean come on you can use that
4771340	4772300	the 1930s
4772300	4781900	saw the planet coping with a global economic crisis still the aftermath of the Versailles Treaty
4781900	4788940	from world war one i got that right the biggest bearer of the biggest brunt being the
4790780	4795580	causers of world war one but let's not throw anyone under the bus germany
4795580	4804060	in the streets of berlin you could take a stack of german money and it was more valuable as a
4804060	4812060	door stop than it was legal tender rocks were worth more money than money and the world didn't
4812060	4816780	care you couldn't cry out from from from germany hey we got it pretty bad over here we're really
4816780	4822060	broke like no one's gonna go boo-hoo for the people that had wore spiked helmets looked like
4822060	4828060	darth vader might as the skull and invented mustard gas or caused us to invent it i don't know
4830060	4836540	world war one was really bad world war one was so bad that it defines everything up to it including
4836540	4843900	world war two the 1930s the bridge between those times saw the entire planet going into a right
4843900	4850220	wing slide people were starting to get into this thing called nationalism why is my country
4851100	4858060	uh anyone else's business why isn't it me versus the other countries how do i know other countries
4858060	4864940	have my best interests at heart maybe i should stockpile weaponry maybe i should put a tighter
4864940	4872380	cinch on immigration maybe i should uh industrialize institutionalize even nationalize some of our
4872380	4877660	chiefer institutions maybe there's people in this country already that i don't really
4877660	4882700	like the way they got here in the first place so why are they in control of the garment district
4884940	4890620	why are they all why do why do they get to bank why do they get to gym why do they get to uh
4891500	4896300	get their fingers in these pies and in every country throughout the world scapegoating
4897180	4903340	starts to get it gets funny it gets funny so you have scapegoating you have the ceiling of the
4903340	4909020	borders you have the stockpiling of arms and you start to embrace hierarchy there's an
4909020	4916060	authoritarian instinct inside of all of us when times get tough and confusing the easiest thing
4916060	4925100	to do is to be told what to do you want simplicity you don't want complexity when your family is
4925100	4930780	hungry and when uh the issues are being brought to your face every day you're getting a fire hose
4930780	4935180	of information hey did you hear down the street this person thinks that they have the right to do
4935180	4943260	this when i don't even have a job and when those things happen we look for charismatic people
4944860	4949900	even if they're not charismatic the way we like our friends to be charismatic even if they're
4949900	4955900	the leader version of charismatic people who maybe say the things that we don't want to say
4955900	4960620	to our daughters at the dinner table because we know they'll make us feel stupid or angry or
4960620	4967180	hateful we want someone to just say it really loud so that agreeing with them can be as easy
4967180	4973500	as saying nothing at all and then all the countries start doing that we do it over here
4974060	4980780	we do it over there europe it's concentrated in that landlocked portion these people that
4980780	4986940	when we walked away from world war one and entered all of our depressions we let them
4986940	4994220	you know foot the bill because they they were to blame so they stockpiled more weaponry because
4994220	5000140	you can convert your entire economy into a a perceivable profit if you just say well fuck our
5000140	5009740	dollar let's just say your job is to make a tank and i'll buy it i'm your country yay we're enron
5009740	5016220	so you're just making more tanks and you know there's treaties you agreed to that said you
5016220	5020540	wouldn't do that but everybody's got their own problems and everybody's isolationist and
5020540	5027020	everybody's nationalist so what voting part of the public is going to go yes i agree senator i
5027020	5032620	think we should spend our time monitoring germany and making sure they don't do things we should
5032620	5039020	definitely pay a lot of attention to that huge threat that is that weird guy with that weird
5039020	5044780	haircut who is threatening everyone and saying that he deserves to be on the global stage
5045340	5050860	uh you know you're gonna get a lot more sympathy going fuck that who cares even maybe some people
5050860	5056620	go you know what i like the cut of that guy's jib he's making the trains run on time fuck you
5056620	5064540	senator you're not reelected and so it's like a system that just slides and slides and slides
5064540	5069180	and it lasts years and years and years and it isn't a pendulum that swings it's not like a
5069260	5076620	sine wave it's a it's a it's a linear ramp that just mounts like the flu it just keeps going and
5076620	5083580	going all the countries keep sealing up and stockpiling and mistrusting and then they start
5083580	5089900	the frenzied alliances oh i'm friends with this person because the enemy of the enemy is my friend
5089900	5095420	who's who's to say that this murderer isn't cooler than you at least their clock is bigger
5095500	5100220	at least their missiles are stronger i like them i like you too let's take pictures together oh i
5100220	5106140	love it oh no i hate you oh i'm gonna go to war with you hey just kidding ah there is no truth
5106140	5112060	what's the truth who gives a fuck as long as the poor people aren't storming our castles and
5112060	5119820	hanging us in the marketplace who cares so the stockpiles continue to stockpile and then
5120460	5126060	there's an incident something happens in world war one it was whatever his name was
5126860	5136140	duke fernand archduke bishop uh papantalfoot little lord fauntleroy was murdered
5137340	5141580	but you know i was only supposed to talk about the 30s and the 30s are simply just you know
5142220	5153180	there's this kooky guy in the in the in the europe uh who no one has the energy or the uh uh uh uh
5153180	5164540	the uh international effeteness to uh bother to police starts you know saying well maybe we should
5164540	5168940	be here maybe we should be there maybe the whole problem is that we've been denied our natural
5168940	5174940	right to be everywhere uh and so you don't argue with them and you let them annex and you let them
5174940	5180780	do stuff and meanwhile in the cities where it's happening where there are no cameras people are
5180780	5190380	being categorized and sorted if you say this then you're that that makes you this the media very
5190380	5199180	simply just it's either state run or it's fake news it's just something that isn't supposed to
5199180	5204780	be paid attention to back then it was as easy as taking a molotov cocktail going into the local
5204780	5209820	printing press and kicking it over buying it stealing it beating up the guy that ran it
5212540	5217420	but the bottom line is you take control of the media you control the truth everybody that lives
5217420	5222940	within each boundary they only know one thing which is that everybody's out to get them
5223820	5233260	and then they know pride they know uniforms they know parades colors speeches amazing simple
5233260	5238860	things like oh my god it's been so complicated i'm so tired of being embarrassed at parties
5238860	5244220	so tired of being told i'm this phobic and that phobic and then i owe this person this even though
5244220	5250140	i barely have that god what if it was the truth what if the truth was just so simple what if it
5250140	5256780	was just that everybody that doesn't look like me and wasn't born exactly where i was born is a piece
5256780	5261900	of shit out to get me and they just need to be rounded up and sequestered i'm not going to do
5261900	5267660	anything bad to them i don't wish any harm on them i just want them out of my fucking business
5267660	5272700	out of my face out of my restaurant i don't want that i don't want them in my and my cabinets or
5272700	5277180	in my parliaments i just want them to why can't they take care of themselves like what's the big
5277180	5282220	fucking deal everybody just is out for themselves like i just want to like like like i just want
5282220	5287020	simplicity that's all anyone wants if i see a cookie on a plate and i don't eat it i'm gonna
5287020	5291900	come back and it's gonna be eaten i'm gonna eat it now and the guy stands on a balcony and he says
5291900	5298140	this is what i'm talking about like if you trace everything back we invented it all we're the
5298140	5304460	fucking kings and we have been denied this there was a golden age don't pin me down on it i'm not a
5304460	5311100	historian or anything i'm just a orator i'll just tell you over and over again back then there was
5311100	5316700	this simple time you know what i'm talking about you were 10 years old once didn't it feel simpler
5316700	5323020	then didn't it feel like there was truth and falseness why is it so complicated now what's
5323100	5328780	with the earrings and the tattoos and the biracials and the transamitans what's with all this
5328780	5334380	facebook business fuck this i want to say merry christmas i'm gonna say merry christmas all the
5334380	5341420	day and you cheer and you chant and you parade and the missiles just keep piling up and then
5341420	5346060	eventually you know we get to 1939
5353100	5359180	and the guy that's never been told no is only going to do one thing it's not going to be to
5359180	5366060	take a time out he's tried everything he could fucking do like he still hasn't been told no he
5366140	5369820	still hasn't been challenged not by his own people not by anybody on the global stage
5370540	5376540	so you start going big you do one big thing and then we see how people respond
5378700	5381980	and i think that is that a polish thing is that the invasion of poland
5381980	5385820	maybe the blitzkrieg the blitzkrieg yeah yeah
5388860	5392300	all right so i take it from you're not interrupting me that i kind of nailed it okay
5392620	5403740	all right isabelle you want to give him a grade on that be brutal be brutal a hundred
5403740	5410060	jesus i mean i don't think he used the specifics out of a thousand there's a lot of dates in history
5410060	5414380	was there really a lot of piercings and tattoos going on in berlin and you know the only way
5414380	5423020	to follow that is with sports corner world competition dan harman's gonna break down the
5423020	5427660	world cup standing for you right now had a big day in the world cup and dan harman's gonna give

5467820	5474780	uh you know i mean usa i'm taking them out you know like i don't i don't think we should
5474780	5478220	even consider them in the running i mean that's right because they're not they're not in the
5478220	5483260	running they didn't even make it in this is a european sport yeah but you know italy is always
5483260	5491100	a powerhouse of course the blues the blues yeah yeah you told me that at the bar they're called
5491100	5499820	the blues uh yeah well i mean look i i look yeah speaking of you and me talking uh football
5499820	5505500	at the bar today uh you you were up in a lather you were an invertible lather about the whole
5505500	5510700	video assisted replay thing now they can go back and look at penalties and look at off-sides calls
5510700	5518940	right where do you fall on that dan oh you know i soccer used to be about the uh yardage the yardage
5519180	5527820	and now you can make a cg line uh on the field and you can know exactly when uh lewis suarez is
5527820	5536940	biting someone so i guess i'm for it i like i think there should be more accountability there's
5536940	5540940	a lot of drama out in that field people faking injuries and rolling around now there was one
5540940	5547020	thing when uh on austria i'm serious now i read today when the no so when the swiss team what the
5547100	5553660	first one when the swiss team beat the serbians there's two swiss players who are of albanian
5554460	5559340	uh like ethnic descent who are from Kosovo i mean the swiss are going to perform
5559340	5563500	exactly the same way every year like clockwork
5566700	5570940	it's what they do yeah i think i think i don't even think they care about soccer i think they
5570940	5576220	use it as an opportunity to do meta promotion for their clocks sports corner
5579100	5586220	all right isabelle you're gonna uh do you have a college in mind or is that too early to say
5586860	5592940	i don't have a college i don't have a college in mind yet yeah and i haven't started really
5592940	5599740	looking yeah you shouldn't eat in it i should actually start looking i remember there were a
5599740	5604540	lot of when i when i was in 11th grade it started with the you gotta write a letter to
5604540	5608460	your college there was like a lot of there was so much pressure on the college thing
5609020	5615020	that it really kind of like i think it's why i dropped out immediately so i think it's good
5615020	5619820	that you take it like you're just like you so that you know the day you wake up and go to college
5619820	5625020	you're choosing to go to college because there was so much from from the age of 15 for me i didn't
5625020	5630300	even college was like some religion it was like not a real thing i kept thinking it was this thing
5630300	5635500	that happened after high school where i would and i was basing it like john hugh's movies and things
5635500	5642540	and going like oh i'm gonna then cut classes and and party and be like an adult or like paper chase
5642540	5647020	i'm gonna have arguments with a professor and and then i went and i was like i don't want to be at
5647020	5651340	college and i dropped out so i mean i think it's better that you're not you're not under so much
5651340	5661500	pressure that you can like look at it like a thing you want to do it's the worst podcast ever to
