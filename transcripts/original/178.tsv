0	9440	From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, and the Nerdist Theater, Melty Melty Theater,
9440	14000	Harman Town is now in session.
14000	20240	Let's just get this thing rolling.
20240	28240	The mayor of Harman Town is Dan Harman.
28240	30240	Thank you.
30240	35240	Thank you.
35240	40240	I'm very, very, very sorry that Spencer is not with us tonight.
40240	42240	Is he okay?
42240	45240	Well, I mean, he'll be fine.
45240	48240	You know, he rarely, as you know, he doesn't call in sick.
48240	51240	He said he had a headache that was so bad.
51240	54240	If he wanted to fake something, he could fake better than a headache.
54240	60240	But he said, yeah, it's a headache that's so bad that it's actually making him kind of nauseous and stuff.
60240	67240	So I said, hey, man, just as long as you feed the cat.
67240	70240	Well, he's still under your employee, but he has to.
70240	71240	He really did still have to.
71240	72240	He didn't have to.
72240	73240	He could have bowed out of that, too.
73240	83240	But what he had to do was hand off the cat instructions and medicine regimens and things to the cat sitter.
83240	91240	I'm riding in a hotel right now with Chris McKenna, like trying desperately to finish a pilot before I leave for the holidays.
91240	93240	You guys don't care.
93240	94240	Why the hotel?
94240	97240	Why not distracting at home?
97240	98240	Well, no.
98240	101240	I mean, Chris is allergic to the dogs and stuff.
101240	103240	So then he starts sneezing and wheezing.
103240	105240	And there's just dander everywhere.
105240	108240	It doesn't matter if you lock the dogs out.
108240	111240	What did I tell you, Stan?
111240	114240	The redberry?
114240	118240	What room?
118240	122240	Before that, we were at a place in West Hollywood.
122240	125240	We keep getting hotel suites and trying to finish this thing.
125240	129240	I'm sure we've spent more on hotel suites than we would ever make on the TV show.
130240	137240	But anyways, for continuing the apology department, I'm very sorry about last week's show.
137240	139240	Well, I thought it was a good show.
139240	140240	I listened to it.
140240	142240	I was a little embarrassed.
142240	145240	I was just one of those really, really drunk shows.
145240	148240	I thought Rob was very funny.
148240	151240	I was a little obnoxious.
151240	153240	I was a little combative, you pointed out.
153240	155240	I was a little angry.
155240	158240	I was picking fights and stuff.
158240	162240	I was definitely slurring my words and was kind of like out of it.
162240	165240	So tonight you've made a vow to not drink during the show.
165240	169240	Well, if I started...
169240	173240	Jeff said, is Stan hoisted a red solo cup to his mouth?
173240	177240	I only get that kind of drunk if I've been drinking since like 9am.
177240	179240	So you're just kicking off right now?
179240	180240	Yeah, exactly.
180240	182240	Put the pedal to the metal, baby.
182240	186240	Yeah, we could butt chug and I would be fine.
186240	188240	Kids don't butt chug.
188240	191240	Adults do butt chug.
191240	197240	It's Christmas time in Los Angeles, all of the...
197240	198240	Oh, my God.
198240	203240	Please just go into a burr live song right now.
203240	205240	I heard myself sounding too...
205240	208240	They say Prancer and Dancer.
208240	212240	All the assistants are gone already, so nothing's getting into it.
212240	215240	That's what you can tell us, Christmas time in Los Angeles.
215240	217240	Things are just desolate and...
217240	218240	I really like LA.
218240	221240	Who's staying in town for the holidays?
221240	223240	You guys are lucky.
223240	226240	Don't get tricked into thinking that you have to go places.
226240	231240	I've been going places every Christmas for the last four or five years probably.
231240	233240	It's been a million years since I...
233240	238240	Or four or five, which just caught me in my math.
238240	240240	If you just stay still in Los Angeles,
240240	242240	it's one of the most beautiful holidays you'll ever have.
242240	245240	Go to the roost, have an eggnog, as we always say.
245240	248240	Everywhere you go, it's like everybody else fucks off.
248240	250240	It's LA the way it probably...
250240	257240	It's like a two-week-long Coachella where all the assholes are gone.
257240	261240	It's probably nice in New York, too, where I'm going and where you'll be joining me.
261240	262240	I'll be there, too.
262240	265240	Are you going to be there for Christmas or after Christmas?
265240	266240	Yeah, I'm coming just after.
266240	267240	The whole sheboots.
267240	269240	The whole sheboots?
269240	271240	I didn't know you spoke Yiddish.
272240	274240	All the Michigas.
280240	282240	Jeff, are you aware of Snapchat?
287240	291240	I would be lying if I said I knew anything about it.
291240	299240	Snapchat is a new thing for millennials that empowers them
300240	307240	by virtue of temporary media storage to show their impulsive side.
309240	313240	How often have you been at Disneyland and been drunk with your friends on turkey leg
313240	316240	and just wanted to express that and then thought...
316240	318240	You know that most of that turkey leg is emu.
318240	320240	It's emu. A lot of that turkey leg is emu.
320240	322240	That was not worth interrupting me.
324240	327240	Yeah, but Dan, you're in the pocket of big turkey.
328240	331240	Yes, it's emu. It's turkey leg is emu.
331240	334240	Sorry, go ahead. We'll get back to the emus.
334240	337240	Say, if the kids are out there and you're feeling good and you're having a good time,
337240	346240	you're at one of your foam parties or your hologram jerk-offs
347240	355240	where the hologram jerks you off into a cup that's off the grid.
357240	363240	Before you take a bike ride with your dog and put your phone in a box.
367240	369240	You might think, oh, I just want to express this.
369240	373240	But you put it on Facebook and how do you know if 20 years from now
373240	379240	when you're running for senator, it's not going to be politically incorrect to say,
379240	382240	what's up, gee-hads?
384240	387240	I'm riding a bike with my dog.
387240	391240	Is the dog on his own bike or is he in a basket like 18?
391240	394240	Dogs in the basket with your phone.
395240	400240	Snapchat lets you say stuff like that and then it's like, oh, it'll be gone in a little bit.
400240	402240	How long does it exist?
402240	406240	Well, there's a lot of different functionality that they've been adding to Snapchat, Jeff.
407240	411240	There's your standard foundational dick pic of technology,
411240	413240	which is not dick pic proof.
413240	414240	We're not talking about dick pics.
414240	415240	That's always been a zero-sum game.
415240	417240	People can screen grab your dick pics.
417240	420240	Snapchat will notify you that your dick pic has been grabbed.
420240	423240	And it will say who grabbed your dick?
423240	428240	Yes, it will say Jeff Davis grabbed your pic, yes.
428240	430240	And you'll go like, hmm, interesting.
430240	434240	And then we're not friends anymore unless we have a conversation.
434240	437240	I don't know, maybe I wanted you to grab my dick.
437240	439240	The night is very young.
439240	442240	There's new courtship rituals erupting out of this stuff.
442240	446240	So it's videos, pictures, both? Either one?
446240	449240	And then it lives, how long does it live?
449240	451240	Ten seconds?
451240	454240	Twenty-four hours depending on how you...
454240	457240	Well, there's still, like I said, there's two different functionalities.
457240	461240	So there's one, if I could just take a picture or a video
461240	467240	and I can send it to, like, as many of my friends' followers as I want.
467240	472240	Those people can watch it once or now if they pay a nominal fee.
472240	473240	Wait, what?
473240	475240	Twice.
475240	477240	You can monetize your Snapchats?
477240	480240	Well, no, Snapchat can monetize Snapchat.
480240	486240	The other functionality is something I find very interesting called my story.
486240	488240	That's what I've been snapping.
488240	492240	Because you sent me a text that was you opening your mouth in a video
492240	494240	and a rainbow barfing out of your mouth.
494240	499240	That was just an example of Snapchat's amazing ad-ons, like visual effects.
499240	501240	But does that go away off of my phone in 24 hours?
501240	504240	No, no, no, I saved that. I made that.
504240	505240	You can save your own shit.
505240	507240	Ah, gotcha.
507240	510240	But my story thing is like a 24-hour buffer.
510240	511240	It's like a treadmill.
511240	515240	And so anything that you made 24 hours ago, that goes off the end of the treadmill.
515240	516240	You never see that again.
516240	520240	So anything you make in 24 hours, that's available to...
520240	521240	That's your story.
521240	523240	People can click on that and go,
523240	526240	Oh, look what Marissa's been doing over the last...
526240	528240	Great. I'm glad you could make it.
534240	538240	Rob Schwab did the most horrifying entrance and exits at the same time.
538240	542240	I'm up here talking about fucking Snapchat waiting for this prick.
543240	546240	You're up here making podcast dynamite.
547240	552240	I hope that Rob just kept that movement and he's walking out to his car and never returns.
552240	555240	That he was in the audience and now he's calling an Uber?
560240	562240	That's his story.
562240	563240	That's his story.
563240	566240	That's Rob's Snapchat story.
566240	569240	He has become Snapchat.
569240	571240	He really is.
571240	573240	He's self-shropping, self-Snapchatting.
573240	575240	We call Shrobs Snapchat now.
577240	579240	I don't know why I have this open.
579240	581240	There's nothing in there.
581240	585240	The bad part is comedy works in threes, so we know that's coming back.
588240	590240	I've subscribed to Pornhub Premium.
595240	596240	I gotta say, Dan.
602240	604240	Can I just say this?
605240	609240	As much as we love Erin McGathey and Miss Er, single you is a lot more exciting.
612240	615240	You're snapping your chats?
616240	622240	By the way, I hope you don't think that he's divorcing so he's Snapchatting because he's trying to creep on.
622240	624240	I don't know if Snapchat you can use.
624240	625240	Can you creep on Snapchat?
625240	627240	I don't know. That's not what I'm doing at all.
627240	629240	It's narcissistic.
629240	631240	I have eight followers on Snapchat.
631240	633240	I've been Snapchatting.
633240	641240	If you caught my story in the last 24 hours, you would have seen the process of me trying to write a pilot with Chris McKenna in a hotel room for 48 hours.
641240	643240	But now it's gone.
643240	646240	Because I blew it. I didn't write it down.
646240	649240	What is the allure? Do you follow anybody on Snapchat?
649240	652240	Are you following Chris McKenna or anybody else?
652240	659240	I follow my dog border, the guy I'm leaving my dogs with when I go to New York.
659240	660240	He has a Snapchat.
660240	661240	You want to know what he's up to?
661240	664240	Well, he just, yeah, you click on him and he's like, I'm in Laurel Canyon.
664240	667240	Oh! And the dogs are like, oh!
670240	673240	Can I write down that guy's Snapchat address?
673240	674240	This sounds like good shit.
674240	678240	Well, I don't know if, I don't know how that works. Is that private or?
678240	679240	I don't know.
679240	685240	I'm asking you, what would be the allure of me as a friend of yours following you on Snapchat?
685240	691240	I would say an inside look into the comings and goings of my comings and goings.
691240	694240	Which brings us back to porn.
694240	698240	It's like a video Twitter feed.
698240	701240	And I haven't been on Twitter in like weeks.
701240	706240	The only bad thing about not being on Twitter has been that it's the only place you would go to say something like,
706240	709240	my life is going so well not being on Twitter.
709240	713240	It really is something that you want to just express to the world, which Twitter is really good for.
713240	718240	And then I almost get on Twitter to go, not being on Twitter is awesome. What am I doing?
718240	721240	Right. So it's the disposable nature of Snapchat.
721240	726240	The fact that things don't exist for good unless somebody's screen grabs your dick.
726240	730240	I assume that's the allure for millennials.
730240	734240	I'm a Gen Xer, died in the wool. I love archiving.
734240	737240	I'd like to think that all my stuff lasts forever.
737240	744240	But you know what? You got to recognize Jeff, CDs, VHS.
744240	749240	And also, here's another thing that's fleeting. I have some sad news for everybody.
749240	754240	Well, it's sad news for me. It'll be fodder for you.
754240	766240	I, as you know, have had a 15-year je ne sais quoi, a relationship,
766240	776240	my longest sexual relationship with a bent plastic mannequin leg, size six foot, made for hosiery displays,
776240	781240	in some golden age where hosiery displays needed to be anatomically perfect.
811240	823240	You take your shirt off exposing your gigantic, ursine, oily, zit-covered, hut-like frame.
823240	830240	You warble into bed like a pasty cloud.
830240	833240	We have our episode title.
833240	837240	Like a beached albino porpoise.
837240	842240	And then you either maybe watch some porns.
842240	848240	Maybe you even don't. Maybe you're kind of feeling like a little crazy and you just want to focus on the leg.
848240	850240	Sometimes you combine the leg with the porn?
850240	851240	Yeah.
851240	853240	Okay.
853240	856240	But it doesn't really work if you're watching like people go fully at it and then you're like,
856240	859240	and then there's this leg.
859240	863240	Usually what I'll do is if I'm watching something with the leg,
863240	870240	I will watch a YouTube channel called Legs Lavish.
870240	883240	It's your one-stop shop for honest reviews of hosiery for women by women.
883240	884240	It's by women.
884240	891240	The comment section is like fake women's names and just honest guys' names.
891240	892240	Talking about women.
892240	894240	Going like, those are great.
894240	900240	Try on some more. Review some more hosiery for me.
900240	905240	Legs Lavish. Check it out on YouTube.
905240	906240	All right.
906240	907240	So sometimes you're watching the movie.
907240	908240	Sometimes it's just you and the leg.
908240	913240	I recommend Alicia.
913240	920240	She's got a professional edge and she has some winter outfits that are like,
920240	925240	she puts out a little yarn cap and gloves and a cashmere scarf and a sweater
925240	929240	and a short skirt, but not slutty short.
929240	933240	Like a little bit above the knee and then like these little boots
933240	937240	and then of course the tights that she's reviewing, these winter tights.
937240	943240	And then I might, maybe I'll rub a mannequin leg on my nipple while I watch that.
943240	945240	And I'll go, that's a good review, Alicia.
945240	950240	Do you prefer or favor one nipple over the other?
950240	952240	That's usually going to end up being my left nipple.
952240	954240	Who knows why?
954240	956240	Probably because I'm right-brained.
956240	959240	No, it's because you're jerking off with your right hand because you're right-handed.
959240	962240	Oh, yeah.
962240	963240	All right.
963240	964240	I can't remember.
964240	966240	Okay, so here's the bad news.
967240	970240	The bad news.
970240	974240	Fucking buckle your holy shit belts, everybody.
974240	979240	This is the part where you're going to feel sorry for me.
979240	983240	Up until now you've been Abraham Lincoln.
983240	989240	My life's going to take a dark turn in a minute.
989240	998240	I haven't used, you know, Old Faithful since I got it out after the divorce.
998240	1002240	And during the marriage, I adopted two dogs.
1002240	1004240	And so I...
1004240	1007240	Oh, spaghetti-o.
1007240	1015240	So Nigel, who loves eating underwear and shoes and pens and cat food cans
1015240	1020240	and ninja stars and rocks and cat shit
1020240	1027240	and fucking leaf blower wires and couches and his own shit
1027240	1032240	but not enough and paper towels on the roll
1032240	1039240	and the fucking window sills and blankets and the stairs.
1039240	1041240	He eats everything.
1041240	1046240	So why would I think it was okay to rub a mannequin leg on my nipple and then go to work?
1046240	1049240	Just leave it there, laying on the bed.
1049240	1051240	Nigel took Old Faithful down?
1051240	1055240	He chewed exactly precisely.
1055240	1058240	He chewed the big toe.
1058240	1060240	That's your nipple toe!
1060240	1062240	That's your nipple toe!
1062240	1067240	Turning it into a gnarled, like, the look of it,
1067240	1073240	not the texture because this would be soft, but the look of it is like a corn cob with no corn on it.
1073240	1076240	Like, because it's just all... yeah.
1076240	1081240	But it's all hard-chewed plastic.
1081240	1083240	Have you tried that out?
1083240	1086240	No, I can't even... it's gross to even look at.
1086240	1091240	Everything that's sexy about this whole thing is just smoothness and softness
1091240	1094240	and, of course, autonomy and creepiness.
1094240	1099240	But now it's a gnarled, like, just anemone.
1099240	1104240	Was there ever a time that Nigel walked in on you while you were doing that?
1104240	1106240	Was there some sort of jealousy?
1106240	1109240	It's like, pay more attention to me, I'm going to eat this toe off of this fucking guy.
1109240	1112240	Like I told you, he eats everything.
1112240	1114240	He cast a white in it.
1114240	1116240	That's so sad.
1116240	1118240	No, I don't think I can replace it.
1118240	1125240	I mean, that thing, like I told you, I had to humiliate myself at a weird West Covino warehouse or something.
1125240	1127240	All right, let's move on.
1127240	1128240	One more question.
1128240	1134240	How often do you go in and restock the hosiery?
1134240	1136240	Now and never.
1136240	1140240	I'm saying, before this happened, is this a monthly, weekly, yearly...
1140240	1141240	I mean, what do you mean?
1141240	1145240	Because the question should be, how much do I buy when I buy it?
1145240	1151240	Like, there was a time before Amazon Prime.
1151240	1156240	Andy?
1156240	1157240	Lethal weapon?
1157240	1163240	Lethal weapon.
1163240	1165240	You know, you would have to...
1165240	1173240	If it's just a pervert going into Albertsons, you got to walk out with like a little package of something
1173240	1177240	and it looks like maybe you could be buying it for a wife that's waiting at home
1177240	1183240	and then you also have to do the fake toothpaste and the fake paper towel roll or something.
1183240	1185240	Like, oh boy, I need so many random things.
1185240	1188240	But you can't get 30 of those stockings.
1188240	1194240	A better man than I am could, maybe, and look at the cashier and say,
1194240	1196240	I like to jerk off on a mannequin leg.
1196240	1199240	I'll see you next summer.
1199240	1200240	Because I'm buying in bulk.
1200240	1201240	Did we talk...
1201240	1206240	But with Amazon, I just...
1206240	1207240	But no more.
1207240	1208240	No more.
1208240	1209240	Because the things...
1209240	1210240	You're not going to try to replace it?
1210240	1213240	Look, man, we're talking in circles.
1213240	1214240	No, no, I'm saying...
1214240	1215240	There's no replacing it.
1215240	1217240	It was one of a kind.
1217240	1220240	Did you ever see Cherry 2000, the movie with Melanie Griffith?
1220240	1223240	I lost my Cherry 2000.
1223240	1227240	I would have to go fight Tim Thomerson in The Wasteland to get...
1227240	1230240	Just watch it and get some culture.
1230240	1236240	If Harbin Town can leave you with one message, just get some culture.
1236240	1238240	These poor kids, they have nothing.
1238240	1239240	What do you got?
1239240	1242240	Thumb drives full of Wi-Fi's.
1242240	1244240	Isn't it possible?
1244240	1247240	And again, I'm not trying to...
1247240	1250240	Tim Thomerson, look him up.
1250240	1253240	So you're saying now it's hard to go out and replace that
1253240	1256240	because it's hard for you to go into a store that wants Covina
1256240	1258240	and buy that mannequin leg.
1258240	1262240	Are you saying that was just so singular and special that it's irreplaceable?
1262240	1265240	No, I'm podcasting about it.
1265240	1270240	I would walk in with a marching band if I could find another model.
1270240	1278240	I would go, sir, I'm here for one thing alone for one reason.
1278240	1283240	But I just think I'm busy now and trying to develop TV shows and stuff.
1283240	1285240	So who's got the time?
1285240	1286240	Interesting.
1287240	1288240	End of an era.
1288240	1290240	How many years was Old Faithful with you?
1290240	1294240	It's got to be like 15, I think, or 13, something.
1294240	1296240	Longest relationship I've ever had with anything.
1296240	1299240	Was Old Faithful in the menagerie at your old Hollywood place?
1299240	1300240	Absolutely.
1300240	1305240	It was the only one that survived because everything else didn't do anything.
1305240	1310240	Full mannequins.
1310240	1312240	Sorry, ladies.
1312240	1314240	There's nothing to you.
1314240	1319240	If you could restore and have Old Faithful back without the gnarled corncob toe
1319240	1328240	or five real dolls, kind of like an endless supply of real dolls,
1328240	1333240	would you rather have the fleeting experience of the latex real doll
1333240	1336240	or have Old Faithful back in its pristine form?
1336240	1337240	Well, I mean, come on.
1337240	1343240	You're talking about like a $30,000 real doll value that could probably be,
1343240	1344240	I don't know.
1344240	1345240	That's crazy.
1345240	1346240	That's a crazy question.
1346240	1347240	I'm sure I could sk...
1347240	1349240	I would really have to think about it because...
1349240	1352240	It's a good question then.
1352240	1355240	Especially if I could get the fully extended one back
1355240	1360240	because remember I had the fully extended one and then the bent one.
1360240	1362240	What happened to the fully extended one?
1362240	1366240	Over the years, you make sacrifices because girlfriends go,
1366240	1367240	what are these?
1367240	1372240	And you go, I rub them on my nipple.
1372240	1373240	I used to.
1373240	1376240	Are you going to, again, do you want me to rub them on your nipple?
1376240	1378240	No.
1378240	1379240	Do you want to keep them?
1379240	1385240	Well, that would be to imply the possibility of life after you.
1385240	1394240	But maybe the smaller one that doesn't take up very much storage space...
1394240	1399240	Hide that in your golf bag.
1399240	1404240	Let's bring out Rob Schrod.
1404240	1405240	Oh, yeah.
1405240	1411240	Time went over, baby, and I buy you more.
1411240	1416240	Turned out, she's somebody else that's tough.
1416240	1420240	Could be trouble, but it could be firms and it could be trouble.
1420240	1425240	Could be firms, baby.
1425240	1431240	Rob has a mysterious bag.
1431240	1432240	Snapchat.
1432240	1433240	Snapchat?
1433240	1435240	Hey, Rob, how you doing, man?
1435240	1436240	I'm doing okay.
1436240	1437240	How are you?
1437240	1438240	I'm very well, thank you.
1438240	1440240	Brought to you by Lassen's.
1440240	1445240	You have a bag from Lassen's, the Mormon health food store in Los Feliz?
1445240	1446240	Yes.
1446240	1450240	Keeping very weird hours and there's 17 aisles that have chips in it.
1450240	1451240	There's no...
1452240	1453240	Sorry.
1457240	1461240	I did not try to tee you up for that.
1461240	1465240	But that's not what's in the bag.
1465240	1466240	Am I right?
1466240	1468240	I ran out of chips, so I'm here.
1468240	1469240	Okay.
1469240	1470240	What's in the bag?
1470240	1472240	Is this a reveal that we have to save for later?
1472240	1473240	Oh, what's in the bag?
1473240	1480240	I was cleaning up and I found all of the models from the GI Joe episode commercial.
1480240	1485240	I was going to give it to Steve Levy or Spencer and neither one of them are here.
1485240	1489240	So I can't trust it with you because it'll be in an Uber somewhere.
1489240	1492240	So I'm going to have to take this home and...
1492240	1494240	So I took an Uber somewhere the other day.
1494240	1495240	Okay.
1495240	1496240	Yesterday.
1496240	1497240	Yes.
1497240	1498240	I took it to the Redberry Hotel.
1498240	1499240	Redberry.
1499240	1502240	Ah, the Redberry.
1502240	1507240	Where the celebrities sleep.
1507240	1508240	The Redberry.
1508240	1512240	You're already home.
1512240	1518240	And as we pulled up to the location, welcome to the Redberry.
1518240	1522240	Should we re-enact your arrival at the Redberry?
1522240	1525240	I'd prefer to tell my story first.
1525240	1528240	And then we'll re-enact it.
1528240	1529240	And then we'll re-enact it.
1529240	1534240	But we'll get different periods in history and we'll do your Redberry story as that was set during the Civil War.
1534240	1538240	All I ask is to be able to just tell my story.
1538240	1545240	The driver, as we pulled up to the Redberry, he started saying over and over again,
1545240	1550240	Pull up the Uber map.
1550240	1553240	Pull up the Uber map and give to me.
1553240	1555240	I put in code.
1555240	1556240	I put in code.
1556240	1558240	He was just repeating these phrases.
1558240	1566240	He wanted me to give him my phone so he could put in a promotional code.
1566240	1569240	So as he put it, he could give me a 20% discount.
1569240	1574240	And I kept saying, I don't want, I don't like this.
1574240	1576240	Tell me the code.
1576240	1577240	20% discount.
1577240	1580240	And I said, but I don't, you can tell me the code.
1580240	1582240	Give me the idol.
1582240	1584240	Just give me phone.
1584240	1585240	I put in code.
1585240	1586240	Give me the idol.
1586240	1589240	I was like, I don't want to give you my phone.
1589240	1592240	I don't know you.
1592240	1594240	It's my phone.
1594240	1597240	And he's like, 20%.
1597240	1607240	I said, I would like to pay you 40% extra to stop asking me for my personal property
1607240	1611240	after giving me a ride to a hotel.
1611240	1614240	It's close to a mugging.
1615240	1618240	If I felt like I needed to give it to you, then you'd be mugging me.
1618240	1623240	His concern was that if he tells you the code, you're going to tell everybody at Harman Town what the code is?
1623240	1627240	Well, I've heard stories, and maybe somebody can help me out there.
1627240	1629240	Rumors.
1629240	1637240	I thought I heard a story from somebody that I couldn't recall, but I had this post-it note in my head
1637240	1641240	about this whole give me your phone, I'm going to put in a code thing.
1641240	1649240	And I thought I remembered the story being they upgrade your ride to Lux or Looper Dooper or something.
1649240	1652240	They do some weird shit.
1652240	1658240	There can't be a system in place where they need to touch your phone.
1658240	1659240	Ah, shit.
1659240	1662240	If it's one thing, it's another.
1662240	1665240	I tell you, man.
1665240	1666240	Yeah, man.
1666240	1667240	Shit, man.
1667240	1671240	Those Uber drivers are really getting me down, too.
1671240	1673240	It's oppressive.
1673240	1676240	So oppressive.
1676240	1677240	Aw, man.
1677240	1680240	Trump is...
1680240	1684240	His shit is still going on.
1684240	1686240	Uber drivers.
1686240	1689240	Emotional codes, E24, man.
1689240	1692240	DoorDash, Tinder, Snapchat.
1692240	1694240	DoorDash.
1694240	1698240	DoorDash, jeans, all that stuff.
1698240	1699240	Man.
1699240	1701240	You don't use Snapchat, do you?
1701240	1705240	I don't even know what that is.
1705240	1708240	I consider myself a snappist.
1708240	1711240	You brought me out why again?
1711240	1713240	Let's bring out Rob.
1713240	1714240	Hey, how you doing?
1714240	1723240	Let me tell you something about my day yesterday.
1723240	1727240	What is the proper way to use you in a show?
1727240	1729240	You asked me to come.
1729240	1731240	What? Yeah.
1731240	1733240	That's not my issue.
1733240	1734240	The kids like you.
1734240	1735240	Then use me.
1735240	1737240	Use me properly.
1737240	1739240	That's not my problem.
1739240	1747240	Using you properly is bringing you out and letting you disrespect me and the show.
1747240	1749240	That's the way.
1750240	1756240	You're talking like if you went to a rodeo and it's like, get that clown out of there.
1756240	1759240	He's just riling the bull up.
1759240	1766240	I thought the goal was to...
1766240	1771240	I came here to see a bull asleep.
1771240	1774240	I came here to see the pacification of a bull.
1774240	1778240	The ideal rodeo, I would show up and the bull would be laying there.
1779240	1784240	Who's this guy with the hair running around in barrels?
1784240	1796240	I thought you're a caustic, destructive, parasitic, symbiotic influence on the show that the kids enjoy
1796240	1801240	because they like to see me angry.
1801240	1806240	So talk about your day.
1806240	1812240	I got all this G.I. Jeff stuff here and that's what I got.
1812240	1817240	Oh boy, that G.I. Jeff stuff.
1817240	1820240	What's going on with that?
1823240	1825240	This doesn't work when I do it.
1825240	1827240	Was that you doing him or is that you?
1827240	1829240	Yeah, I was trying to.
1829240	1833240	That was me doing me doing him.
1833240	1836240	What was the hotel?
1836240	1838240	The Redbury.
1838240	1841240	Welcome to the Redbury.
1841240	1842240	Oh, you want to do the scene?
1842240	1843240	Welcome to the Redbury.
1843240	1846240	Let me get that door for you, Mr. Harmon.
1846240	1848240	Let me get that door for you.
1848240	1850240	Let me open up that door.
1850240	1853240	Got any baggage today?
1853240	1855240	Well, let me help you out here.
1855240	1856240	Watch your step.
1856240	1858240	There's a puddle.
1858240	1860240	All right.
1860240	1864240	The Uber driver says the Uber driver wants your phone.
1864240	1868240	If I could have your phone so the Uber driver could get your...
1868240	1872240	Please, sir, we want to get this vehicle out of the way.
1872240	1876240	If you could just give me your phone so the Uber driver can punch it.
1876240	1880240	It's a promotional code if you could give me your phone so the Uber driver...
1880240	1884240	Jerome, Jerome, leave Mr. Harmon at peace, please.
1884240	1888240	He's a valued guest here at the Redbury, Jerome.
1888240	1889240	I'm sorry.
1889240	1893240	Jerome, can I talk to you in my office for just one minute?
1893240	1894240	Okay.
1894240	1895240	Mr. Harmon, I'm sorry.
1895240	1896240	Mr. Harmon, please.
1896240	1898240	I'm going to have to let you go for a second.
1898240	1899240	Please.
1899240	1900240	I've got to go talk to my boss.
1900240	1901240	Stay.
1901240	1902240	Okay.
1902240	1903240	Please.
1903240	1905240	Avail yourself of the free coconut...
1905240	1906240	Excuse me.
1906240	1908240	Cucumber water that we have, Mr. Harmon.
1908240	1909240	Yes, yes.
1909240	1910240	Yeah, let me...
1910240	1911240	Camellia will check you in.
1911240	1913240	Yeah, bathe yourself in the coconut water.
1913240	1916240	Camellia will see to you would you roam in my office at once.
1916240	1918240	Uber driver, please, Uber, please.
1918240	1919240	Uber, you...
1919240	1920240	Uber.
1920240	1922240	Mr. Uber driver, get into my office as well.
1922240	1923240	Yes.
1923240	1925240	Jerome, Uber driver, come into my office.
1925240	1926240	All right.
1926240	1927240	Jerome, Uber driver?
1927240	1928240	Yes.
1928240	1929240	Did you get the phone?
1929240	1930240	I...
1930240	1932240	He wouldn't give me the phone.
1932240	1934240	Get the phone.
1934240	1937240	He won't open map.
1937240	1943240	Uber driver, what country are you fucking from?
1943240	1945240	Open map, I show you.
1945240	1947240	All right.
1947240	1949240	Here's my phone.
1949240	1950240	Okay.

1951240	1952240	Bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup.
1952240	1954240	Launch codes initiated.
1954240	1955240	Oh shit!
1955240	1957240	Ha ha!
1957240	1961240	Now send five stars to my offshore accounts.
1961240	1962240	What?
1962240	1963240	What?
1963240	1964240	And now call off the air strike.
1964240	1966240	Tell me what country you're from.
1966240	1967240	Who do you work for?
1967240	1968240	Beeswax.
1968240	1971240	None of ya!
1971240	1974240	Republic of...
1974240	1977240	I hold the cards here.
1977240	1984240	Did you say you're collecting stars and putting them in your offshore account?
1984240	1990240	Like in Switzerland you've got all these five star reports in another account?
1990240	1992240	These stars are symbolic.
1992240	1994240	There's no currency in these stars.
1994240	1997240	There's no currency, but he's got such an eye rating.
1997240	1999240	And we can't get him!
1999240	2001240	And we can't get at it!
2001240	2003240	We can't get him that rating.
2003240	2007240	More stars, more business, more business, more life!
2007240	2009240	Wait, was that...
2009240	2010240	Are you kidding me?
2010240	2012240	Was that your...
2012240	2016240	Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
2016240	2018240	Jerome, Jerome, leave the office for a moment.
2018240	2019240	All right, I'm good.
2019240	2021240	Turn the lights down on the way out.
2021240	2023240	Okay, here.
2023240	2024240	I'm gonna go to the arcade.
2024240	2025240	Uber driver.
2025240	2026240	Oh.
2026240	2028240	Bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup.

2030240	2032240	Uh, it already started.
2055240	2056240	Go the distance.
2056240	2057240	Go the distance.
2059240	2060240	Go the distance.
2061240	2064240	You're a bad boy. You're a bad boy.
2072240	2083240	I live in the tunnel inside Pac-Man.
2084240	2086240	Don't go into the tunnel, boy.
2087240	2088240	Shut up, Mom.
2088240	2090240	I told you never to go into the tunnel.
2090240	2091240	I have to go into the tunnel.
2091240	2093240	The tunnel's a metaphor for your subconscious mind.
2096240	2099240	Are you, uh, gonna keep playing that game?
2100240	2103240	Yeah, don't you see all the fucking quarters that are lined up here?
2104240	2107240	Buddy, those are bottle caps.
2107240	2114240	And you're standing in front of a refrigerator.
2118240	2121240	And it's the year 2037.
2124240	2127240	And I'm a Medusa lady.
2132240	2133240	Do a stretch.
2133240	2134240	Yep.
2137240	2139240	Creep show. Creep show.
2140240	2142240	I just got creep showed.
2143240	2145240	Mr. Harmon, Mr. Harmon, sorry for the delay.
2145240	2148240	I trust that Camille has you all checked into your room?
2149240	2152240	Yes. I love the cucumber water.
2152240	2154240	I wouldn't mind getting the recipe.
2157240	2161240	If you would hand me your phone, I'd be very happy to give you the recipe.
2162240	2164240	Well, everything's worth a risk.
2167240	2168240	Jerome.
2168240	2169240	Yes.
2170240	2171240	I'm sorry, Mr. Harmon.
2171240	2174240	I have to take Jerome into my office one more time.
2175240	2176240	One second.
2185240	2186240	Yes.
2188240	2190240	I have what you wanted.
2190240	2192240	I have Dan Harmon's phone.
2195240	2197240	I'm going to give you Dan Harmon's phone, Jerome.
2197240	2198240	Okay.
2198240	2199240	Under one condition.
2199240	2200240	Yes.
2200240	2202240	That you use it for good and not for evil.
2202240	2203240	Okay.
2203240	2205240	I give you the phone.
2206240	2209240	And I evaporate into a mist.
2211240	2212240	I was never here.
2220240	2221240	Boop-a-doop-a-doop.
2223240	2224240	Boop-a-doop.
2226240	2228240	Boop-a-doop-a-doop.
2229240	2230240	Boop-a-doop.
2231240	2233240	Welcome to Pornhub Prime.
2234240	2236240	MC!
2237240	2238240	That's premium.
2240240	2241240	Thanks.
2241240	2242240	All right.
2242240	2245240	The mighty Harmon art players.
2246240	2249240	You never know when they're going to burst into their stagecraft.
2251240	2253240	Let's take things up a notch.
2254240	2258240	Our next guest is a technical writer for video game user guides.
2260240	2262240	He's worked at...
2262240	2263240	You can stay, Rob.
2263240	2264240	Yeah.
2264240	2265240	No, yeah.
2265240	2266240	Stay here.
2266240	2267240	Come on.
2267240	2268240	Don't be intimidated by this guy.
2268240	2269240	Moving over a chair.
2269240	2270240	Oh.
2270240	2271240	Oh, yeah.
2271240	2272240	No, that's good.
2272240	2273240	Yeah.
2273240	2274240	Yeah.
2274240	2275240	Do that.
2275240	2276240	But you can come out.
2277240	2278240	Yeah.
2278240	2279240	Okay.
2279240	2280240	Oliva.
2288240	2289240	Wow.
2289240	2290240	All right.
2290240	2291240	That's what that is.
2291240	2292240	There you go.
2292240	2293240	Hello, Fred.
2293240	2294240	Hi, there.
2294240	2295240	All right.
2295240	2300240	So I think a lot of us, when we buy video games, the first thing we do is we read the
2300240	2301240	user manual.
2301240	2302240	No.
2302240	2303240	No, exactly.
2304240	2305240	Well, that was my joke.
2305240	2307240	I've wasted my entire life.
2308240	2310240	No, but you've been doing this since 2005.
2310240	2314240	Your first game that you wrote a technical manual for was Narnia.
2314240	2315240	Yes.
2315240	2316240	The Chronicles of Narnia.
2316240	2320240	And it was for Disney, the same company for which you work today.
2320240	2321240	That's true.
2321240	2323240	Your second game was Chicken Little.
2323240	2325240	Yes.
2325240	2326240	Another adaptation.
2326240	2327240	Zach Brahm's big hit.
2328240	2331240	But most recently, and you've brought this work with you.
2331240	2332240	Oh, I have.
2332240	2333240	I have.
2333240	2337240	You've written a user guide for Disney's Infinity.
2337240	2340240	And I thought maybe you could read a couple excerpts.
2344240	2347240	There was a troubleshooting section that I thought really captured.
2347240	2348240	Wait.
2348240	2351240	So when you buy a video game, this will be in the box that you get.
2351240	2353240	And you look through this.
2353240	2354240	Okay.
2354240	2355240	Gotcha.
2355240	2357240	And you are the person that creates, writes all the texts, all the stuff.
2357240	2358240	This is my life's work.
2358240	2359240	This is your work.
2359240	2360240	Yeah.
2360240	2361240	Okay.
2362240	2363240	Just quiet down.
2364240	2365240	Can we dim the lights?
2365240	2366240	Yeah.
2367240	2368240	Perfect.
2373240	2376240	Setting up the Disney Infinity Base.
2382240	2386240	Once removed from the packaging, the Disney Infinity Base.
2386240	2388240	I wish you'd take this seriously.
2389240	2391240	This is your life's work, Fred.
2391240	2393240	Pictured below.
2397240	2401240	Needs to be placed on a stable, secure, and even surface.
2401240	2403240	A table.
2407240	2408240	Could have just had a table.
2408240	2410240	Near the console.
2411240	2417240	Do not place a Disney Infinity Base on the console.
2419240	2421240	Or on metal surfaces.
2422240	2425240	Or have metallic objects nearby.
2426240	2428240	What about a giant magnet?
2431240	2432240	That wouldn't be good.
2432240	2433240	Nope.
2433240	2434240	I like that.
2434240	2435240	Can I put it in a microwave?
2438240	2440240	Nah, that wouldn't work either.
2440240	2444240	And there's a few pages of that, but then it goes on and it's in all the different languages from around the world.
2444240	2446240	But you don't have to do that, right?
2446240	2448240	You just hand that off and then someone else translates it.
2448240	2450240	I'm actually fluent in Portuguese.
2450240	2452240	Do you want to do the Portuguese version?
2452240	2453240	Portuguese! Portuguese!
2454240	2456240	I think I overstepped my batteries on that.
2457240	2458240	How about this?
2458240	2465240	Rob, you've just purchased Disney's Infinity and you have some trouble that you need to have shot.
2467240	2473240	But you've made a huge error and you've called up a guy who only troubleshoots in Portuguese.
2477240	2478240	This didn't happen?
2479240	2482240	And you are being portrayed by Billy Zane in this.
2492240	2495240	Sorry Fred, I didn't know that you would be required to do improv.
2495240	2497240	I'm happy to be next to Billy Zane.
2498240	2502240	I don't know if my hair is shaved close enough to do this.
2503240	2507240	I would love to hear the troubleshooting that you just read in the Portuguese language.
2507240	2508240	It's a beautiful language.
2509240	2512240	I was actually snapchatting my big toe to Uber.
2514240	2515240	Sorry about that.
2521240	2522240	Sorry, I was lost.
2523240	2524240	I just found where I am.
2525240	2526240	Okay.
2531240	2532240	That's in French.
2533240	2534240	Yeah, that was in Portuguese.
2535240	2536240	I am a little bit.
2537240	2538240	That wasn't the troubleshooting guide.
2538240	2539240	That wasn't the troubleshooting guide.
2539240	2541240	Alright, well let's talk about your craft.
2542240	2550240	So, obviously you get a video game and then you play it.
2550240	2555240	Now, when you get it, I'm assuming that it comes with notes that the people that made the game, they must have scribbles of like how the game works.
2556240	2560240	Right, the dev team and actually QA and all the people that worked on the game.
2561240	2562240	Quality assurance.
2563240	2564240	Nice.
2568240	2575240	Yes, so basically what you want to do is you're kind of like the conduit between the dev team and QA.
2576240	2577240	Make sure you eat that mic.
2577240	2589240	Sorry, you're kind of like the conduit between the dev team and QA and the user.
2590240	2593240	So, is there somebody at QA saying, how do you play the game?
2594240	2595240	They're kind of relying on you.
2596240	2597240	So, then you talk to the dev team.
2598240	2600240	The dev team goes like, X is crouch and Y is jump.
2601240	2602240	And then you go, X is crouch and Y is jump.
2602240	2606240	You type that up and then the QA person goes like, that's not clear enough.
2607240	2608240	What does that mean?
2609240	2610240	Is that the process?
2611240	2621240	No, because what happens is, especially if you have, depending on the demographic that you're dealing with, it's like maybe they might not be very well versed in games.
2622240	2630240	So, what you have to do is kind of like show them, you know, this is, you know, it's like, how do you get out of Hannah Montana's tour bus?
2631240	2634240	Shout out to Hannah Montana, the movie video game.
2635240	2636240	I heard it out there, so yeah.
2637240	2641240	You're saying that particular consumer may, you know, we should probably cast a wider net in terms of explanation.
2642240	2643240	Right, right, right, exactly.
2644240	2648240	So, that's kind of, that's you write that to make that crowd kind of figure out.
2649240	2650240	Rob, what are you doing?
2651240	2652240	He's going to lesson.
2653240	2654240	Stay here.
2655240	2656240	I think the phone might be charged.
2657240	2661240	What's that, that's not, that's, you're on a show.
2662240	2664240	Who are you, are you going to make phone calls?
2665240	2666240	I just, I don't want to forget it.
2667240	2669240	It's in the charger right now, and I wanted to...
2670240	2671240	Sit, sit.
2672240	2673240	Well, you sit.
2674240	2675240	Do you want me to get you your phone?
2676240	2677240	I'm close.
2678240	2680240	Here's your phone. It's got a Legos on it.
2682240	2683240	Adorable.
2684240	2686240	I was trying to escape the episode.
2687240	2688240	All right, anyways.
2689240	2690240	I was just going to sneak off, do a quick sneak.
2691240	2692240	What's on your phone that you needed to interrupt?
2694240	2695240	I don't want to forget it.
2698240	2699240	He was trying to leave.
2700240	2703240	No, I wasn't trying to leave. My phone was there. I wasn't making up that...
2704240	2705240	I can hear you.
2706240	2712240	I wasn't making up an excuse. I just felt like, I was trying not to still focus.
2714240	2718240	By, by standing up and creeping off the stage?
2723240	2729240	What is the, what's the hardest video game you've ever had to write a manual for?
2731240	2736240	That definitely has to be, uh, Lizzie McGuire on the go.
2739240	2741240	That was the hardest one you ever had to do.
2741240	2743240	What was the, what was the biggest challenge of Lizzie McGuire?
2744240	2745240	For the user.
2746240	2751240	How many lockers you can open in that school and show people how to do that?
2752240	2753240	What's the answer?
2756240	2757240	The answer is...
2758240	2759240	I don't know what the answer is.
2760240	2762240	The answer was six, but anyways, but that's done.
2763240	2764240	That's a lot of lockers.
2765240	2769240	Why does, what's, what's the game play in Lizzie McGuire? I don't even know what that means.
2770240	2772240	It's a girl runs around and she just goes through people's shit?
2773240	2774240	Yes.
2775240	2777240	I shit you not. That's exactly what it is.
2778240	2780240	I remember a poster for a movie about her.
2786240	2795240	And she was kind of leaping in the air and, uh, she had like a pair of kids on and, uh, I think maybe she was going to Europe or...
2796240	2797240	She seemed very happy about it.
2797240	2800240	Her arms were outstretched. She was wearing a cashmere sweater.
2801240	2803240	How was it revealed that she was going to Europe in the poster?
2804240	2806240	I think Big Ben was in the background and the title was Lizzie McGuire Goes to Europe.
2807240	2810240	It sounds like she's running away from Europe if it's in the background.
2812240	2817240	I mean, if her arms are outstretched and Big Ben's behind her, she's trying to escape.
2818240	2820240	Get me out of Europe. Or at least out of England.
2820240	2821240	Right.
2823240	2826240	Anyways, seemed like a good role model for kids.
2828240	2831240	I took an interest while I was driving by.
2832240	2833240	She looks like a good kid.
2836240	2837240	Oh, wow.
2838240	2839240	Kim Possible also, uh...
2840240	2841240	Wow, Kim Possible.
2842240	2843240	Wow, I worked on Kim Possible.
2844240	2848240	Remember that E-Shurance commercial girl?
2849240	2852240	With the pink hair? Remember them? Remember them?
2853240	2860240	You know why they stopped? I read this on the Facebook this weekend in between renders.
2861240	2868240	They stopped doing those commercials because people kept doing fake porn of her because she was just too sexy.
2870240	2876240	Right. So, yeah, so the person who makes money if people are interested in that image said,
2877240	2881240	Oh, that's enough. Who stepped in?
2882240	2884240	It doesn't make any sense.
2885240	2887240	Did someone write to E-Shurance and say,
2888240	2895240	I just Googled E-Shurance girl rule 34 porn and I found too many hits.
2896240	2899240	So I'm not going to use your insurance unless you use a different spokesmodel.
2900240	2901240	That's exactly what happened.
2902240	2903240	Okay.
2904240	2909240	Seems to me that they would be excited.
2910240	2911240	Some people were.
2914240	2924240	Have you ever successfully reached completion watching rule 34 porn?
2925240	2926240	What's rule 34?
2926240	2935240	It's usually animated porn. I think rule 34 is the mythical internet rule.
2936240	2941240	What is it? If you can conceive of it or what's the if it exists, there's porn of it.
2942240	2944240	So Ronald McDonald, there's porn of it.
2945240	2948240	Why 34 just because it sounds like a random number.
2949240	2950240	Okay.
2951240	2953240	I'm going to say yes.
2954240	2958240	I got confused about rule 34. What was your question to him, Dan?
2959240	2961240	Did he ever like finish like watching any of it?
2962240	2964240	You know, in a world where there's nothing but porn available.
2965240	2968240	I did it once too. Velma and Shaggy.
2971240	2972240	There was porn of Velma and Shaggy?
2973240	2974240	She has a lot.
2975240	2976240	No, there's porn of Fred and Daphne.
2984240	2985240	Yeah. Give me a break.
2986240	2990240	Because everybody wanted to be with Ginger on Gilligan's Island, right? Not Marianne?
2991240	2993240	No. Yeah. Of course there's porn of Velma and Shaggy.
2994240	2996240	Did you stumble across this or were you?
2997240	2998240	No, I fucking typed it in.
3001240	3002240	You better believe it.
3003240	3004240	And I was proud of myself because I found.
3005240	3008240	How good was the quality? Did it look like Scooby-Doo?
3008240	3015240	It wasn't so good that it wasn't interesting to me that I like met it halfway.
3016240	3019240	You know what I mean? Like it was bad enough that I was like, something's going on here with me.
3020240	3021240	Right now.
3022240	3025240	Like it wasn't high quality and I was like, still, I was like, I want this.
3026240	3029240	Was it just like Gonzo, just Shaggy and?
3030240	3032240	There's a lot of like cartoon porn where it's like they'll just like some
3032240	3038240	enterprising youth will just use his like toon boom skills or his whatever.
3039240	3045240	Like he'll just take existing cartoons and then he'll kind of like, you know, mask out heads
3046240	3048240	and then like put a dick in the mouth instead.
3049240	3050240	Was there storytelling to it? Was there like refusing to call it?
3051240	3052240	Yeah, a little tiny bit.
3053240	3056240	Like usually it'll be like the beginning of a cartoon where it's like,
3057240	3061240	like Shaggy, you said we were going to watch a movie.
3062240	3065240	Well, Zoinks, I thought we'd solve a mystery instead.
3066240	3067240	And then all of a sudden it's just like...
3067240	3068240	Woah, woah.
3074240	3075240	Jinkies.
3078240	3079240	Zoinks.
3081240	3082240	Zoinks.
3083240	3084240	Zoinks.
3085240	3087240	It's like the same Zoinks and the same Jinkies.
3088240	3090240	But it got me where I was going.
3092240	3093240	Where were you going?
3093240	3096240	After a lifetime of like, I didn't know, I didn't know I wanted it.
3097240	3098240	Okay.
3098240	3100240	I'm a sucker for a Velma for sure.
3100240	3101240	Yeah.
3105240	3108240	I met a girl in somewhere like one of those...
3108240	3109240	Where are you going Rob?
3109240	3110240	Rob!
3110240	3111240	Stay down.
3114240	3117240	Yeah, I met a girl that looked so much like Velma once that it was pretty hot.
3117240	3119240	She really was a Velma.
3119240	3121240	And her friend looked just like Daphne.
3122240	3124240	They weren't doing that on purpose.
3125240	3127240	I think it's the turtleneck most of all.
3130240	3134240	What makes it sexy that Shaggy was the one?
3134240	3135240	Oh, nothing.
3135240	3136240	Just because...
3136240	3138240	You don't relate to Fred.
3138240	3139240	Right.
3145240	3148240	Yeah, he's dirty, like she's supposed to...
3148240	3150240	Yeah, he likes sandwiches.
3150240	3152240	I was always worried about...
3153240	3155240	I loved a big sandwich.
3155240	3157240	I was always so fucking bummed out.
3157240	3158240	He likes sandwiches.
3158240	3159240	Oh, in the news today.
3160240	3163240	They would make these stoner, like four foot tall sandwiches,
3163240	3166240	and they'd put the toothpick with the olive on top,
3166240	3167240	and they would eat the whole thing.
3167240	3170240	I was always so bummed out about the toothpick being in there.
3170240	3171240	You're scared.
3171240	3172240	You're gonna kill yourself.
3172240	3174240	You're gonna fucking eat a toothpick.
3175240	3177240	You can't feed a chicken bone to a dog,
3177240	3179240	so you're gonna give Scooby a fucking toothpick.
3179240	3180240	Yeah, can't do that.
3180240	3182240	You shouldn't do it.
3182240	3184240	It was distracting to me.
3184240	3186240	I love a sandwich.
3186240	3188240	I wouldn't jerk off to...
3188240	3194240	Do you think there's slash porn world 34 Scooby fucking Velma?
3194240	3195240	Yes, there's gotta be.
3195240	3198240	There's definitely drawings of it there is for sure.
3199240	3203240	The actual animation, the more work required,
3203240	3205240	I think that's the point of porn.
3205240	3208240	There's a laziness to everything.
3208240	3213240	That's why the old cinematic porn is a lost art.
3213240	3215240	It's found porn.
3215240	3218240	Yeah, it's really going downhill.
3218240	3229240	Man, this new porn is really getting me down.
3229240	3233240	It's not as cinematic as it used to be.
3235240	3237240	Shit.
3238240	3241240	So Fred, what were you doing when we ran into each other
3241240	3243240	across the bar from the red berry?
3243240	3244240	Oh, wow, I just came to...
3244240	3246240	Oh, the red berry.
3248240	3249240	I love this.
3249240	3253240	Have some peppermints before you go into the red berry.
3253240	3256240	They're delicious.
3256240	3260240	Jerome, Jerome, come into my office right now.
3260240	3261240	Pardon me.
3261240	3265240	You could take these mints and go in and talk to my manager.
3265240	3267240	Yes.
3267240	3271240	Jerome, you're doing a bang up job here at the red berry.
3273240	3274240	I like your style, Jerome.
3274240	3275240	Thank you.
3275240	3276240	Thank you very much.
3276240	3277240	I got a call from the front office.
3277240	3279240	They're looking for a guy like you.
3279240	3280240	Yeah.
3280240	3281240	We're kicking you upstairs.
3281240	3282240	Oh, shit.
3282240	3283240	Yeah.
3284240	3288240	Get your own bags, fuckhead.
3288240	3291240	I'm going upstairs.
3291240	3292240	Oh.
3292240	3293240	Oh, he's going upstairs.
3293240	3295240	Look at him.
3298240	3300240	Wow.
3303240	3306240	Oh, I must be in the front row here.
3306240	3309240	Welcome to the upstairs.
3309240	3312240	Yes, I'll have the...
3312240	3321240	The upstairs is the code word for the freezer containing human nutrition.
3321240	3325240	And I don't mean nutrition for humans.
3325240	3330240	I mean nutrition composed of humans.
3330240	3333240	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
3333240	3337240	F217, get in my office for a second.
3337240	3340240	F217, Jerome, say where you are.
3340240	3341240	Don't shit the door.
3341240	3342240	Say it.
3342240	3343240	Jerome, just sit still.
3343240	3344240	It's very chilly.
3344240	3346240	F217, get in my upstairs office.
3346240	3347240	I'm about to order dinner.
3347240	3350240	Come into my upstairs office.
3350240	3355240	F217, is everything okay at home?
3355240	3360240	You just seem really on edge lately.
3360240	3364240	My home is satisfactory.
3364240	3367240	I have a wife and child.
3367240	3374240	However, when I say wife, I mean synthetic wife,
3374240	3379240	a corpse animated of dead human flesh,
3379240	3384240	laced with fiber optic cables instead of nerve endings.
3384240	3388240	F217, you have to go talk to Susan in HR
3388240	3391240	because this kind of behavior is really not what we're doing here
3391240	3392240	at the Red Bay.
3392240	3394240	F217.
3394240	3397240	Anybody, Susan?
3397240	3399240	Susan, Susan, Susan, talk to F217.
3399240	3400240	I'm going to go back downstairs
3400240	3403240	and see if Mr. Oliva is doing okay down at home.
3403240	3407240	F217.
3407240	3408240	That's you, right?
3408240	3410240	You're Susan now.
3410240	3412240	I think the scene should follow.
3412240	3413240	You go to talk to Fred.
3413240	3415240	Oh, I'm going back downstairs?
3415240	3416240	Oh, okay.
3416240	3418240	Mr. Oliva, I'm very sorry.
3418240	3421240	We're going through some transitional stuff here at the Red Bay.
3421240	3424240	That was a very pleasurable detour, by the way.
3424240	3428240	Mr. Oliva, I hope it's not too forward.
3428240	3430240	Your room, you checked in a little bit early.
3430240	3432240	Checking generally is 3 o'clock here.
3432240	3434240	It's 1.30 p.m.
3434240	3438240	Maybe we can interest you in a drink in our lounge.
3438240	3443240	This is not really an offer so much as a demand, Mr. Oliva.
3443240	3445240	Yeah, yeah, yeah, Lemon Drop would be great.
3445240	3447240	Okay, Lemon Drop.
3447240	3449240	All right.
3449240	3451240	I'll be right back.
3451240	3455240	You must remember this.
3455240	3459240	Sam, you told me you were not going to play that song.
3459240	3461240	Goddamn it, Fred Oliva just walked in.
3461240	3464240	Of all the hotels in all of the West Hollywoods,
3464240	3467240	Fred Oliva had to walk into mine.
3467240	3471240	He left me stranded on a plane platform in Paris.
3471240	3479240	Here's your Lemon Drop, sir.
3479240	3482240	Carol, come into my office.
3482240	3484240	One second.
3484240	3486240	Carol, Jesus Christ.
3486240	3489240	Carol, are you using again?
3489240	3491240	What the fuck are you on, Carol?
3491240	3494240	I just needed a bunch to get through this afternoon.
3494240	3495240	Oh, Carol, no.
3495240	3498240	I've got a serious problem, but I'm not trying.
3498240	3501240	Carol, I'll give you one more package, but this is your last one.
3501240	3503240	Thank you, sir.
3503240	3505240	Just pull it together.
3505240	3509240	God, if I weren't old college buddies with your father,
3509240	3511240	you would never even have this job, Carol.
3511240	3514240	Okay. God bless you.
3514240	3518240	God bless you.
3518240	3520240	Is there anything else you want to press?
3520240	3521240	Oh, there's some shit on it.
3521240	3523240	I'm sorry.
3523240	3525240	Okay, all right.
3525240	3535240	Should I put it on your room or something?
3535240	3536240	Didn't catch that.
3536240	3540240	What's the room number?
3540240	3542240	Don't put it on your room.
3542240	3544240	Put it on mine.
3544240	3552240	Oh, shit. It's the mayor.
3552240	3555240	Everybody run.
3555240	3558240	Fucking mayor.
3558240	3561240	That's the last I expect to see of you, Carol.
3561240	3562240	You know what I mean.
3562240	3569240	I'm hiding in the snake basket.
3569240	3571240	Bunch of laundry in here.
3571240	3574240	That's not what this is for.
3574240	3577240	Clearly says snake basket.
3577240	3580240	Can you hand me the lid?
3580240	3581240	Thank you. Thank you.
3581240	3582240	Okay.
3582240	3584240	I hope I come over to that basket.
3584240	3588240	I don't find you've been doing that shit anymore.
3588240	3589240	Yeah, that's what I thought.
3589240	3591240	Oh, oh, oh, Mr. Mayor.
3591240	3593240	Mr. Mayor, we expected you on Thursday.
3593240	3594240	I didn't know you.
3594240	3596240	We didn't expect you so soon.
3596240	3600240	I follow the advice of Mr. Charles Schultz.
3600240	3606240	Draw peanuts.
3606240	3610240	Be surprised.
3610240	3612240	Oh, very good, Mr. Mayor.
3612240	3614240	I'll leave you and Mr. Leave it alone.
3614240	3617240	It means arrive early to check up on the subordinates.
3617240	3621240	I think the meaning was implicit.
3621240	3624240	Your peanuts will be right out?
3624240	3628240	Okay.
3628240	3630240	Carol! Carol, get out of the snake basket.
3630240	3635240	I'm so fucking high.
3636240	3640240	Mr. Oliva, may I speak to you in the corner booth?
3640240	3641240	By all means, pal.
3641240	3643240	Taking off my shirt.
3643240	3645240	You'll have to excuse the redberry.
3645240	3648240	As of late, it's gone downhill.
3648240	3651240	I still believe in it for privacy's sake.
3651240	3655240	Have a seat.
3655240	3658240	Mr. Oliva, I'll be to the point where both busy men...
3658240	3664240	We are.
3664240	3669240	Get those dollars out, gentlemen.
3669240	3670240	Never thought I'd say it.
3670240	3674240	Carol to the stage.
3674240	3677240	She's got to get off that shit.
3677240	3681240	I'm going to put a lit candle up my ass.
3681240	3686240	It's Mondays at the redberry.
3686240	3689240	Every Monday.
3689240	3692240	Lemon drops are, for the next 45 minutes,
3692240	3695240	lemon drops are in half off.
3695240	3698240	Mr. Oliva, you are one of the best
3698240	3701240	technical manual writers in video game history.
3701240	3702240	Thank you, thank you.
3702240	3704240	High praise, high praise indeed.
3704240	3706240	I run a city.
3706240	3708240	I don't know video games.
3708240	3711240	I don't know technical writing.
3711240	3713240	I know craftsmanship.
3713240	3717240	And I know fascism.
3718240	3723240	The latter is, I've got it handled.
3723240	3726240	The former, sir, I have not seen the like of
3726240	3731240	since looking into your eyes at the G4 Summit.
3731240	3734240	When you press that business card into my hand...
3734240	3736240	Now, I've been crunching the numbers,
3736240	3741240	and I've been seeing the lights.
3741240	3743240	And I've got a proposition for you.
3744240	3748240	What if the whole city were a video game?
3748240	3751240	Like SimCity.
3753240	3756240	Well, if it's been done, then fuck it.
3756240	3758240	I what? All right.
3758240	3761240	Pardon, Mr. Oliva, Mr. Mayor.
3764240	3766240	I asked for privacy over here.
3766240	3768240	Don't leave me. I'm so lonely.
3768240	3769240	Please don't leave me.
3769240	3771240	I have no way home.
3771240	3775240	Carol and I would like to take Mr. Mayor and Mr. Oliva...
3775240	3777240	We'd like to take you upstairs for a moment.
3777240	3780240	We have something rather important to discuss.
3780240	3781240	No problem, no problem.
3781240	3783240	Mr. Oliva, Mr. Oliva,
3783240	3786240	what if what I proposed to you is actually happening right now?
3786240	3788240	What if this is all a simulation? Go.
3788240	3790240	F-2-7!
3793240	3795240	No!
3796240	3798240	F-2-1-7!
3798240	3799240	F-2-1-7!
3799240	3801240	Your directors were not to kill the mayor.
3801240	3804240	My orders were to accommodate him.
3804240	3806240	He needed accoutrements.
3806240	3812240	My accoutrements include a bullet fired out of a gun!
3815240	3818240	I reveal twists with every active...
3818240	3820240	F-2-1-7! F-2-1-7!
3820240	3822240	I'm going to give you the week off.
3822240	3824240	I want you to go home.
3824240	3827240	You're suspended from the Redberry for a while.
3828240	3830240	Carol, Carol, go get some rags.
3830240	3833240	We have to clean up the mayor's corpse.
3833240	3835240	I need a ride home.
3835240	3838240	He goes right by where I live.
3838240	3841240	If you're sending him home, I mean, I could really use...
3841240	3844240	Carol, you take Mr. Oliva home?
3844240	3845240	No.
3845240	3848240	The robot, he's driving by my...
3848240	3849240	F-2-1-7?
3849240	3852240	The only robot I'm pointing at!
3852240	3856240	F-2-1-7! Get Carol the fuck out of here!
3856240	3859240	Okay, I called you both an Uber.
3859240	3862240	I live in a very peaceful neighborhood.
3862240	3866240	It is peaceful because there is zero crime.
3866240	3871240	It has zero crime because we have redefined crime.
3871240	3875240	Once per year, we eliminate rape and murder from our systems
3875240	3879240	by engaging in it wholesale!
3879240	3882240	We enjoy it so much, we are peaceful!
3882240	3885240	I am F-1-2-7.
3885240	3888240	F-2-1-7!
3893240	3897240	The crazy thing about that improv is that shit could happen.
3899240	3901240	It might still be happening.
3901240	3903240	Fred, it's still happening.
3903240	3906240	This is all a simulation.
3906240	3909240	I'll write about it.
3909240	3912240	But you'll be being written about while you do it.
3912240	3914240	You just blew my mind.
3914240	3918240	What you'll be writing is press X to control Fred.
3918240	3922240	Then you'll look over your shoulder and there will be a giant Fred going...
3922240	3925240	Or a Carol.
3928240	3932240	This is all in your manual, Fred.
3934240	3937240	Is there anything you'd like to plug?
3937240	3941240	Do you have a trade paperback of video game instructions?
3941240	3943240	I'd like to plug my band, Superbing.
3943240	3946240	Oh yeah, you're in a band.
3946240	3948240	Super Bean?
3948240	3950240	Super Bean.
3950240	3952240	There's human beings and there's super beings.
3952240	3954240	Oh, there's a bean, like a bean.
3954240	3956240	Yeah, that's correct.
3956240	3958240	Write it down.
3958240	3960240	There's a bean, there's a human being.
3960240	3961240	Where do you guys play it next?
3961240	3963240	We're playing Cafe Nila.
3963240	3965240	Hopefully March.
3965240	3966240	What's your opener?
3966240	3968240	What are you opening with?
3968240	3970240	What do you mean?
3970240	3971240	Are you an opening song?
3971240	3972240	It's a super bean theme.
3972240	3974240	Let's hear it for Super Bean.
3977240	3979240	What are you closing with?
3979240	3981240	What is your closing song?
3981240	3982240	Do you guys do any covers?
3982240	3983240	Do you guys do any covers?
3983240	3985240	The Super Bean Reprise.
3985240	3986240	For real?
3986240	3988240	You guys don't know any fog hat?
3991240	3993240	Wow, I love fog hat.
3995240	4001240	Alright, well, let's all graciously thank Fred for opening his life to us.
4003240	4006240	That's what it's like to be a technical writer in a video game.
4006240	4009240	Hopefully there's a seat among your friends out there.
4009240	4014240	I hope you don't have to go back and sit the bell free.
4014240	4016240	But, I don't know.
4016240	4018240	See, Fred, that music means leave.
4018240	4020240	Oh, sorry.
4020240	4023240	Sorry, I didn't...
4023240	4026240	Or stay, or stay.
4026240	4028240	But, yeah, incredibly...
4029240	4031240	I was just wondering.
4031240	4034240	I suppose there's probably not a seat for him among his friends.
4034240	4036240	The word leave is in his name.
4036240	4040240	He had a bunch of friends who came.
4040240	4044240	I was wondering if there was a seat among them for him, but there probably isn't.
4044240	4048240	So now I feel bad for our guests because then they have to go and sit in the closet for the rest of the show.
4048240	4050240	When they have friends that come.
4050240	4051240	Yeah.
4051240	4052240	He had a big posse in the green room.
4052240	4053240	There was a whole team of people.
4053240	4054240	And they're all watching the show.
4054240	4055240	And now they're friends off stage.
4055240	4057240	And they're friends in a closet.
4057240	4060240	And he can't sit in the show.
4060240	4061240	What?
4061240	4062240	I think about these things.
4062240	4063240	Should we have him sit over there?
4063240	4064240	Oh, yeah, he can sit at Spencer's.
4064240	4065240	Fred, I'll leave it. Get back out of here.
4065240	4066240	Fred?
4066240	4067240	That's perfect.
4067240	4068240	Fred, you're brilliant.
4068240	4069240	Fred, where are you?
4069240	4070240	Fred, go sit by Spencer's seat.
4070240	4071240	Yeah, you can sit there.
4071240	4072240	And now you have a seat at the show.
4078240	4079240	That's perfect.
4079240	4080240	I don't have a 20-sided tie.
4080240	4083240	He might actually make a good game master because he writes explanations.
4083240	4085240	He's literally a master of games.
4086240	4089240	Fred, do you ever play any role-playing games?
4089240	4092240	Like pen and paper kind of stuff?
4092240	4095240	Yes, I don't talk about that in public.
4096240	4099240	Wow, you're a real rich tapestry man.
4100240	4103240	Rob, we're in the room.
4109240	4110240	What are you doing?
4110240	4112240	He's scrolling through something.
4112240	4114240	It looks like he's just picking a date.
4114240	4117240	It doesn't even look like he's doing anything.
4117240	4118240	Instagram or Facebook?
4119240	4122240	I told somebody I would give him a shout-out,
4122240	4125240	and I want to make sure that I give him a shout-out right.
4125240	4127240	Shout-out to the most memorable person in the world.
4127240	4128240	Oh, don't do that.
4130240	4131240	You're very important.
4131240	4133240	I can't say it now.
4134240	4135240	It's serious.
4135240	4137240	Oh, are you seeing somebody?
4139240	4140240	Yes.
4141240	4142240	Are you seeing me?
4142240	4143240	No.
4145240	4149240	Remember a couple weeks ago,
4149240	4152240	you made me feel real bad for missing your birthday?
4152240	4153240	Yeah.
4154240	4155240	I'm sorry.
4159240	4161240	Jeff, did you go to last birthday?
4161240	4162240	I was out of town.
4162240	4163240	He was out of town.
4164240	4166240	He texted me, happy birthday, though.
4170240	4171240	I bought him bathrobes.
4172240	4174240	When are you leaving for Vancouver?
4178240	4179240	What?
4180240	4182240	The beginning of 2017.
4185240	4186240	That long?
4187240	4188240	That long?
4188240	4189240	Yeah, that's a long ways away.
4189240	4190240	Yeah, that's a long ways away.
4190240	4191240	You're away.
4192240	4195240	So you'll have another birthday between now and when you leave?
4195240	4196240	Yeah.
4196240	4198240	So we'll make it the best one ever.
4199240	4200240	All right.
4201240	4202240	Moving on.
4202240	4203240	We've got a lot of show to cover.
4205240	4213240	Our next guest is very handsome and debonair.
4213240	4215240	He always gets all dressed up.
4215240	4219240	He's getting an extra sexy haircut lately,
4219240	4221240	and he's always here.
4221240	4225240	We're very comforted by his face and his voice,
4225240	4227240	and we wish him the best of luck.
4228240	4230240	He has some terrible news for us tonight.
4230240	4231240	No, he doesn't.
4231240	4232240	I'm kidding.
4233240	4234240	Demarge Brown.
4234240	4235240	Demarge Brown!
4236240	4238240	That shit is so rich, man.
4238240	4239240	It's done.
4241240	4243240	He got nothing planned for Sunday.
4246240	4247240	I don't want to talk to you.
4247240	4248240	I don't want to.
4250240	4251240	What's up, Demarge?
4251240	4252240	Not much.
4252240	4255240	Can I talk to you about physical fitness for a little bit?
4255240	4256240	All you want.
4256240	4257240	Have you been working out?
4258240	4259240	Yes.
4259240	4260240	So I always do, though.
4260240	4261240	But were you ever fat?
4262240	4265240	Oh, yeah, no.
4266240	4267240	I was uncoordinated.
4267240	4268240	Yeah, I was like...
4269240	4270240	If you lifted up your shirt right now,
4270240	4274240	would there be like a Peter Parker kind of like six-pack?
4274240	4275240	Absolutely not.
4275240	4278240	It would just be a flat, delicious...
4278240	4281240	Have you ever had abs, like six-pack abs?
4281240	4282240	Yeah, most of the time.
4282240	4283240	Most of the time?
4283240	4284240	For real?
4284240	4286240	But you know, I played soccer like as a kid,
4286240	4289240	and if you, by luck of the draw,
4289240	4291240	because my brain wasn't like those kids
4291240	4292240	that are just naturally athletic.
4292240	4294240	But I just love playing and stuff.
4294240	4296240	So you ascend pretty high.
4296240	4299240	And at a certain level, you're getting basically pro trainers.
4299240	4302240	You're 11, and the guys that are training you are professionals.
4302240	4306240	So you're getting like that kind of mental conditioning that gets you, you know.
4306240	4309240	They basically take the stuff that most people kind of look at running and go,
4309240	4310240	I don't want to do that shit.
4310240	4311240	Well, can you give Dan some pointers?
4311240	4313240	Because Dan was saying the other day that you're...
4313240	4315240	Ah, the pointer is exercise and get a trainer and stuff.
4315240	4318240	Well, but it's also about like mentally how you do it.
4318240	4319240	They tricked us one time.
4319240	4324240	There was a level where they said everybody there at this camp wanted to be,
4324240	4326240	wanted to stay on this team.
4326240	4330240	But the main requirement was that when they timed your runs,
4330240	4333240	you had to come in under a certain number of minutes on this one run.
4333240	4336240	It would be the longest run that you've done at this pace ever.
4336240	4339240	And so for the first two weeks, they just let you stew with this fear
4339240	4342240	that you were going to, you know, not make the grade and have to go home
4342240	4345240	instead of spending the entire summer running around traveling places
4345240	4346240	and having fun.
4346240	4351240	And we did a run right before it where nobody felt good
4351240	4354240	and everybody was dogging, everybody was just, you know, dying.
4354240	4355240	I was looking at people as we were running going,
4355240	4357240	what the fuck is wrong with me?
4357240	4359240	Because we just felt horrible.
4359240	4360240	And at the end of the run, the guy was like,
4360240	4366240	so you guys think that that was a pretty bad run,
4366240	4369240	surfaces where everything was, all the conditions were optimal,
4369240	4370240	you should have run better.
4370240	4374240	But what you guys don't know is that you ran not the four required time miles,
4374240	4375240	but you ran eight.
4375240	4377240	We just didn't tell you what you were doing.
4377240	4378240	See, it's dishonest.
4378240	4380240	And it's just like, but it was just a physical fitness.
4380240	4381240	It's dishonest.
4381240	4383240	That's like the aerobics ladies.
4383240	4387240	They always go, and 10, 9, 8, and 11, and 7.
4387240	4388240	That's Rosie O'Donnell.
4388240	4391240	Well, it's like that guy in the gym too was looking at his friend
4391240	4392240	when they're lifting weights and he's going,
4392240	4394240	come on, do one more, one more, one more.
4394240	4396240	But it's the same as the director who says last take.
4396240	4397240	I do like that relationship.
4397240	4400240	A lot of guys, they have personal trainers,
4400240	4404240	and then they have these kind of, they're pretty important relationships.
4404240	4409240	I have one friend who's gay, and who I swear to God,
4409240	4414240	and he has a personal trainer, and the guy is straight,
4414240	4418240	and the trainer's straight, but he's hot,
4418240	4420240	and he's always like, when you're a trainer,
4420240	4426240	you're servicing, you're hitting all these buttons emotionally.
4426240	4431240	You're saying to this guy everything that a guy would want to hear
4431240	4434240	if he wanted to be romantically involved with a guy.
4434240	4436240	You're like the wind beneath that guy's wings.
4436240	4437240	You're going like, you're the best.
4437240	4440240	You're the fucking best.
4440240	4444240	It's really weird because there's a whole, it's LA,
4444240	4450240	and so a lot of these trainers are straight, and they're actors,
4450240	4453240	and they want to work in the industry, and then they're training.
4453240	4456240	English comes to shove.
4456240	4461240	A lot of very powerful gay men getting physically trained
4461240	4463240	by guys that they know are straight,
4463240	4466240	and it's very interesting to just hear about these things.
4466240	4471240	I have a trainer I go to very infrequently,
4471240	4472240	and he's really, really funny.
4472240	4475240	He's a black guy, and he calls me the N-word constantly.
4475240	4479240	I would pay a million dollars for that.
4479240	4482240	If that can be a part of exercise, I didn't know that was...
4482240	4483240	I know.
4483240	4485240	Are you fucking kidding me?
4485240	4488240	He keeps calling everybody the N-word,
4488240	4492240	he calls me the N-word the most, and then...
4492240	4493240	That's what he's saying.
4493240	4494240	He probably makes you the happiest.
4494240	4495240	The other day...
4495240	4496240	Wait, this guy's your trainer?
4496240	4497240	Yeah, he's great.
4497240	4498240	Wait, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.
4498240	4499240	Oh, you got to do it.
4499240	4502240	Is he going to just say that over and lifting?
4502240	4503240	Come on, did he call me that?
4503240	4506240	He also recommends that you come to work out a little high.
4506240	4507240	He wants you...
4507240	4509240	It's like, smoke a little bit of weed before you...
4509240	4511240	And a little late, because he wants all the stereotypes.
4511240	4514240	He wants to lean into them.
4514240	4515240	Okay, so now you're going too far.
4515240	4516240	All right.
4516240	4521240	But when it's leg day, I have a little skinny chicken legs,
4521240	4523240	and so we do legs and I can't walk.
4523240	4526240	We do a dance called the wonky honky,
4526240	4531240	and we do the wonky honky leg day dance.
4531240	4533240	Well, see, I don't want the whole like,
4533240	4536240	oh, come on, white boy, you're pretty good for a white boy.
4536240	4537240	No, no, no.
4537240	4539240	He calls you nigger the whole time.
4539240	4541240	You don't have to say it.
4541240	4542240	It's hilarious.
4542240	4543240	What's with an A, right?
4543240	4544240	What's with an A, right?
4544240	4545240	I want to be...
4545240	4546240	I want to like...
4546240	4549240	I'm open.
4549240	4552240	I want DMX to yell it at me.
4552240	4553240	Yeah.
4553240	4557240	Number one, number two, number three, do it.
4557240	4559240	That would be amazing.
4559240	4561240	It wouldn't feel fraudulent.
4561240	4563240	It would feel like empowerment to me.
4563240	4565240	Because he'd be like, fuck me.
4565240	4566240	You're going to fucking do it.
4566240	4568240	As much as we're laughing, because he's so...
4568240	4569240	I've known Scott forever.
4569240	4570240	We're good friends.
4570240	4571240	He's fucking hilarious.
4571240	4574240	Also, like, you will want to barf in the middle of it,
4574240	4575240	because it's like really hard going.
4575240	4577240	But like, he keeps it fun and buoyant,
4577240	4578240	and it's always different.
4578240	4579240	It's very good stuff.
4579240	4580240	Oh, man.
4580240	4583240	I mean, I'm picturing him as DMX.
4583240	4584240	I don't know.
4584240	4587240	It sounds like that's just the idea of like the validation
4587240	4588240	that you would be...
4588240	4591240	It would be like, come on, you fucking...
4591240	4592240	Yeah.
4592240	4594240	Yeah.
4594240	4595240	One of the...
4595240	4598240	We're at a new gym now, because he moved to a different gym.
4598240	4600240	So it's the first time I went there.
4600240	4603240	There's this other trainer who looks like Cypress Hill,
4603240	4606240	like he's like an Irish guy with a big red beard.
4606240	4609240	And he walks up, and he walks up to Phil.
4609240	4611240	He goes, Phil, stop looking at the white women.
4611240	4612240	That's a joke.
4612240	4615240	And he goes, oh, man, you guys are all racist.
4615240	4619240	You've been calling everybody the N-word the entire time.
4619240	4622240	Everybody is just hurling fake racism at each other
4622240	4623240	the whole time.
4623240	4624240	It's really good.
4624240	4625240	I just want the N-word.
4625240	4628240	I don't want any of this stuff.
4628240	4630240	I don't want to be a party to anything.
4630240	4634240	I want to be called that word sincerely.
4634240	4635240	He's your man.
4635240	4636240	He's your man.
4636240	4640240	Remember when we were kids in Milwaukee?
4640240	4645240	Rob's been bald since the 70s.
4645240	4646240	Nineteen.
4646240	4647240	Nineteen.
4647240	4650240	And before Bruce Willis was in Pulp Fiction,
4651240	4655240	and before Patrick Stewart was the captain of the enterprise,
4655240	4659240	and when Rob was 22,
4659240	4663240	there wasn't a lot of pride involved in Milwaukee
4663240	4666240	with the losing of the hair.
4666240	4670240	I was friends with him when he was going through a weird phase
4670240	4672240	where it was hitting critical mass.
4672240	4675240	He had a girlfriend who made it clear
4675240	4679240	that it wouldn't be a bad idea for him to go get a toupee.
4680240	4684240	He went through the whole motion of that.
4688240	4689240	He can talk about that in a second,
4689240	4692240	but the thing that I remember you being so excited about,
4692240	4694240	because there was that day,
4694240	4697240	I think it was when Pulp Fiction came out
4697240	4700240	because it's like all of a sudden balding men in cinema
4700240	4701240	just started like...
4701240	4702240	It's fucking hot.
4702240	4703240	Instead of like...
4703240	4704240	So hot.
4704240	4707240	It went from Hudson Hawk where it was CG hair
4707240	4709240	and then it was like Pulp Fiction where,
4709240	4713240	even if you had fucking receding hair,
4713240	4715240	you just fucking shave it off.
4715240	4717240	What's more virile than that?
4717240	4718240	And so all of a sudden,
4718240	4721240	and then Rob got all excited and came in,
4721240	4722240	I can't remember where we were,
4722240	4723240	but you were like...
4723240	4727240	I was driving down Farwell and I was at a stoplight
4727240	4732240	and this big, scary looking black guy,
4732240	4733240	like the muscles,
4734240	4738240	and he looked like not a guy that would hang out with me.
4738240	4741240	And he's like yelling something at the car
4741240	4743240	and I'm like, oh God, now what?
4743240	4745240	And he rolled down the windows like, what?
4745240	4747240	What are you yelling at me?
4747240	4749240	And the guy said, I'm with you, brother.
4749240	4751240	Because he had shaved his head too.
4755240	4756240	That's awesome.
4758240	4760240	And he ran into sharing the story because it's like,
4760240	4762240	it's a visceral thing.
4763240	4767240	Attached to every little ugly,
4767240	4770240	terrible, racist thing, it's all this.
4770240	4772240	And to tie it all into porn.
4772240	4776240	Look how fucking unraciously racist porn is.
4777240	4781240	That's so crazy in an industry that just has no tact,
4781240	4783240	no accountability, nothing at all.
4783240	4786240	You would expect it to be a fetid wasteland
4786240	4788240	of fucking horrible racist shit.
4788240	4790240	The internet in general is, you could go to websites
4790240	4792240	and they're just like, oh, these are horrible charts,
4792240	4795240	and here's a presidential candidate just retweeting them.
4795240	4799240	But porn itself is just like, yeah, put that big black dick
4799240	4802240	and here's a big, but it's like, it's not like,
4802240	4805240	it doesn't, it doesn't, it treats race
4809240	4812240	as if it's like hair color or height or like,
4812240	4815240	it's like, oh, what are you into, you know?
4815240	4818240	And so it's all equivalent.
4818240	4821240	Who's yelling, yeah, put that big black dick.
4821240	4823240	In the room, it's like an announcer.
4823240	4824240	Probably Nick Manning.
4824240	4826240	Big black dick!
4829240	4833240	I'm always like, I always feel like as a child of the 70s,
4833240	4836240	whenever I see like interracial this or anything like that,
4836240	4838240	I always like brace myself for something
4838240	4841240	that's gonna like make me uncomfortable.
4841240	4844240	Like even in the privacy of my own bed,
4844240	4847240	like with my laptop open, I'm like still going like,
4847240	4850240	oh, don't, don't, don't make this awkward for me.
4850240	4853240	Like, like, like, but, but nine times out of 10,
4853240	4857240	it's simply just a celebration of like, like, like, whatever.
4857240	4859240	It's like, like, like people go to dark places when they're,
4859240	4861240	oh, that's a pun.
4861240	4863240	Didn't have to be, didn't have to be.
4863240	4865240	Didn't have to be.
4865240	4868240	People, people, people, people are just like fulfilling themselves
4868240	4870240	and it's like, like, like, like, it's like, there's a,
4870240	4872240	there's a line, like, like, like things that are like,
4872240	4875240	absolutely inappropriate that are like shielding terrible,
4875240	4878240	terrible, hateful feelings that you're being dishonest about.
4878240	4881240	And then you go to these crevices where people go to like,
4881240	4882240	just pleasure themselves.
4882240	4887240	These, these public toilets that we consider so non-sacred,
4887240	4890240	but it's, it's remarkable to me and notable to me
4890240	4896240	that you don't see like a lot of what you would qualify
4896240	4899240	as racism in these ridiculous circuses.
4899240	4901240	Although you see acknowledgement of race.
4901240	4902240	Well, okay.
4902240	4904240	So, counterpoint.
4904240	4909240	First of all, that stuff doesn't actually, it's not real.
4909240	4910240	So it's in there.
4910240	4913240	So you have people who are, people who are actively racist
4913240	4916240	indulging their sort of isolated fantasies and that stuff.
4916240	4922240	I mean, it's that, the fact that there's, this categories exist because.
4922240	4925240	Well, you mean like, well, let's be really specific though.
4925240	4929240	Because like, like, like, like, like, wouldn't you expect to see like,
4929240	4930240	I don't know.
4930240	4931240	Well, now I'm good.
4931240	4934240	If I riff an example, I'm just going to like fucking like.
4934240	4935240	Hit all the notes.
4935240	4940240	There's, there's, there's, uh, uh, Brazzers, which is basically just.
4940240	4941240	World famous.
4941240	4945240	But it's a, but it's a thing.
4945240	4946240	It's a touchstone.
4946240	4950240	It's a, it's a comedic touchstone because it's just, it literally is just
4950240	4954240	sanctioned violence against whoever is the, whether it's women,
4954240	4955240	usually it's women.
4955240	4957240	Uh, if it's black women, then it's black women.
4957240	4960240	Then you double by a power of two, the amount of horseshit that you're like
4960240	4966240	putting into, uh, into, into this, into this, this narrative, um, that is,
4966240	4967240	that is porn.
4967240	4971240	And it's, and it's, it, because you are, there's a tacit agreement that because
4971240	4974240	you're clicking into it and you're doing it or you're watching it or you've
4974240	4976240	bought it or you're, it's being shown somewhere and you're watching it in a
4976240	4978240	community of people, that's okay.
4978240	4979240	So, okay.
4979240	4980240	That exists on the outside of it.
4980240	4984240	If you look at it and do an inventory of what's going on, it's horrifying.
4984240	4988240	And it's just stuff that contributes often to, well, what's horrifying.
4988240	4992240	I just want, I want to get more specific, like, like you're very, you're, you
4992240	4997240	like, like, like, like, can we just like trade, like, like things that are like,
4997240	5001240	you know what, this is part of the problem, not part of the solution.
5001240	5006240	This is, uh, ridiculous, but not actually causing any part of the problem.
5006240	5010240	And then is there something that's like actively maybe making the world a
5010240	5014240	better place while still being porn, which, which would be a new category of
5014240	5016240	porn in any respect.
5016240	5020240	I mean, everything is like, first of all, inherently misogynist.
5020240	5021240	Yeah.
5021240	5028240	I just don't think that to isolate it as, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Disneyland Paris
5028240	5033240	where this kind of stuff happens where things are a little bit cracked, but, uh,
5033240	5035240	lovely things happen, you know?
5035240	5036240	Right.
5036240	5038240	Wait, no, I think you might have misunderstood me.
5039240	5043240	I'm saying like in a world where you can, where Donald Trump is like pulling
5043240	5047240	fucking charts that are about this, like, there's a difference between genuine
5047240	5053240	racism and then this just dumb, like 90 IQ playfulness of like, if you're like,
5053240	5057240	like we keep thinking that like, like, first of all, like ignorance does lead
5057240	5063240	to hatred because if you're ignorant, you can be like revved up by people who are
5063240	5065240	willing to take advantage of you.
5065240	5070240	The people who aren't actively invested in your hatred are for instance,
5070240	5077240	pornography is they're invested in your animalistic, like release and your
5077240	5080240	indulgence of like crazy taboo fantasies.
5080240	5086240	So I think it's very notable psychologically that in politics you will
5086240	5093240	hear more genuinely, problematically racist things put forward in ways that
5093240	5097240	actually last and lead to policies and things like that.
5097240	5102240	What if you, if you, if you were to go into the porn world where supposedly
5102240	5105240	everyone's a fucking idiot and they're, therefore they should be the most
5105240	5109240	racist people in the world, but no, because they're not incentivized by hatred.
5109240	5112240	They're, they may be totally inappropriate.
5112240	5116240	They're not the most stylistically like savvy people in the world.
5116240	5119240	So you have just people going like, Hey, click here.
5119240	5122240	If you want to watch a white woman take two giant big black cocks,
5122240	5125240	because you know how black those fucking big cocks are.
5125240	5133240	Like it's not like, it's, it's, it's, if you're, if you're, if you're like,
5133240	5136240	all of those, all of these, I mean, the only difference between like that
5136240	5139240	example and the other example is that those guys at the end of their, their
5139240	5144240	end game is policy, public policy legislation.
5144240	5149240	And poor people aren't really, their, their end game isn't that.
5149240	5151240	I don't know what they're doing either.
5151240	5154240	I'm fucking locked into you all of these words, but there are all of these
5154240	5158240	and your big black mind, take it down.
5158240	5166240	It's fucking stretching my little white racist hole out.
5166240	5170240	You'd be shocked what you're capable of.
5170240	5174240	There are, but these are all sort of microcosms and each one of those has
5174240	5178240	at its core a resonator and that resonator hits all of these points.
5178240	5181240	So all the things you're saying that the politicians are doing that Trump is
5181240	5185240	doing also exist and are in play in the world of porn.
5185240	5191240	So yes, some of these things and their abstracted way, draw people who are
5191240	5196240	going to see this and somehow their world is going to open a little bit or whatever.
5196240	5202240	But again, within that whole idea that of ignorance, there's, there is selected,
5202240	5205240	there's this ignorance where somebody is ignorant and they are not in control.
5205240	5207240	The fact that they don't know anything, they don't know it.
5207240	5208240	So that's that.
5208240	5215240	Then there's this sort of selected ignorance where people choose to stay ignorant
5215240	5220240	because they know that outside of that fence, more information comes that may
5220240	5224240	change the way they are or that shakes them from their sort of their pedestal.
5224240	5226240	And a lot of what you see in porn is that.
5226240	5231240	It's just fence building to keep people in a world that allows them to do whatever.
5231240	5236240	And you know, it's a zero sum game in the sense that if that person never ventures
5236240	5241240	out of their house, then we don't know what ill will they're harboring.
5241240	5245240	But some of those people in some factor in a one to 10 sample, some of those
5245240	5247240	three people do enter out.
5247240	5252240	And in that sample, there are some people who do things that are not great.
5252240	5254240	And of that, some of those things become public.
5254240	5258240	And then we on the outside look at those people and go, well, how do we get to this?
5258240	5259240	How do we come to this place?
5259240	5261240	How did this person get here?
5261240	5265240	So I think that all of it's in play in all of these, even in music, it's the same stuff.
5265240	5269240	And we can have the same kinds of debates about people using the n-word and rap
5269240	5271240	and people who, you know, with that.
5271240	5275240	You know, all manners of entertainment, we have always used that to express like
5275240	5279240	from the time when it was like, okay, Rob, don't you fucking move.
5279240	5280240	Oh, he's putting his phone away.
5280240	5281240	Okay.
5281240	5285240	I thought he was leaving again.
5285240	5287240	Put my phone away.
5287240	5289240	Well, because entertainment is visceral.
5289240	5296240	And it's like, yeah, if you take racism into the world of media, you're probably
5296240	5299240	not going to get disabused of it within media.
5299240	5301240	That's what we tend to do wrong.
5301240	5306240	And then we applaud things that we go like, you know what, this is so good, it might
5306240	5309240	like a Norman Lear sitcom or something like that.
5309240	5313240	You go like, this is so good that you could come into it racist and leave possibly
5313240	5318240	somehow having been tricked into your mind opening a little bit.
5318240	5325240	I'm not, when we're holding the yardstick of whether or not it's doing good or bad
5325240	5331240	or that it's like, I think we were probably on the same page and looking at like, the
5331240	5337240	thing that I'm saying is sort of remarkable is just that it's like, okay, so compare
5337240	5338240	it to religion.
5338240	5342240	Like, why would there be more racism, more prevalent in religion?
5342240	5347240	And I know what you're talking about is what do you, like, okay, racism is the fences
5347240	5348240	that you're talking about.
5348240	5351240	So any place where you're conscious of race, then you're not helping, right?
5351240	5352240	That's racism.
5352240	5353240	That's sexism.
5353240	5360240	That's bias of learned, like chosen bias, I would say, selective bias, people who are
5360240	5361240	knowingly.
5361240	5367240	So like, in all porn, you're always watching a woman get, like, fucked by a guy, not in
5367240	5368240	all porn.
5368240	5371240	That was a sometimes a scooby doo.
5371240	5380240	I'm saying, like, for women, women have been dealing with this forever, like, pornography
5380240	5390240	tends to involve, you don't, you, it's a difficult highway cone set to navigate taking your feminism
5390240	5391240	into pornography.
5391240	5395240	There's a lot of dumb people making a lot of stuff and etc.
5396240	5403240	That's the outer edges of how you define it and the people who have a sense of pushing
5403240	5408240	borders of sexuality and how it's accepted are the ones who are trying to, who have always
5408240	5413240	tried to sort of make it a thing so that you leave it as a choice for the other person
5413240	5415240	to decide what it is they want to be comfortable with.
5415240	5420240	But you also try to take things that people are uncomfortable with and make them understand
5420240	5422240	that there are other sensibilities out there.
5422240	5426240	But it gets, like all things, it gets corrupted and it gets changed by the money makers.
5426240	5429240	You look at the things that are, for example, I don't know if this will make any sense,
5429240	5437240	but there was a time when Walmart or a chain of some sort selected to remove any Rush album
5437240	5443240	with the Starman symbol on it because he was nude and that was perceived to be sexual
5443240	5448240	and trying to force Polygram or Mercury to take that symbol off of the Rush album covers.
5448240	5450240	Are you sure it wasn't because Rush sucks?
5450240	5452240	All right, let's not get distracted.
5456240	5458240	All right, well, let me, I think...
5458240	5460240	After the show, Demarche.
5460240	5461240	We're after the show.
5461240	5462240	I'm already there.
5462240	5465240	Every time we have a conversation of heavy gravity, I perceive myself as just dragging
5465240	5468240	you back into a pettiness.
5468240	5474240	But I thought of another, just another example, which is that, okay, on Twitter, we have an
5474240	5479240	African-American president who I noted at one point, like he can't tweet.
5479240	5481240	His team can't tweet.
5481240	5483240	Healthcare is good.
5483240	5484240	Going good.
5484240	5486240	Gotta keep that Guantanamo going.
5486240	5487240	Everybody, I'm the president.
5487240	5488240	He makes a tweet.
5488240	5493240	If you look through the replies invariably, at least one use of the n-word.
5493240	5496240	And FLOTUS's Twitter is worse.
5496240	5500240	Well, let me just finish my little thing.
5500240	5508240	So, isn't it a little crazy that if you go to Pornhub Premium, now available for gift
5508240	5511240	prices...
5511240	5512240	But for how long?
5512240	5516240	And they do have, like porn sites have comment sections, and they have titles, and they have
5516240	5519240	editors, and they have directors, and they have writers, and they have actors.
5519240	5523240	You don't, I don't, that seething hatred...
5523240	5528240	Maybe it's because, like, if you're going, if you're looking at porn, you're usually
5528240	5531240	doing it by yourself in the privacy of your own home, and there's no agenda to it.
5531240	5535240	Well, maybe it's because you're looking at porn, you already feel like you're doing
5535240	5541240	something wrong, therefore you're actually in an honest zone, so you've actually
5541240	5546240	compartmentalized yourself, and it's like the ambition to be a good person may be,
5546240	5552240	like, hugely responsible, like, for so many things that we do wrong to each other.
5552240	5556240	I also think with a president's society, a lot of that stuff, you leave up, because
5557240	5560240	you want the world to see, sort of, what is out there, you don't want to pretend.
5560240	5564240	Mr. Demarj, I don't, I don't follow her, but you're saying that, that, that FLOTUS,
5564240	5566240	that she...
5566240	5569240	Well, but that's not, but I mean, it's not just her, because, I mean...
5569240	5571240	Rose and Barr...
5571240	5573240	I think we're straight for the point, though.
5573240	5576240	I don't think porn sites cull their comment sections for racism.
5576240	5580240	I'm just saying, I hadn't thought about the fact that, that, that, you know,
5580240	5583240	Mrs. Obama is getting nailed every time she opens her mouth on Twitter, of course.
5583240	5587240	About, about anything, and some of it's, and not, and much of it isn't racist,
5587240	5589240	it's just weird sexist stuff, or...
5589240	5591240	Oh, it's terrible, awful.
5591240	5592240	It was possible to exist.
5592240	5593240	But you leave it up.
5593240	5599240	I mean, you look at, like, so, okay, the, when Obama was first elected president,
5599240	5606240	there's a song called, I forget what it's called, it's a country song by...
5606240	5608240	Shoot, I'm taking a tenth of you guys in.
5608240	5609240	Hank Williams Jr.?
5609240	5610240	No, sir.
5610240	5611240	It's a good guess.
5611240	5613240	I think it's called The Monkey President or something like that.
5613240	5614240	Whoa!
5614240	5615240	Whoa!
5615240	5616240	Here's the trick.
5616240	5617240	Hear me out.
5617240	5618240	Hear me out.
5618240	5619240	Let him finish.
5619240	5621240	It's a legit country song.
5621240	5623240	It is, it's not Roy Acuff.
5623240	5625240	It's somebody like, and I'm not, I don't want to attach any names to this,
5625240	5626240	but it's somebody...
5626240	5627240	It's like Toby Keith.
5627240	5628240	Is it Toby Keith?
5628240	5629240	No, no, no.
5629240	5631240	Your, your way, it's, it's, this is, this is old school.
5631240	5633240	This is in the, the highwayman era.
5633240	5637240	And, but when you look at the song, and people were great, people were just throwing
5637240	5640240	a song out there, posting it everywhere, et cetera, et cetera, and people were appalled
5640240	5641240	about this day and time.
5641240	5642240	People would write a song like this, et cetera.
5642240	5648240	The song is from 1975 or 1906, it turns out, and it was written about Jimmy Carter.
5648240	5651240	But you have people who are so anxious to do something, and they go,
5651240	5653240	remember that song from a long time ago?
5653240	5657240	And then they pull it out, digitize it, send it out, and just start this chain that goes
5657240	5658240	on, because that's what's out there.
5658240	5659240	They love it.
5659240	5662240	You know, you go into that wormhole and you see it, and there was a time on MySpace
5662240	5667240	where I stumbled onto a clan site, like a guy's page.
5667240	5668240	He just was in the clan.
5668240	5669240	That was it.
5669240	5673240	The graphic design, when I went through his friends, it occurred to me
5673240	5679240	suddenly that the clan had their own sort of sub, people who were just their friends
5679240	5684240	who market their graphic design skills out to them, and they are clan-specific.
5684240	5689240	Just glittering stars and horses with hoods, just gifts, whatever.
5689240	5693240	Just riding around the back of your biode, riding in the background.
5693240	5696240	I mean, this stuff exists out there.
5696240	5697240	And what do you do?
5697240	5698240	You don't wipe it away.
5698240	5701240	One of the benefits of the world that we live in now is that we do see all this
5701240	5704240	so that it's not just whispered about, and it's not just shadows sort of drifting
5704240	5705240	around the corners.
5705240	5707240	Do you feel that's a good thing?
5707240	5708240	I mean...
5708240	5711240	I mean, it's a thing, and there's enough stuff going...
5711240	5712240	It could be seen.
5712240	5713240	It could be seen.
5713240	5715240	Yeah, and I think that there's enough stuff going on in the world right now that we don't
5715240	5716240	have time to be...
5716240	5717240	Sorry.
5717240	5721240	The Rule 34 thing, do you think that there's any porn where it's guys dressed up
5721240	5724240	as KKKs, fucking Scooby Doos?
5724240	5726240	Well, I was going to say...
5726240	5728240	If not, if not now, there will be tomorrow.
5728240	5730240	There is not a dearth of KKK...
5730240	5732240	I've stumbled onto KKK sites.
5732240	5734240	I've stumbled onto cartoons of like...
5734240	5735240	Stumble.
5735240	5736240	Like terrible...
5739240	5740240	Fair enough.
5741240	5742240	Fair enough.
5747240	5749240	Might as well stay here.
5751240	5754240	And I do, because I'm like, holy fuck.
5755240	5762240	And I don't stumble into what I would call racist porn.
5762240	5766240	I stumble into what I would call constantly a...
5766240	5769240	I guess what maybe you and I would agree is like a...
5771240	5772240	What do you call it?
5772240	5775240	A perpetuation of fences in porn.
5775240	5777240	I mean, like the idea...
5777240	5778240	The opening doors...
5778240	5783240	If you want to know that black guys have huge dicks and all this stuff,
5784240	5785240	you're not going to be...
5785240	5788240	There's not a lot of activity going on in porn that's supposed to...
5788240	5790240	That's designed to like blow...
5790240	5792240	Like sophisticated you.
5792240	5797240	But what you don't see is like videos where it's like...
5797240	5803240	Where people are being dehumanized actively in the narrative.
5803240	5804240	Except the women.
5804240	5805240	I'm sorry, what?
5805240	5811240	I don't see like white guys saying to black guys in porn
5812240	5817240	like, hey, you're not a human being so you should fuck this person.
5817240	5819240	I don't see like racist shit.
5819240	5827240	I see consciousness of race and horrible affirmation of like off the top stereotypes
5827240	5829240	because they're not bright people.
5829240	5831240	I got to get porn at a premium then.
5831240	5832240	What are you watching?
5832240	5838240	Can you at least just say, just tell me a piece of porn that you watched that was like...
5838240	5839240	I don't even...
5839240	5840240	I just know like, okay, let's say...
5840240	5841240	Or you're like, this is fucked up.
5841240	5843240	I'm walking away from this fucking...
5843240	5844240	Like, this is...
5844240	5845240	I'm...
5845240	5846240	No, I don't...
5846240	5847240	I think it's...
5847240	5852240	The big thing is generally like the abuse of the women and it's like...
5852240	5854240	Jeff, please put a sock in it.
5854240	5856240	I asked him a question.
5856240	5858240	I was saying, I don't think...
5858240	5862240	What you're saying is like, if you want to go into a site and watch little...
5862240	5865240	I think if you look hard enough, you'll find it.
5865240	5867240	Did you look hard enough?
5867240	5868240	No.
5868240	5869240	Okay.
5869240	5870240	It just showed up.
5870240	5871240	All right.
5871240	5872240	I mean, I'm...
5872240	5873240	That's what I'm saying.
5873240	5874240	What did you say?
5874240	5875240	It just showed up.
5875240	5876240	What did you see that just showed up?
5876240	5877240	Everything you just described.
5877240	5878240	What...
5878240	5880240	Words, weird, shaming.
5880240	5881240	Yeah.
5881240	5883240	You actually saw like...
5883240	5884240	So like actual...
5884240	5885240	Yeah, man.
5885240	5889240	Like status, like where they're low status, like where the black protagonist is low status.
5889240	5890240	It's...
5890240	5891240	Yes.
5891240	5892240	Absolutely.
5892240	5893240	I mean, it's right there.
5893240	5894240	It's there.
5894240	5895240	It's even there.
5895240	5900040	If you're looking at something else and it's linked to porn related stuff, it's in the
5900040	5906000	advertising on the side, because that world is full of people who just...
5906000	5909040	In that zone, it's catch as catch can.
5909040	5911680	If you don't want to see it, you're not going to hit click and go through that door.
5911680	5914480	If you want to see it, you'll go through the door, whatever your intentions are, if you're
5914480	5918760	curious and you just want to do field recordings in your mind of what's out there, you'll go
5918760	5919760	through there.
5919760	5921920	If that's what you need, then you'll go through there.
5921920	5922920	Whatever that stuff is.
5923840	5929720	Probably a majority of it is, it's an extension of the misogyny, because it's the gang bang,
5929720	5933680	kind of like, oh, this woman...
5933680	5941200	It's like, oh, no, the black guys are going to come in and they're being characterized
5941200	5943160	as a force of nature rather than...
5943160	5945920	I feel like there's a lot of stuff.
5945920	5948960	It's in a normal world, let's say you work in human resources and there's four or five
5948960	5952160	people in the cubicle section with you.
5952920	5957560	You hate Frank and you have some problems with Laurie and this, that, and the other.
5957560	5961960	But right now, we are living in a world where you're constantly reminded that those things
5961960	5964200	are misguided, malintended.
5964200	5967040	You really can't do that in the real world.
5967040	5974200	It wasn't too long ago that you could print out a list of the 10 most sexist jokes you
5974200	5978360	could think of, 10 most racist things you could think of and pass it around and the
5978360	5979760	people that were with you would do it.
5979760	5980760	You can't do that shit anymore.
5980760	5981760	You can't do that shit.
5981760	5984960	You've got to go dark web about it and then if you get found out, you're fired and you
5984960	5985960	can't.
5985960	5987480	But you can, and every once in a while you see this happens.
5987480	5988480	Now you can't.
5988480	5991960	Those people are constantly reminded that they've got to either adjust, open up their
5991960	5996320	world and figure out a way to be, or they've got to calcify themselves and harden, ossify
5996320	5998360	and tighten up.
5998360	6004560	What they're banking on often in these sites, I think, is that you've got to go somewhere.
6004560	6006480	You've got to put yourself someplace.
6006480	6009600	They're saying, here's a room and here's a jar, squeeze in, whatever.
6009600	6013120	So that was a very compelling argument that I finally registered in my head.
6013120	6015560	Yeah, I do think that that's what it is.
6015560	6020200	You're saying that's enabling, like, I think what I heard you just say is that there's
6020200	6026240	actually hope for the future in terms of that, like, that as progress happens, there's restraint
6026240	6031240	happening and actually these crevices that you can go down and explore deep darkness,
6031240	6037480	that those are actually just enabling something that maybe we should cut off.
6037520	6041840	I do wonder if the market model hasn't changed to that now, where it's just sort of these
6041840	6044880	things that you, trust me, it's the holidays.
6044880	6047640	Many of you are going to go home and you're going to have people sitting at the table
6047640	6051240	who are going to say something and the whole table's going to stop and look and they're
6051240	6052240	like, what?
6052240	6054760	Y'all didn't care about that three years ago.
6054760	6060680	But those people, imagine being that person and every single day, television, elsewhere,
6060680	6065800	everything, commercials, are reminding you that where you thought you had planted yourself
6065800	6068280	in life is where you're going to stay.
6068280	6071360	And not only are you behind the curve, but you're behind for a long time.
6071360	6074360	It just didn't get loud enough until now for you to see it.
6074360	6079400	So the amount of catch-up work you're going to have to do is, that mountain is steep and
6079400	6083580	you've either got to run hard and run fast and run long or run slowly and probably not
6083580	6090040	live to see your sort of comeuppance, but it can be an exhausting proposition.
6090040	6091040	So what do you do?
6091040	6096040	Day to day to day and under the weight of that thing.
6096040	6103480	And I mean, if you read like Rick Bass or these authors, the modern American authors
6103480	6109520	right now who are writing, who have replaced the mailers and the updates and the carvers,
6109520	6112080	these are the pressures that they're writing about right now.
6112080	6117000	The protagonists, the carver protagonists, back then, often what they were dealing with
6117000	6122620	was marriage and relationships and modern relationships and the things that we've been
6122620	6126840	taught and how those things don't necessarily apply because the world around us is changing.
6126840	6133040	And so how do suburban dreams continue to exist?
6133040	6135760	How do we keep that framework up when everything around us is changing?
6135760	6137360	So, you know, that kind of stuff.
6137360	6142840	What's changing now I think is affecting people individually who come from that world because
6142840	6148680	they now have to get out of that neighborhood and they have to deal with a whole other set
6148680	6155520	of principles and that tension in those people, that coiled tension.
6155520	6158400	If you offer a release to somebody and say nobody can see it because it's happening in
6158400	6163000	a world that is a gridless basically.
6163000	6166300	You think that's, you're saying that's like, that's like the ring of power.
6166300	6169240	That's like giving a piece of heroin.
6169240	6172760	That's a, you know, you're saying, I think there's a lot of that.
6172760	6177320	That sort of Pavlovian incentive stuff, incentivized stuff going on in people who are, and, and
6177320	6182000	I'm having a totally different experience that is absolutely, probably equally valid.
6182000	6188280	I would even probably go so far as a self loathing person to say your, your point of
6188280	6194360	view is way more valid, but I'm like, I, I'm having the exact opposite experience right
6194360	6201420	now because I just got divorced, which means that I lived in a world like, like for years
6201420	6208060	where everything was about the obligations that I had to everybody around me.
6208060	6212300	And of course, middle aged men, they get divorced and then they, characteristically, they, they
6212300	6215820	get the tattoo and the Tesla and they start, they start saying inappropriate things to
6215820	6220700	their younger coworkers and they, they just turn into like douchey cavemen.
6220700	6224820	And I think, I think, I think part of that is that they, it's like this pendulum that
6224820	6228180	swings back and forth between reality and fantasy.
6228180	6235020	And I think, I think that in a world where like we all have like USB slots in our foreheads
6235020	6238580	at this point, like I think, I think one of our biggest issues that we're, that we're
6238580	6242620	contending with that we, we haven't actually labeled is that is the division between fantasy
6242620	6248820	and reality because we are such a successful empire.
6248820	6252580	And we've, one of the things that we've, we've successfully done so much as created like
6252580	6256740	these dreams that we dream together that we, and we don't even really, all we do is go
6256740	6260500	to work and pull levers and then it's like, we watch six hours of TV a day.
6260500	6265180	So it's like, like, we don't actually, it's like actually a big deal if someone on TV
6265180	6271100	like, like makes us think a certain thing or represents a certain demographic as a thing.
6271100	6275700	It's like, we look at that as the same as a Senator voting wrong and we get very upset.
6275700	6280180	And I think one of the, I think one of the big crucial issues is we have so little respect
6280180	6285100	for ourselves that we can't actively go, here's reality.
6285100	6289520	And here's actually like, here's my biochemistry.
6289520	6294740	Here's like my fucked upness, which is, you know, this sewer where I like watch dinosaurs
6294740	6297340	chase motorcycles, but we won't do it.
6297340	6300140	Cause then the guy in the motorcycle goes, by the way, I'm running for president next
6300140	6301140	week.
6301140	6302140	And we're like, Oh really?
6302140	6303140	Yeah, that makes sense.
6303140	6304140	Of course you would.
6304140	6306020	You, you outran a dinosaur.
6307020	6311420	And if the dinosaur says like, you should, you should buy Panasonic, but Panasonic turns
6311420	6312420	out to make landmines.
6312420	6314660	We're like, oh, I'm going to boycott your company.
6314660	6316100	Like we have no division.
6316100	6321620	Like we, we, because we sit around and just watch where we've, we were the third act of
6321620	6322620	Wally.
6322620	6325300	Like we just sit and watch shit.
6325300	6332020	Like that shit actually, ironically is toxically infected with reality.
6333020	6339740	Cause right now what I'm experiencing is a douchey middle-aged divorcee is like indulgence
6339740	6341180	in fantasy.
6341180	6345660	And it's making me a happier person in my day to day life because I'm actually actively
6345660	6350660	able to like, I go, uh, and I come and then I go time to go to work.
6350660	6351660	That was dark.
6351660	6361780	Um, and then I'm like, I'm like, something, something, I feel like you don't feel like
6361940	6368220	something got now in my mind, what my view is something got released and what your, your
6368220	6372500	view is, which is equally valid, as I said, if not more, is that maybe something got along
6372500	6374820	the way, depending on what you're indulging.
6374820	6376420	Maybe there's seeds getting planted.
6376420	6378900	No, there's nothing being affirmed or perpetuated.
6378900	6380620	I just think that people are, are different.
6380620	6384220	I think that on the other end of that, the moneymaker end of it, the reason somebody,
6384220	6385220	I mean, you have no idea.
6385220	6386220	The guy's programming.
6386220	6387220	That's these sites.
6387220	6391660	My people programming these sites might be the most liberal, most understanding people
6391660	6395860	in the world, but from a moneymaking end of it, they understand that.
6395860	6398980	You know, that's, that's, that's the goose.
6398980	6400300	So that's the golden goose.
6400300	6405340	And so they're just going to keep, you know, they just keep finding ways to, to, to, to
6405340	6406900	maximize that potential.
6406900	6411540	And you can see what you were talking about, uh, in the way, in these, this, this run of
6411540	6417540	GOP debates and the first one up to the last one, um, this past week, there's no reason
6417540	6421780	any of these debates said anything that anybody needs to think anything about.
6421780	6426260	There's no reason any of these polls say anything that anybody really needs to think anything
6426260	6427500	about.
6427500	6431620	What's going to happen is in January, we're going to wipe all that, anybody who knows
6431620	6435740	anything is going to wipe any, all that shit out, uh, Iowa's going to happen.
6435740	6438640	I believe New Hampshire still is going to happen next.
6438640	6441180	And so, and that's, and that's a caucus, I think.
6441180	6445700	And so what's going to happen is that whole paradigm is going to fall away.
6446020	6449380	And if you ask the question, well, why the hell do we spend so much time on it?
6449660	6454140	Well, there are so many cottage industries that are connected to the idea of broadcasting
6454140	6460620	that, making graphics for it, making that sort of Mad Max, very road, uh, uh, flaming
6460620	6462060	guitar theme music for it.
6462060	6465100	God, it scares the shit out of us and all that other stuff.
6465140	6468700	I don't know that Ted Cruz, Cruz guys, he's got the goods.
6470700	6473940	But wait, when they start, when they, like in January, when we start having our first
6473940	6475700	debates, that's when it actually really counts.
6475700	6477260	That's what I like here when it matters.
6477500	6480340	And from that point on, you can calibrate and that past, that's the way it's been.
6480580	6484180	But it's interesting how many more debates there are in the lead up to this, given this
6484180	6488500	particular situation and to watch this happen and watch how many people are talking
6488500	6492660	about it, how many headlines are posted about it, how many are in gigantic bold, like
6492660	6496620	just as if this is the Lindbergh baby resolution.
6496620	6497940	And it's, none of this shit is real.
6497940	6500860	And it's just, well, you've given us the perfect segue into our regular segment.
6500860	6503460	Rob Shrobs, Politics Corner.
6517460	6521100	Yeah, yeah, sorry, I dug my hand in there, but you know what I hate?
6522860	6523940	What do you hate, Rob?
6524180	6534060	Christmas Greed, this game, you ever go to like a family thing or like a work thing?
6534060	6536100	It's called like the White Elephant game.
6536100	6536500	Oh, right.
6536500	6537700	Yeah, we all do that.
6538300	6539860	That's a stupid game.
6540860	6541780	Stupid.
6542300	6543700	Everybody's like, I don't know.
6543700	6545820	Oh, God, I don't like it.
6546660	6548900	That was Rob Shrobs, Politics Corner.
6553940	6559380	Rob, that was a good one, too.
6559380	6563820	I got to say, I didn't think you could top your last Politics Corner.
6563820	6566900	That one, it was trenchant, it was biting, it was incisive.
6566900	6571620	How do you feel about Ted Cruz's shenanigans?
6571620	6572620	The skateboard guy?
6572620	6573620	Yeah.
6581620	6582620	I don't know anything.
6582980	6588100	I don't know, if Ted Cruz was standing in front of me, I wouldn't know.
6588100	6590020	I've never seen the man.
6590020	6592980	I don't know what he looks like, I don't know if it's a guy, I don't know.
6592980	6594540	Who is admission impossible five?
6595340	6596340	Wasn't?
6596340	6597340	God damn it.
6597340	6598340	Oh, shit, sorry.
6598340	6600740	Just, it's for the seat, it's not.
6602260	6603260	Oh, no.
6607260	6608740	I've disgraced the seat.
6609740	6613740	All right, how do we wrap up a show with no Spencer?
6613740	6622740	I'll just yell, Cloth Hanger, and I'll play this.
6623740	6626740	Yeah, come on.
6626740	6629740	Do you want to, are we doing a show next Sunday, or do we have a show?
6629740	6630740	Are we going to be a gun?
6630740	6634740	No, no, no, no show next, next week, wait.
6634740	6637740	Yes, you'll be in New York, I'll be in New York.
6637740	6639740	I'll be in New York next week, so there's no show, but also...
6639740	6640740	What are you doing in New York?
6640740	6644740	January 3rd, there was going to be a show, it's my birthday.
6644740	6645740	That's your birthday.
6645740	6647740	And I'll still be in New York, so...
6647740	6648740	Have fun.
6648740	6649740	Yeah, sorry.
6649740	6651740	So, this is our last show of 2015.
6651740	6655740	Oh, we should do one of our end of the year recaps.
6660740	6663740	Rob, you want to take us through the year in Harmon Town?
6663740	6665740	What do you think?
6665740	6667740	What's different from where we started?
6667740	6670740	I don't know, I wasn't here at the beginning of the year.
6670740	6672740	Well, just make it up.
6672740	6673740	Make it up?
6673740	6674740	Demorra, what do you think?
6674740	6676740	I guess we're done with me.
6676740	6682740	Has Harmon Town grown in any way, or changed, or have we devolved, devolved?
6682740	6684740	Yes.
6688740	6691740	Cloth Hanger!
6696740	6698740	This thing's trying to leave everybody for coming up, Fred.
6698740	6700740	Trying to leave it?
6700740	6704740	Go check out his band, Super Beat.
6704740	6705740	Where?
6705740	6706740	Bar Mila?
6706740	6707740	Cafe Mila?
6707740	6708740	What the hell is it called?
6708740	6709740	I don't know.
6709740	6710740	Yes, I'm like that.
6710740	6714740	Also, the music I'm playing right now is our good friend Derek Carter, who gave us his song,
6714740	6717740	and he's fantastic, so check him out online.
6717740	6718740	Rob Schrod!
6718740	6719740	Demorra Brown!
6719740	6721740	I'm Jeff Harris!
6722740	6727740	It's Exact McKeever, Chris Boroff, Dustin Marshall, everybody here at Meltdown Comics.
6727740	6731740	Your mayor, of course, Mr. Dan Harmon, everybody.
6734740	6738740	I want to give a shout out for William Matsuka.
6738740	6739740	Matsuta.
6739740	6746740	Spend the rest of the year noticing that pornography is ironically less racist than politics and religion.
6746740	6748740	That's all I ask.
6749740	6752740	Rest in peace, William Matsuka.
6752740	6755740	Try fast, take chances, everybody. We love you.
6756740	6758740	Did you get any of that?
6758740	6761740	It's a good show!
