0	20160	Hello, one and all, welcome to Nerd and Mel Theater at Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California.
20160	22160	Harman Town is now in session.
22160	34160	Won't you please join me in welcoming to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
34160	41160	Thank you.
41160	47160	Oh, so much to do because we took a week off last week and thank you all for coming.
47160	51160	I know you had so many comic books to go through because you were all at Comic Con.
51160	56160	That's why we all go there now for the comic books, right?
56160	62160	It's not Sundance or anything. It's a comic book convention.
62160	70160	I mean, we could talk about Comic Con, we could talk about my upper endoscopy,
70160	79160	which I survived and had a Buddhistic existential experience during, because I got it rough.
79160	84160	Boy, what a surgical procedure I went through.
84160	92160	But we could talk about all that, but the truth is it's 8-10 and our first guest has to attend bar downtown at 8-30.
92160	95160	He's going to leave.
95160	103160	I want you to welcome one of our wonderful feral audio podcast brothers, a pioneer of the podcasting medium, in fact.
103160	107160	I think he was doing it before everyone had a podcast.
107160	110160	Jeff, you're a Studs Terkel fan, aren't you?
110160	113160	Totally.
113160	115160	I really thought you would be.
115160	117160	I know very little about Studs.
117160	120160	I'm a fan of his name more than anything.
120160	129160	Well, this guy in some respects is kind of the anti-Dan Harmon, because he has very meaningful conversations in good interviews with very interesting people.
129160	136160	And all I do is do bad interviews with people from feral audio. Please welcome Matt Dwyer.
141160	146160	If you want to drink, I can have someone make you one.
147160	151160	I don't want to work yet, so if somebody else could bartend for me right now.
151160	154160	Your podcast is called Conversations with Matt Dwyer.
154160	156160	Yeah, very narcissistic of me.
156160	160160	I'm proud to be a label mate of yours, because I listened to a little bit of it today.
160160	167160	You're one of those guys that I wish, I guess I wish I was like, but I know I never could be.
167160	170160	I don't even want to be like me.
171160	173160	You're a listener and not a talker.
173160	182160	I mean, you're somebody that actually is, as our friend, Sikh Donnelly, who came out here, who's an aneurysm survivor, therefore a shamanic representative.
182160	188160	I said, what do we have to do, those of us in the land of certainty?
188160	190160	And he said, give more than you take.
190160	196160	And I think, guys, you give a little more than you take, because you book really provocative guests and have really interesting conversations.
196160	200160	And all I do is stand up here and go, I had an endoscopy.
200160	206160	Yeah, well, when I started the show, I was hoping I would be really funny while talking to interesting people.
206160	213160	But when you're talking to like a Black Panther or Wayne Kramer talking about his prison stint, it's really hard to make jokes.
213160	219160	But you don't have to, because that Black Panther dude, for instance, I was riveted.
219160	227160	I'm trying to write the first episode of Community right now, but I got you cranked up like I'm Terry Gross doing my research.
227160	230160	I didn't want to embarrass myself. You're an adult coming in.
230160	234160	I didn't want to be like, so what's your podcast about? I wanted to know.
234160	236160	So, Dan, what is his podcast about?
236160	239160	It's about this Black Panther guy.
239160	243160	362 episodes with one Black Panther guy.
243160	248160	We go each crime to each food, because they did a lot of soup kitchen stuff.
248160	251160	We talk about each soup extensively.
251160	253160	What was that guy's name? Pat O'Neill?
253160	254160	Pete O'Neill.
254160	257160	Pete O'Neill. A little less Irish than Wayne.
257160	262160	Really weird, though. He does have a brogue. Black Panther from Kansas City with a brogue.
262160	267160	Why? Why can't we get over this class system that's oppressed and African-American?
267160	270160	We've got to fight the power to be...
270160	273160	Power to the people, motherfuckers.
273160	277160	Someone's trying to take me, horseshoe-shaped civil rights.
277160	281160	Very funny. Three white guys doing this.
281160	286160	But one thing that he said, he said something so...
286160	289160	Well, I don't know if it was profound or if it was just sort of like narcissistic.
289160	293160	I'm like, that's what I'm always saying, and a Black Panther's saying it.
293160	297160	Because he said...
297160	299160	By the way, just a quick backstory.
299160	303160	This guy was kind of basically trumped up charges sometime in the 60s and has been in Tanzania ever since.
303160	307160	Yeah, but before he became a Black Panther, he was like a street hood.
307160	311160	He was a pimp, I believe, which he doesn't even like to talk about.
311160	313160	And then the Black Panthers changed his life.
313160	321160	His charges were trumped up, but he does admit that he did smuggle some guns in his time.
321160	323160	So he had done some pretty crazy things.
323160	327160	And he talks about how the Black Panthers...
327160	331160	The thing that he said that really perked my ears up was when he was talking about how
331160	335160	the first thing they tried to do to neutralize the Black Panthers propaganda-wise
335160	337160	was to call them a racist organization.
337160	343160	And he said, racist organization, all we were preaching from the beginning was about class systems.
343160	345160	And I was like, yes, this is exactly what I'm talking about.
345160	347160	Race is an artificial construct.
347160	351160	I'm always saying, you don't have to read a fucking book to figure this out.
351160	352160	You do not have to...
352160	355160	And it's great if smart people do smart work to try to figure this out,
355160	357160	but it's right under everyone's nose.
357160	360160	Children don't understand what race is.
360160	361160	You get taught this stuff.
361160	363160	This is about poor people and rich people.
363160	365160	And he was saying, of course, as a Black organization,
365160	368160	your primary thrust is going to be on what the Black community can do.
368160	374160	As you would expect poor white people to have a primary thrust, maybe on what poor white people can do.
374160	376160	I'm putting words in his mouth at this point.
376160	379160	And then he said, we should all eat more bacon?
379160	381160	No.
381160	383160	Now I'm just trying to get back on Atkins.
383160	385160	Black Panthers said it.
385160	387160	But it's always about class.
387160	388160	It's always been about class.
389160	393160	And it was so interesting that he could have the calm state of mind,
393160	397160	having been basically exiled to Tanzania, where he's running an orphanage,
397160	402160	that he was so cool and objective about the global state of affairs.
402160	403160	Yeah.
403160	406160	But we've talked besides the podcast, too.
406160	407160	And he said it took him a long time to get there,
407160	414160	because I guess there was times in Tanzania where he'd chased some dudes down the street with a knife and stuff.
414160	417160	He used to be a little temperamental, but now he's like 77.
418160	420160	He's getting a little tuckered out.
420160	423160	But he's still like this big, strong motherfucker.
423160	425160	You wouldn't want to screw with him even at 77.
425160	426160	He's a badass.
426160	430160	You also, on that list of your legitimate interviewings,
430160	433160	before we get to the thing that I think I really want to plug because it drops,
433160	434160	I think Monday.
434160	436160	Are we dropping it Monday?
436160	437160	Can you give it?
437160	438160	Oh, yeah.
438160	441160	But that Monsanto guy, that was another big one.
441160	443160	One of Monsanto fans here tonight?
444160	448160	I didn't know if that was going to be somebody booing Monsanto or a pro.
448160	451160	No, they love, they love, they love bio-engineered fruit.
451160	452160	This is Los Angeles.
452160	455160	Nothing grows here unless it's part giraffe.
457160	459160	It's more comic book sounding to have bio-engineered fruit.
459160	460160	Yeah, these guys are nerds.
460160	461160	They love sci-fi.
461160	464160	Of course they want their oranges to glow in the dark.
465160	469160	But you had this guy, he wasn't specifically a Monsanto employee.
470160	475160	He worked for the main research company that worked for Monsanto,
475160	479160	and he couldn't, it sounds kind of bullshitty when you're like,
479160	482160	he couldn't say his name because it sounds like you're just being weird.
482160	484160	But he couldn't because they'd come after him,
484160	486160	and if you've ever seen any documentaries,
486160	488160	Monsanto likes to fuck people in the ass.
488160	491160	And he couldn't, you know, they would,
491160	494160	he would get sued to high fucking heaven.
494160	497160	But the greatest thing about that interview is there's a really poignant moment
497160	499160	that he and I were having, and he couldn't see this,
499160	502160	but behind him, his dog was taking a shit, and it was a,
502160	504160	and it was like one of this,
504160	507160	and the dog was just chasing its own stringy shit behind him.
509160	511160	And I was like, why don't I videotape this show?
512160	514160	Why don't you blow the whistle on that?
515160	518160	Talk about an ancient orange and glow in the dark pineapple.
520160	524160	What do you do when you, like, were you invested at all in the,
524160	528160	in that topic, that area of politics before you found out
528160	531160	you were going to get to sit down with a Monsanto whistleblower?
533160	537160	I mean, I'm pretty fucking way to the left.
537160	540160	Like, I might make Chomsky look conservative.
541160	544160	But, yeah, I'm always interested in political things.
544160	547160	I mean, when I started doing the show, I was hoping to just talk to anybody
547160	550160	because I feel like most people have interesting stories,
550160	553160	but then I'm a weirdo, so I started going after, like,
554160	556160	you know, Black Panthers and political radicals.
556160	557160	But how do you go after them?
558160	561160	Well, the Black Panthers explained how you go after them in the 60s.
563160	565160	It's amazing who you can find on Facebook.
569160	572160	I found Pete on Facebook, and, yeah, I just,
572160	575160	and then you start, once you start talking to a bunch of weirdos,
575160	578160	these weirdos go, hey, I got some more weirdos you can talk to.
579160	582160	And a guy I've interviewed twice, Shane Bugbee and I,
582160	585160	grew up together, and Shane, in high school, was like,
585160	588160	publishing G.G. Allen, John Wayne Gacy.
588160	592160	It was like, fresh out of high school, he was Gacy's art dealer.
594160	598160	Like, an art dealer, like, a guy who dealt art to John Wayne Gacy,
598160	599160	that he'd bring by.
599160	602160	By the way, nobody booed. Monsanto got a boo.
603160	606160	What has Monsanto done for any birthday party?
613160	617160	But Shane has worked with, did someone say Joe Rogan's joke?
618160	620160	Or is that some weird mental projection?
621160	624160	I thought I heard the words, Joe Rogan's joke?
624160	626160	Jim Gavigan's joke, asshole.
627160	629160	I'm not a stand-up.
629160	633160	I'm sorry if my John Wayne Gacy joke was on someone else's set list.
633160	635160	Anyways, please continue.
635160	638160	Oh, just, Shane is, and you should listen to his episodes,
638160	641160	and Google Shane Bugbee, because he's a guy who's done
641160	645160	incredibly crazy things, and like, G.G. Allen,
645160	648160	he stole Ed Gein's Tombstone and toured it around the country.
648160	652160	And then he started his own soda pop company.
652160	655160	He's just some guy who does weird things like that.
655160	658160	But he's hooked me up with a lot of these people,
658160	660160	like Paul Krasner, he hooked me up with Paul Krasner,
660160	662160	if you don't know who Paul Krasner is.
662160	664160	Oh, Paul Krasner.
666160	668160	Paul Krasner created The Realist, which was like this
668160	672160	really heavy-duty satirical magazine in the 60s.
672160	674160	And the greatest thing about Paul Krasner is
674160	676160	he tripped on acid with Groucho Marx.
677160	679160	And he tells the story on my show.
679160	682160	So he really saw time fly like an arrow and fruit fly like a banana.
684160	686160	That actually happened.
687160	690160	And Shane's the one who hooked me up with Lucy and Greaves.
690160	691160	Greaves, Greaves.
691160	692160	Lucy and Greaves.
692160	694160	That's the next thing to talk to you about.
694160	698160	Okay, so you can take over any time you want.
698160	700160	I just want to see if I can get this right.
700160	702160	So, which borough, is that the name of this?
702160	704160	The Westboro Baptist Baptist Church.
704160	706160	Those are the God hates fags people.
706160	708160	God hates fags.
708160	710160	Joe Rogan's joke.
710160	712160	Westboro Baptist.
712160	715160	These are more easily known as the God hates fags people.
715160	717160	They hold a sign that says God hates fags
717160	719160	anywhere where they think anyone will be watching.
719160	721160	Like, for instance, as they threatened,
721160	724160	they were going to do it at the funeral
724160	727160	for the Boston Marathon victims.
729160	732160	They implied, I guess, it was implied that they were going to,
732160	734160	yep, we're going to do it there, too.
734160	736160	We do it everywhere where the heat is.
736160	738160	Because when a message is that important,
738160	743160	you've got to get your billboard up at the corner of Fountain and Wilshire.
746160	749160	So, the head of their church, Phelps...
749160	750160	Fred Phelps?
750160	751160	Fred Phelps.
751160	752160	He has a dead...
752160	753160	Brother?
753160	755160	I think it was his mother.
755160	759160	So, this organization called the Temple, the Satanic Temple.
759160	760160	Yeah.
760160	765160	They did what they called a pink mass on the grave of his grandmother.
765160	768160	Turning her gay in the afterlife.
770160	773160	They did a Satanic gay ritual.
773160	777160	So, Fred Phelps' mom is getting hit with a strap-on as we speak.
779160	780160	It really blows the mind.
780160	781160	I went down a rabbit hole today.
781160	784160	I was like, okay, who are these Satanist guys?
784160	786160	I mean, I went to their site and I...
786160	789160	I mean, their name is the setup and the punchline is the fact
789160	792160	that they're good people.
792160	794160	I mean, as far as their tenets go.
794160	795160	I went down there.
795160	798160	They have nine tenets on their front page of their site.
799160	803160	You follow your compassion, be good to other humans.
803160	805160	Never push your beliefs on anyone else.
805160	807160	Let people do whatever they want.
807160	808160	Always keep an open mind.
808160	812160	Nothing to do with Satan or eating a chicken heart or anything.
812160	813160	Yeah, they don't do any...
813160	815160	That's the weird misconception.
815160	818160	We talk about the misconceptions of Satanism
818160	821160	and we also talk about how this pink mass,
821160	826160	which the media treated as something that's been going on for hundreds of years.
826160	830160	Sorry, I should be clear because I'm a bad interviewer.
830160	835160	This drops on Monday on your podcast, Conversations with Matt Dwyer.
835160	838160	You got to have a conversation with Lucian Greaves,
838160	840160	the head of the Satanic Temple.
840160	843160	And I really rarely get to brag about anything in my life,
843160	848160	but he turned down a bunch of people, including Maren, to do my show.
851160	853160	Take that, Mark Maren, and all your money.
854160	856160	Take that, Mark Maren.
856160	858160	Can you book us on your show?
861160	863160	And there is going to be, because there is something,
863160	865160	and I wish I could say what it is, but I can't,
865160	870160	there's going to be a big twist in this whole Lucian Greaves thing,
870160	873160	which Shane Bubby, who I talked about, is going to bust on...
873160	875160	bust?
875160	878160	Is going to break in Vice magazine,
878160	881160	and then I'm going to do a follow-up interview with Lucian as well.
881160	885160	Wow, it's like NBC's Star Cross Thursdays, back in the old days.
885160	888160	Matt Damon is going to be in the Central Perk,
888160	891160	but then also Daphne is going to be on MASH.
891160	893160	I don't know.
893160	895160	I haven't watched TV in a long time.
895160	898160	It's good that new media is getting there, too.
898160	900160	But how did that interview go?
900160	901160	What's he like?
901160	902160	What's this spell like?
902160	905160	He's like the nicest guy in the world, and he's super smart.
905160	907160	It's not surprising.
907160	908160	This seems like a pretty...
908160	913160	On its face, it seems like a very juvenile fuck you thing to do,
913160	915160	to do anything on someone's grave.
915160	918160	But then you peel back the layers, and you peel back the layers,
918160	920160	and you're going like...
920160	925160	I actually cut and pasted a comment from an argument about it on Facebook
925160	930160	that I thought justified the existence of comment sections,
930160	932160	because it's like...
932160	935160	Somebody said about this, because he did this pink mask
935160	940160	on the grave of a dead woman, making this guy's loved one gay in the afterlife.
940160	943160	But these are the people who...
943160	947160	I mean, their whole belief system is about freedom of religion.
947160	951160	Not to put too fine a point on it,
951160	954160	they hide behind the concept of freedom of religion
954160	956160	in order to do something that is not really religious,
956160	959160	and is certainly unconstitutional,
959160	961160	which is to imply that other people don't have the freedom
961160	963160	to do whatever the fuck they want.
963160	966160	And so this is sort of like turnabout is fair play,
966160	968160	and it's kind of funny,
968160	971160	having two chicks make out on this lady's grave.
971160	977160	And I'll say, I like to go where the sense of humor seems to be.
977160	980160	But somebody said, in a comment section,
980160	983160	of course, someone said, two wrongs don't make a right.
983160	987160	Okay, that's the response to what he did.
987160	991160	And then this fella, Corey Hammond, I'll name him, I don't care.
992160	997160	He said, and overused cliche statements don't make you intelligent.
997160	1001160	The Westboro Baptist Church has always been lawful.
1001160	1003160	Half of his kids are First Amendment lawyers
1003160	1006160	and goes to court daily to fight their actions,
1006160	1008160	and they always win.
1008160	1010160	The best way to beat them is at their own game,
1010160	1011160	and this is it.
1011160	1013160	If you aren't explicit enough to do it,
1013160	1016160	the WBC is, so be explicit enough.
1016160	1019160	In other words, I don't know, then you go,
1019160	1022160	okay, so we're just getting in a knife fight with people who love knives,
1022160	1024160	and where's that going to go?
1024160	1029160	But it certainly, you know, it makes you go like,
1029160	1031160	yeah, these guys are calling themselves Satanists
1031160	1033160	and making themselves heroes,
1033160	1035160	and it's kind of a wonderful, ticklish thing.
1035160	1038160	And he's got prosecutors coming after him,
1038160	1041160	and there was a great quote at the end of an article about him recently
1041160	1044160	where he said, if I go to prison, I'm going to use my powers of Satan
1044160	1047160	to turn it into one big gay orgy.
1048160	1050160	Talk about light work.
1050160	1053160	That is not a tough road to hoe.
1053160	1056160	You're halfway home already.
1056160	1062160	So, I don't know, how does a guy like me be a guy like you?
1062160	1065160	Do you read more than me?
1065160	1069160	Are you just more interested in other people than yourself?
1069160	1071160	Do you drink more, drink less?
1071160	1074160	Oh, no, I drink often during my interviews.
1074160	1076160	Maybe that's not the key.
1077160	1079160	I just realized early on,
1079160	1081160	because probably in some of my first interviews,
1081160	1084160	I'm trying to be like Johnny Glibb, like, wack-a-woo,
1084160	1088160	and then I was just like, this isn't about you.
1088160	1092160	Like, I just quickly realized, it's like, these people are,
1092160	1095160	I'm talking to people who are far more intelligent than I'll ever be,
1095160	1097160	and far more fucking interesting,
1097160	1099160	so shut the fuck up and learn something.
1099160	1101160	I can't break that barrier. How do you get there?
1101160	1104160	Well, you're smarter than me, so maybe that's different.
1105160	1108160	But it's like, I interviewed this guy, Dan Kowalik,
1108160	1110160	who sued Coca-Cola for paramilitary-
1110160	1111160	My name's Dan!
1116160	1118160	That's all I thought when you said that.
1118160	1119160	No, that's right.
1119160	1120160	Please continue.
1120160	1125160	Oh, no, he's a lawyer who sued Coca-Cola for death squads in-
1127160	1128160	Jug-stan, hope-joke.
1129160	1132160	Coca-Cola was killing union organizers in Colombia,
1132160	1136160	and he found a loophole in our government, or our laws, to sue Coke,
1136160	1138160	and it's like, there's a documentary about it, actually,
1138160	1140160	and we don't talk about it much, but like, I'm like,
1140160	1143160	what am I gonna fucking joke around or I'll talk this guy about?
1143160	1144160	Right.
1144160	1145160	He's like, this guy's a super-
1145160	1146160	But how do you ask, what do you ask?
1146160	1148160	I mean, how do you, you have to engage them
1148160	1150160	and get them to the places where you want them to say stuff,
1150160	1152160	but so you have to know all kinds of stuff,
1152160	1155160	and then, I'm such a bad interviewer.
1155160	1157160	It's the running joke on this.
1157160	1161160	Yeah, I mean, I guess maybe part of it is I came from an improv background,
1161160	1163160	because I don't, like, have a lot of notes.
1163160	1166160	I have, like, maybe five things written down,
1166160	1169160	and I'll just, if something, usually somebody will say something
1169160	1171160	that piques my interest and I'll wait for them to finish,
1171160	1175160	and hopefully I can just, like, be like, how about that?
1175160	1177160	Do you take notes while they're talking?
1177160	1178160	Mental notes.
1178160	1179160	Mental notes.
1179160	1183160	I interviewed this guy just a couple days ago who's an amazing artist,
1183160	1186160	Rod Luft, or Rodrigo Luft, but look up his word.
1186160	1188160	But he said something about how sometimes he'll create something
1188160	1190160	and he'll find it embarrassing and then he'll talk for a bit,
1190160	1193160	and then I was like, all right, why would somebody be embarrassed
1193160	1197160	about, like, this brilliant artist who's actually here, by the way?
1197160	1204160	Why would this guy who's incredibly brilliant be embarrassed
1204160	1206160	by something he creates, and so I wanted to,
1206160	1209160	and it comes down to we're all just fucking insecure and weird.
1209160	1212160	Yeah, we're all ashamed of ourselves deep down,
1212160	1216160	and I'm sorry, I've been through several PR experiences lately
1216160	1219160	where I've suddenly realized, okay, we're all ashamed of ourselves
1219160	1224160	and from now on, instead of trying to get everyone to like me
1224160	1228160	because I'm ashamed of myself, I'm only going to care about the people
1228160	1231160	who don't make their shame other people's problems.
1231160	1235160	Like, I think that I'm just going to bother to say
1235160	1237160	that there's shitty people in the world.
1237160	1239160	I'm not going to keep preaching this thing where I'm like,
1239160	1240160	I love everybody.
1240160	1242160	Fuck half of the people.
1242160	1246160	Specifically the half of the people that make their very human shame
1246160	1247160	someone else's problem.
1247160	1250160	Someone that says like, I'm ashamed of myself, so shut up over there,
1250160	1252160	stop talking, don't say that.
1252160	1256160	Everybody be quiet, everybody be careful, because I have to be,
1256160	1258160	because I have some weird fucking thing about me,
1258160	1260160	or I don't know how to talk.
1260160	1261160	Like, fuck those people.
1261160	1265160	I'm sure they're not evil, but you've got to have an enemy, I guess,
1265160	1267160	according to them.
1267160	1273160	I mean, it's interesting because I can safely say I've spoken with
1274160	1277160	some people who are legitimately creative geniuses
1277160	1278160	and they all have...
1278160	1281160	Thank you.
1281160	1284160	I was just about comma Dan Harmon.
1284160	1286160	But yeah, and it's all like every...
1286160	1290160	None of them really fully go, yeah, I got this.
1290160	1292160	Yeah, I mean, well, yeah, you can.
1292160	1293160	You can.
1293160	1294160	Not unhelp people.
1294160	1296160	Not be effective at all.
1296160	1297160	Yeah.
1297160	1301160	Like, you have to be fucking terrified
1301160	1304160	in order to be somewhat effective, I would think.
1304160	1305160	Otherwise, what do you...
1305160	1307160	Yeah, you'd be some weirdo.
1307160	1308160	You have to have a little...
1308160	1311160	I don't know if this is the Irish working class bullshit in me,
1311160	1313160	but like, I think you can't really be good at anything
1313160	1316160	unless you kind of hate yourself just a little.
1316160	1317160	Yeah.
1317160	1321160	I mean, that's what I love about myself, is how much I hate myself.
1321160	1324160	I hate how much I love you.
1324160	1326160	All right, you're a better interviewer than me.
1326160	1328160	Ask me something provocative and...
1328160	1330160	See what Dan did just there?
1331160	1338160	He created a construct where he would have someone ask things about him.
1338160	1339160	I'm looking for a closer.
1339160	1341160	I'm not gonna generate it, because I'm not him.
1341160	1343160	Yeah, but you could have had him interview somebody in the audience.
1343160	1345160	Oh, okay, good idea, Jeff.
1345160	1346160	Very smart.
1346160	1348160	Jeff Sober tonight, he's on a cleanse.
1351160	1352160	Talk to...
1353160	1355160	I've been sober for like the last 10 shows.
1355160	1357160	I ate four steaks today.
1361160	1364160	Hey, N.T., will you have a conversation with Matt Dwyer?
1365160	1366160	This is N.T.
1371160	1373160	Oh, shitballs.
1373160	1376160	I only had a little bit of vodka and I'm falling off the goddamn chair.
1376160	1380160	N.T.'s irregular here, but okay, just dive in.
1382160	1385160	Without knowing anything about what you do, what do you do?
1387160	1389160	Right fucking getting deep.
1390160	1392160	I mean, are you a creative sort?
1392160	1394160	Well, yeah, I want to do writing and stuff.
1394160	1399160	But I recently was let go of a job that I had.
1399160	1401160	What was the job?
1401160	1402160	Black Panther.
1402160	1403160	I mean, was it...
1404160	1406160	He was an Irish Black Panther.
1407160	1408160	Trumped up charges.
1409160	1414160	I worked in social media and I did movie marketing stuff.
1415160	1417160	That's just called tweeting that you liked Iron Man 3.
1418160	1420160	That never paid anything.
1421160	1425160	So are you taking that as like, all right, I could fuck this.
1425160	1427160	I'm just going to dedicate my life to writing.
1427160	1430160	Oh, well, no, I wanted to do writing before that.
1430160	1431160	No, I know.
1431160	1434160	But taking the job is like losing your job is maybe like a sign of...
1434160	1440160	Yeah, like maybe it was time that it needed to happen because I kind of wasn't happy there.
1440160	1443160	So I was like, okay, I can see Dan.
1443160	1445160	See, Dan, you guys, I'm going to pause this interview.
1445160	1448160	You're not watching because you're making yourself another cocktail over there.
1448160	1453160	But I've just noticed a little trick that you can employ where you have to be like,
1453160	1455160	he's looking right at him.
1455160	1458160	It's very uncomfortable for people with my condition.
1460160	1462160	Okay, sorry, play.
1464160	1466160	What kind of writing are you going to do?
1466160	1468160	Screenwriting.
1468160	1470160	You should have said sitcom writing.
1471160	1473160	Well, I actually...
1473160	1475160	He's doing the long con.
1476160	1478160	It's going to take a couple of years.
1478160	1482160	And he's better than Anatoly, who came up a couple of weeks ago and was like,
1482160	1484160	hire me as a director, I'm from Russia.
1484160	1486160	Oh, okay, Anatoly's here.
1488160	1490160	Hello, Anatoly, good to see you.
1490160	1492160	Anatoly was at Comic Con.
1492160	1495160	Anyways, sorry, derailed your interview.
1495160	1497160	Oh, I thought you just said thank you, it was nice seeing you.
1497160	1499160	I thought you ended it.
1499160	1500160	Oh, because you have to go?
1500160	1502160	No, because it was a big laugh.
1502160	1504160	I know, I know.
1504160	1506160	All right, Matt Dwyer, yay!
1507160	1509160	He's got to go to work.
1509160	1510160	Let him go to work.
1510160	1511160	Thank you, sir.
1511160	1513160	Matt Dwyer, good to see you, Matt.
1513160	1514160	Hello.
1515160	1517160	Thank you, NT, thank you, NT.
1518160	1521160	So that episode that we were talking about, he interviews,
1521160	1524160	he sits down with Lucien Graves, the head of the satanic temple,
1524160	1528160	I'm probably butchering this, about this pink mask thing that took place on this grave.
1528160	1531160	It's bound to be a pretty interesting interview.
1531160	1533160	But I've not listened to his podcast.
1533160	1535160	I've known Matt for a few years, not very well,
1535160	1540160	but doing acid with Groucho and gay post-mortem grannies.
1540160	1542160	This is good stuff.
1542160	1543160	Yeah.
1543160	1544160	I like it.
1544160	1545160	Yeah, he's a better person than me.
1545160	1546160	Why don't you marry him?
1546160	1547160	All right.
1548160	1550160	So we should...
1550160	1554160	Well, Feral Audio, Jeff, you know that Matt Dwyer is part of the Feral Audio network.
1554160	1555160	I say, what?
1555160	1556160	Yeah.
1557160	1560160	Did you know that there's a lot of interesting content on the Feral Audio network?
1560160	1562160	Well, I had no idea.
1562160	1565160	Did you know, for instance, that Erin McGathey's This Feels Terrible
1565160	1569160	has three live episodes available on the new Feral Audio store?
1569160	1570160	Shut your mouth.
1573160	1577160	And if there was an edit point where we were going to play 30 seconds of one of those...
1577160	1580160	It would go a little something like this.
1580160	1582160	Let's bring out our guest.
1582160	1585160	You know her from NBC's Community and a million other things
1585160	1588160	so cool and smart and adorable, Gillian Jacobs.
1589160	1591160	Just write your notes again.
1591160	1592160	Stop looking at them.
1592160	1594160	It says Gillian.
1594160	1595160	Stop it.
1595160	1599160	And then it says, you know her as Britta from NBC's Community.
1599160	1602160	And then it says dot, dot, dot, Gillian Jacobs exclamation point.
1602160	1604160	Like, who are you talking to?
1606160	1608160	Do you think you might not be able to make the show?
1608160	1609160	And some of...
1611160	1613160	Adam, go out and just be me.
1614160	1617160	And make sure, I better excellently, just give it a flourish.
1617160	1619160	And we're back.
1621160	1622160	All right.
1622160	1624160	So moving on, let's see.
1624160	1625160	What have we got to talk about?
1625160	1627160	Let's talk about people shoving tubes down you
1627160	1630160	and you dressing up like a little lady in a movement.
1630160	1633160	Yeah, if you follow me on Instagram, you saw that I was wearing a little gown.
1633160	1635160	I went and got an upper endoscopy.
1635160	1636160	I'm 40 years old.
1636160	1638160	I've had heartburn for about three years.
1638160	1642160	Once I started taking Prilosec every day, everything's fine.
1642160	1648160	But then I was watching a commercial for Prilosec with Larry the Cable Guy,
1648160	1653160	and I didn't know where to put my eyes, so they went to the bottom of the screen
1653160	1655160	where I saw the warnings at the bottom.
1655160	1659160	And it said, like, if you're taking this for more than, I don't know, six weeks
1659160	1660160	or something like that...
1660160	1662160	You might be a redneck.
1665160	1667160	That's Fox Road, yeah, I'm sorry.
1668160	1671160	I see a doctor, so I did.
1671160	1673160	And the doctor did what a good doctor does.
1673160	1677160	He sent me to a friend of his from medical school and charged me a referral fee.
1677160	1681160	And I went to that guy, and he did what a good referral doctor does,
1681160	1685160	which is go down a clipboard of, you know,
1685160	1690160	questions that lead to him recommending a procedure that he makes money off of.
1690160	1694160	And I signed off on it, and I went to this little clinic, and they...
1695160	1697160	This is my first medical procedure ever.
1697160	1700160	Unless you count, like, stitches for my brother beating my ass and stuff.
1700160	1702160	You were under general anesthesia, were you not?
1702160	1704160	Yeah, like, they put an IV in me.
1704160	1706160	This was my first IV.
1706160	1708160	I feel like I can still feel a little whole.
1708160	1710160	It's very traumatic.
1710160	1713160	I don't think I've ever met anyone that went through what I've been through.
1716160	1719160	But I was, like, laying there in the bed, and then, yeah,
1719160	1723160	and then they just, like, they put some extra stuff in your IV,
1723160	1725160	and they go, like, okay, you're gonna get a little sleepy.
1725160	1726160	And it's like...
1726160	1727160	And then it's four days later.
1727160	1729160	And it's incredible.
1729160	1731160	I had my... I mean, just to interject for a second,
1731160	1733160	the only time I've ever gone under was for my wisdom teeth.
1733160	1736160	Like, a year or two ago, I had all four taken out.
1736160	1738160	And apparently, there was a struggle.
1738160	1741160	Because when I woke up, the office was empty.
1742160	1744160	The doctor was gone.
1744160	1746160	The nurse was there, and she looked fatigued.
1746160	1748160	And I'm not joking, my belt was undone,
1748160	1751160	and I had defense wounds on my arm.
1751160	1753160	I had scratches on my forearms,
1753160	1756160	consistent with fending off a knife fight.
1756160	1759160	Can't you even be unconscious, normal?
1759160	1760160	Can't you?
1760160	1761160	Can't you...
1761160	1764160	Do you have to be special when you're knocked out, too?
1764160	1766160	I think I got raped.
1766160	1767160	That's special.
1767160	1769160	Me, me, me.
1769160	1771160	At least he took pictures of my balls.
1771160	1772160	Something happened.
1772160	1773160	Maybe x-rayed them.
1773160	1774160	Yeah.
1774160	1775160	See if there's a...
1775160	1776160	I don't know, man.
1776160	1778160	But, yeah, but I woke up, and I said, go,
1778160	1779160	you're gonna get a little sleepy,
1779160	1780160	and then I didn't even hear the pee.
1780160	1783160	Then I woke up, and there was a crime had been committed.
1783160	1785160	Yeah, I honestly don't...
1785160	1787160	No offense to dentists.
1787160	1789160	If you're a dentist, and you work hard,
1789160	1791160	and you care about people, and you're wonderful,
1791160	1794160	I'm not saying a statement about dentists,
1794160	1798160	but I am saying that being a dentist,
1798160	1801160	I don't think, is enough of a qualification
1801160	1804160	to have that much power over another human being.
1804160	1806160	By default.
1806160	1808160	I don't think it's...
1808160	1810160	That's not cool.
1810160	1812160	He was an oral surgeon, you know.
1812160	1813160	When they do that...
1813160	1815160	Well, aren't we all?
1816160	1818160	Touche.
1820160	1822160	I think it's pronounced tushy.
1822160	1824160	See, I knew you weren't a surgeon.
1824160	1826160	Serious over-bitch up!
1829160	1831160	I'm just saying, they put me under.
1831160	1832160	They said, you're gonna start to feel drowsy.
1832160	1833160	I laid on my side, and they're like,
1833160	1834160	you're gonna start feeling drowsy.
1834160	1835160	And then I just like...
1835160	1837160	It's just like when you fall asleep.
1837160	1839160	You can't ever remember the moment you fell asleep.
1839160	1840160	You remember being sleepy.
1840160	1841160	You remember waking up.
1841160	1843160	But I mean, so much more profound,
1843160	1846160	because while I was sleeping,
1846160	1851160	they did ridiculous things to my body.
1851160	1854160	I mean, most notably shoving a camera down my esophagus
1854160	1856160	for 25 minutes.
1856160	1858160	And I have no recollection of it.
1858160	1859160	They could have done butt stuff.
1859160	1861160	They could have done anything.
1861160	1863160	And I just woke up.
1863160	1864160	I came to...
1864160	1866160	You can see it on my Twitter feed.
1866160	1868160	I wasn't doing anything good.
1868160	1871160	The lady who was putting me under...
1871160	1874160	I think a friend of hers wrote on season four
1874160	1875160	of Community or something.
1875160	1880160	So we were having a conversation about it
1880160	1882160	before she was putting me under.
1882160	1884160	She's like, oh, my friend wrote on that show.
1884160	1885160	So and so.
1885160	1887160	And I said, who?
1887160	1889160	And she's like, so and so.
1889160	1890160	You're a writer in Community.
1890160	1893160	And I was like, season four, perhaps?
1893160	1894160	And she's like, yeah.
1894160	1898160	And I'm like, yeah, I didn't work on that season.
1898160	1900160	She said, oh, you're not working on the show anymore?
1900160	1902160	I said, I worked on seasons one through three.
1902160	1903160	Now I'm coming back for season five.
1903160	1909160	And an anesthesiologist went, that's weird.
1909160	1913160	A woman who...
1913160	1916160	That's how weird it is.
1916160	1920160	A lady with no horse in that race is like, that's weird.
1920160	1922160	I'm like, yeah, no shit.
1923160	1924160	I'm going to give you drugs.
1924160	1926160	And we're going to shove a hose down your mouth.
1926160	1927160	But I will say this.
1927160	1931160	From what I know about television, that's very odd.
1931160	1934160	That situation that you're in.
1934160	1938160	So I woke up on a gurney and it was moving.
1938160	1940160	And there were these ladies looking down at me
1940160	1942160	like I was a baby in a crib.
1942160	1945160	It must be adorable for them when people wake up.
1945160	1947160	And they're smiling at me.
1947160	1953160	And I went like, give me my phone.
1953160	1956160	I'm a writer.
1956160	1958160	And the anesthesiologist went, give him his phone.
1958160	1961160	He's a writer.
1961160	1963160	And they gave me my phone.
1963160	1966160	And I tried as hard as I could to tweet while I was coming to.
1966160	1968160	And you could see the tweets.
1968160	1971160	They're absolutely Cyrillic.
1971160	1973160	It's not your best work.
1974160	1976160	Only Anatoly would be able to read them.
1979160	1981160	Yeah, it was not my finest work.
1981160	1983160	And it wasn't like I was trying to say something profound.
1983160	1985160	All I was trying to do was go, I'm trying to tweet.
1985160	1987160	So it wasn't really worth it.
1987160	1988160	Why did you include I'm a writer?
1988160	1991160	How did you think that would expedite you getting me?
1991160	1993160	This goes above all of our heads.
1993160	1996160	My conscious mind is not accountable to the things
1996160	1999160	my unconscious mind says as soon as I come out of unconsciousness.
1999160	2002160	Apparently, I define myself by what I do
2002160	2004160	and felt like it entitled me to a phone.
2004160	2007160	I had a friend, because you have to get driven home from the hospital
2007160	2008160	when you go under.
2008160	2011160	So my friend drove me home from getting my teeth pulled.
2011160	2014160	And I was still on the medication they had.
2014160	2016160	But they said, in a couple hours, it'll wear off.
2016160	2017160	Go to your pharmacist.
2017160	2019160	And here's the prescription for the stuff.
2019160	2021160	So I said, oh, that was really stoned.
2021160	2023160	And I said, we have to go to my place,
2023160	2026160	because my insurance pharmacy cards are upstairs.
2026160	2028160	So I went and got all my insurance cards upstairs.
2028160	2030160	And I go, oh, I should take this trash out, too.
2031160	2033160	So I took the trash out.
2033160	2034160	And we get to the pharmacist.
2034160	2035160	There's people waiting.
2035160	2037160	And I'm like, oh, man, it's starting to wear off.
2037160	2039160	It really hurts.
2039160	2040160	It really hurts.
2040160	2042160	And I finally get up to the front.
2042160	2043160	And I don't have my cards with me.
2043160	2045160	And we had to go back and look for the cards.
2045160	2046160	I had thrown them out.
2046160	2048160	I put them in the trash.
2048160	2051160	I was like, I shouldn't have been allowed that much responsibility.
2051160	2054160	I shouldn't have been allowed to be in a car.
2054160	2056160	Even though you need a ride, it should
2056160	2059160	be illegal to get a ride home with your girlfriend after that.
2059160	2061160	I was a prick to Erin.
2061160	2064160	But it was all dressed up like I was
2064160	2067160	the protagonist of the Dead Zone or something.
2067160	2070160	I was just being mean to her, because I
2070160	2073160	had been to unconsciousness and back.
2073160	2075160	I was like, Erin, I don't know.
2075160	2077160	I wanted to go get a drink.
2077160	2084160	And Erin, the villain in this story,
2084160	2088160	had overheard the professional doctors tell me not to drink,
2088160	2094160	because I had anesthetic-ishness in my bloodstream.
2094160	2097160	And so Erin, the villain in this story,
2097160	2101160	said, no, I'm not going to take you to the drawing room.
2101160	2107160	And I was like, Erin, I have been to oblivion and back.
2107160	2115160	All I know is for 25 minutes of today, I did not exist.
2115160	2117160	And I came back into existence.
2118160	2121160	And I shouldn't be regretting it.
2121160	2125160	I love my return to consciousness so much,
2125160	2127160	I want to go straight to a bar.
2127160	2130160	I really was on this trip where I was like, man,
2130160	2132160	I touched nothingness.
2132160	2135160	And I preferred it.
2135160	2138160	Oh, so you were willfully trying to go get back in there.
2138160	2139160	Kind of.
2139160	2142160	I just wanted to be somewhere dark and cold and have an Amstel.
2142160	2145160	I really wanted to just be alone more than anything,
2145160	2149160	because I really felt like I had never made it to 40
2149160	2153160	without ever being knocked out voluntarily,
2153160	2156160	or by another's hand, I should say.
2156160	2160160	And I was like, wow, I was gone for 20 minutes.
2160160	2163160	And then I was back.
2163160	2167160	And it was great to be back, but it wasn't bad to be gone, either.
2167160	2169160	It wasn't that big a deal.
2169160	2172160	Yeah, man, I'm right with you, man.
2172160	2174160	I'm on the same wavelength, bro.
2174160	2177160	And I kind of felt like that was an important, healthy exercise.
2177160	2179160	Maybe at 16-year-old's birthdays,
2179160	2183160	they should just have a guy knock you out,
2183160	2186160	just so you can be dead for a second.
2186160	2195160	Well, that's an unfortunate linkage to the John Wayne Gacy thing from earlier.
2195160	2198160	Your reactions are weird, and you're weird people.
2198160	2200160	It doesn't matter.
2200160	2203160	Their reaction was they were waiting for what the next statement was going to be.
2203160	2205160	I was saying, it should be a rite of passage,
2205160	2211160	but 40 years old is too late to learn that it's OK to not exist.
2211160	2214160	People knock themselves out all kinds of ways.
2214160	2215160	They choke each other?
2215160	2219160	Yeah, but if I drank a fifth of bourbon and passed out
2219160	2221160	and you shoved a camera down my gut,
2221160	2224160	I'd wake up and go, stop!
2224160	2229160	Stop it, brah!
2229160	2233160	This is knocked out out.
2233160	2237160	And I think the reality of that is a little bit important.
2237160	2240160	It's not as profound as taking ayahuasca or anything.
2240160	2243160	But 40 is too late to learn that.
2243160	2245160	I'm looking out for 20 minutes.
2245160	2248160	Do you recall any visions?
2248160	2250160	No, that's the point.
2250160	2253160	That's our biggest fear with death,
2253160	2256160	unless you really think that...
2256160	2260160	I mean, my biggest fear with death is that your last thought will play out.
2260160	2262160	You'll be like, oh shit, did I leave the iron on?
2262160	2268160	And then for perceived infinity, because your brain is also in charge of how you perceive time,
2268160	2272160	you'll forever be wondering about your iron.
2272160	2274160	But that might be also, was I a dick to my friends?
2274160	2276160	Or I owe Toby 50 bucks?
2276160	2280160	They're just like, forever.
2280160	2285160	But I think, by and large, our biggest fear is nothingness, oblivion.
2285160	2289160	My biggest fear was, why was my belt off when I came to?
2289160	2291160	All right.
2291160	2294160	I mean, I have no point. I'm just saying.
2294160	2297160	I'm just saying, as special as I was before this experience, Jeff,
2297160	2302160	I am now like, Galvatron to my former Megatron.
2302160	2306160	I have bathed in a lava of thank you, thank you guys in the back.
2306160	2309160	Are you okay? Did you get a clean bill of health here?
2309160	2310160	What's going on with you?
2310160	2313160	Well, he didn't. I mean, he said he found a polyp.
2313160	2317160	He made it sound like a thing that you find in a seashell on a beach.
2317160	2320160	He was just like, I just grabbed it.
2320160	2323160	You have a coral reef growing inside.
2323160	2325160	Everybody has a polyp here and there.
2325160	2329160	He was like, I found a polyp like he found a penny.
2329160	2333160	But he said, you know, there's inflammation, you're 40, you got heartburn.
2333160	2337160	I didn't see anything weird.
2337160	2339160	I didn't see Godzilla down there.
2339160	2344160	I didn't see anything. But they'll give a full report to my doctor.
2344160	2346160	And you said you're going to stop drinking tomorrow.
2346160	2348160	You're going on a little juice cleanse.
2348160	2351160	Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm not.
2351160	2354160	Don't applaud stopping drinking.
2354160	2358160	I'm going on a cleanse because I've gone way off my diet.
2358160	2362160	And I think the best way to get back on that diet is to thank you, sir.
2362160	2365160	We've got to stop going to them for anything.
2366160	2370160	All right.
2370160	2373160	Our next guest is Anatoly. Get up here, Anatoly.
2373160	2376160	Let's get that guy back up here.
2381160	2383160	I didn't know that I was a guest.
2383160	2389160	So I want to get my 10 bucks for this ticket back.
2389160	2393160	He wants us 10 bucks back because he's a guest.
2393160	2395160	Now I'm a guest at the show.
2395160	2396160	Wow.
2396160	2398160	That's a dangerous precedent to set, man.
2398160	2402160	No, no. If you come up on the show, you can have 10 dollars.
2402160	2404160	Perry, you know what?
2404160	2407160	Keep the change. Perry's strike up, baby.
2407160	2410160	20 dollars. A 20 dollar bill.
2410160	2411160	How many rubles is that?
2411160	2413160	Well, because he was a guest last time, too.
2413160	2414160	It's like 600.
2414160	2415160	600 rubles?
2415160	2416160	Damn.
2416160	2417160	Yes.
2417160	2421160	So, Anatoly, I got some follow-up questions having listened to the podcast that you were on.
2422160	2425160	You came up, you said you came to UCLA to be a director.
2425160	2426160	Yep.
2426160	2429160	We said, do you have any favorite directors? No.
2429160	2431160	You did fantastic.
2431160	2432160	I had favorite directors.
2432160	2433160	I had favorite directors.
2433160	2434160	All right. Who's your favorite director?
2434160	2435160	Wes Anderson.
2435160	2436160	Oh, Wes Anderson? Okay, great.
2436160	2437160	That's a good guy.
2437160	2439160	And no one clapping.
2439160	2441160	Wes Anderson.
2441160	2443160	Wes Anderson, guys.
2443160	2446160	Dan just shut them off. Dan just told them to stop.
2446160	2449160	Yeah, I mean, we're not on good terms, me and the audience.
2450160	2452160	I think they should just follow their hearts.
2452160	2454160	You guys clap or boo whenever you feel like it.
2456160	2457160	Fuck you!
2458160	2459160	Show's over.
2466160	2470160	So then we did a scene from Mad Men and you directed us.
2470160	2472160	Which I thought was pretty good.
2472160	2473160	Our scene work?
2473160	2475160	I thought our scene work was pretty tight.
2475160	2476160	Absolutely.
2476160	2477160	Pretty tight.
2478160	2481160	But your direction was that I should dress differently
2481160	2483160	and that the script should be better.
2488160	2490160	And then you asked for a job.
2490160	2491160	Yeah.
2491160	2493160	He certainly has the beard to be a director.
2493160	2494160	Yeah.
2494160	2495160	And then you came to Comic Con.
2495160	2498160	You were in the Rick and Morty panel at Comic Con.
2498160	2499160	Yeah, yeah.
2502160	2505160	What were you saying at the microphone?
2505160	2506160	To begin?
2506160	2510160	When you got to the microphone, what were you saying at the Rick and Morty panel?
2510160	2513160	I was saying that I had an Archer t-shirt.
2513160	2517160	You had an Archer t-shirt on and you were pointing at it.
2517160	2518160	Yeah.
2518160	2519160	But there was something...
2519160	2521160	Everyone thought that you were saying...
2522160	2523160	God damn it.
2523160	2525160	What does Archer t-shirt sound like?
2525160	2527160	Like Machu Picchu.
2527160	2530160	Oh, everyone was saying, is he saying Machu Picchu?
2530160	2532160	And I was pointing at his Archer t-shirt.
2533160	2536160	It's not really a story as much as it is just a slice of life.
2538160	2540160	Yeah, it's appropriate that you like Wes Anderson
2540160	2543160	because you're kind of a Wes Anderson character at this point.
2546160	2550160	So you go into UCLA, you're going to make...
2550160	2553160	But you want to direct TV, not movies, right?
2553160	2554160	I want to direct both.
2554160	2555160	Okay, both.
2555160	2556160	Fine.
2557160	2558160	All right.
2558160	2563160	How can we turn Anatoly into a thing that makes people clap?
2569160	2570160	Thank you, Anatoly.
2572160	2574160	All right. Thank you, Anatoly.
2575160	2576160	He's fucking...
2576160	2578160	He's 20 bucks in the black right now, man.
2578160	2579160	Yeah, that's true.
2580160	2583160	Anatoly, what are you going to do with all that money?
2584160	2585160	I will eat.
2585160	2586160	He will eat.
2589160	2591160	I like the name Anatoly.
2591160	2592160	I wish...
2593160	2595160	I'm going to name my son Anatoly.
2597160	2600160	In high school, I didn't like reading all that much
2600160	2601160	because I hated being told what to do,
2601160	2603160	but then I got crime and punishment by Dostoyevsky,
2603160	2605160	by this young teacher when I was a senior.
2605160	2607160	And that was the first book I really fell in love with.
2607160	2609160	And I became obsessed with Dostoyevsky,
2609160	2612160	then Tolstoy and Chekov, and I became this big Russophile.
2612160	2615160	And when I went to USC, I studied...
2615160	2617160	I took all these classes in Russian literature.
2617160	2619160	I went back and read some of the stuff I wrote.
2619160	2620160	I was smart back then.
2620160	2621160	I don't know shit anymore.
2621160	2624160	So hearing the name like Anatoly makes me think of it.
2624160	2625160	It's War and Peace.
2625160	2627160	It's an Anatoly in War and Peace, isn't it?
2627160	2628160	Yeah.
2628160	2629160	Yeah.
2629160	2630160	It's a huge book.
2630160	2632160	It's got to be, like, four.
2633160	2635160	It makes me miss the days when I was smart.
2637160	2638160	You're still smart.
2638160	2639160	I'm just saying I'm dumb.
2639160	2640160	I'm saying, like, when you're in college,
2640160	2641160	your brain is just like...
2641160	2642160	You're so active.
2642160	2643160	No, it is true.
2643160	2646160	If you're under 30, like, you don't know, man,
2646160	2647160	use it for something.
2648160	2650160	I mean, just use it to have fun or make stuff,
2650160	2652160	but you don't have to use it to, like, pick at anything.
2652160	2653160	Yeah, you had to work.
2653160	2655160	I worked so fucking hard in college.
2655160	2656160	I never want to work that hard again.
2656160	2657160	I think that's what it was.
2657160	2660160	Like, I worked and I got my A's and I just got out of there.
2660160	2662160	Like, I don't ever want that brain locked.
2662160	2663160	So you're right.
2663160	2666160	You force yourself into that procrastination fear,
2666160	2669160	that brain freeze of I'm out of ideas,
2669160	2671160	you hit those walls, things like that.
2671160	2672160	Like, I couldn't put myself through that.
2672160	2673160	Yeah.
2674160	2677160	I'm multitasking. I'm multitasking.
2677160	2680160	Well, then I'll ask you a question while you thumb through your phone,
2680160	2682160	your giant phone.
2682160	2684160	Ask me a question.
2684160	2686160	How big is your phone?
2686160	2689160	How's the writing coming on season five?
2689160	2690160	You know, it's...
2690160	2691160	Well, I mean, it's...
2691160	2694160	On Friday, they're applauding...
2694160	2695160	They didn't even know the answer yet.
2695160	2696160	Anticipation.
2699160	2702160	The new writers are coming along very nicely.
2702160	2708160	On Friday, like, a bunch of popcorn kernels popped at the same time.
2708160	2709160	We kind of closed out Friday,
2709160	2714160	like, realizing that we had a handle on several great episodes all at once.
2714160	2716160	And we wrote down on a party bus to Comic Con together.
2716160	2718160	I got to meet plenty of them.
2718160	2720160	Not all of them, probably, but a lot of them.
2720160	2721160	We're doing...
2721160	2724160	As I've announced, because you have to know this before...
2724160	2728160	Well, in advance, we're doing an animated episode this year.
2728160	2733160	And I will say, the animated episode we're doing this year,
2733160	2737160	even for this ridiculous show that we've been doing,
2737160	2739160	and all of its unmarketability,
2739160	2742160	our approach to doing the animated episode this season
2742160	2747160	is something that could definitely only be done in season five of Community.
2747160	2751160	Meaning that it's like, even in season three of Community,
2751160	2753160	people are like, okay, come on, knock it off.
2755160	2757160	But now they can't.
2758160	2761160	And I don't mean that it's just weird for weird's sake.
2761160	2762160	Quite the opposite.
2762160	2767160	I mean, it's like very profound, like, in a way that makes it not...
2767160	2769160	You know, it's like, this is a sitcom.
2769160	2771160	But it will also be incredibly funny.
2771160	2775160	It's going to be a fucking masterpiece if I do say so myself.
2778160	2783160	Everything sounds horrible when it's followed by applause like that.
2783160	2785160	Did you write this profound episode
2785160	2787160	after you got knocked out and saw the other side?
2787160	2788160	No, I didn't.
2788160	2791160	But I have all new angles on it now that I did.
2791160	2795160	But no, I mean, the thing that I'm most proud of is that I was...
2797160	2800160	This was after we kind of like started breaking up the rooms
2800160	2801160	and stuff with these writers.
2801160	2805160	Like, it's the thing that makes me so much happier than me
2805160	2808160	staring at a whiteboard and coming up with something
2808160	2811160	is when I leave a room for two hours and come back
2811160	2813160	and people have landed on something.
2813160	2816160	We just got some brilliant minds in there
2816160	2820160	that are really, really, really respectful of the medium
2820160	2823160	and have come up with some incredible shit.
2823160	2826160	Dino's going to... His name will be on the cover sheet.
2826160	2828160	Dino's going to write the animated episode.
2828160	2831160	But, I mean, we'll all be writing it together as all the episodes.
2831160	2833160	But it's going to be a goodie.
2833160	2834160	I feel comfortable guaranteeing that.
2834160	2836160	Can you say how many episodes in that will appear?
2836160	2838160	Actually, no, because we're going to make it stand alone.
2838160	2841160	It'll be production code 513 for you.
2841160	2844160	Community production code heads, I think you're called.
2844160	2847160	We freak out when you see the numbers are swapped and stuff.
2847160	2851160	Any numbers you see swapped are for a reason.
2851160	2854160	It's because the directors needed certain schedule and stuff like that.
2854160	2857160	We're giving the animated episode the last production code
2857160	2858160	so that we can put it in.
2858160	2860160	It's going to stand alone, kind of.
2860160	2863160	So, anyways, that's enough of that business.
2863160	2865160	What else was there?
2865160	2869160	Went to Comic Con, had a weird stomach ache in front of that panel,
2869160	2871160	an amazing panel, 6,500 people.
2871160	2875160	I felt something I never felt before, which is this weird...
2875160	2877160	Normally, being in front of 6,500 people
2877160	2880160	would be the most relaxing thing in the world for me.
2880160	2881160	That's my inverted personality.
2881160	2885160	I only know I exist when people are listening to me talk.
2885160	2887160	But I had this... I came up...
2887160	2893160	I just had this swell of just gastrointestinal tension.
2894160	2898160	I felt like the upper half of my stomach had done 1,000 sit-ups.
2898160	2901160	And I came off stage and explained that to Dino,
2901160	2904160	and he said, yeah, so you've got to watch what you say now.
2904160	2906160	That's what happens.
2906160	2908160	Oh, really? You think that was just like...
2908160	2911160	Yeah, because I was so forward to the Rick and Morty panel,
2911160	2913160	but now this community thing...
2913160	2916160	I'm sure it's all my fault. I'm not complaining about any of it,
2916160	2918160	but this is just the phenomenon that's happened.
2918160	2921160	There's so much more wrong I can do than right by talking.
2922160	2925160	6,500 people, and I'm just like...
2929160	2931160	Take one person that you could make cry
2931160	2933160	by saying the wrong combination of words,
2933160	2935160	whether that person is a Jeff Annie shipper
2935160	2940160	or a person who served proudly in our nation's armed services
2940160	2943160	or a double amputee
2943160	2947160	or a person that worked really hard on season four
2947160	2952160	or a victim of nonconsensual sex in the summer of 98
2952160	2956160	or someone that works for TV Guide
2956160	2960160	who really, really, really wants me to be an asshole.
2963160	2968160	I go 6,500 people, 6,500 chances to fuck up to say the wrong thing,
2968160	2969160	and I think I just...
2969160	2972160	My brain went, okay, well, you can't deal with that.
2972160	2976160	So I just pushed it all down into my little Tim Tums
2976160	2978160	Tim Tums?
2978160	2982160	That's where the cake in the vodka goes.
2982160	2984160	That's not for dealing.
2984160	2987160	But you don't feel that restriction in here,
2987160	2990160	but this podcast goes out to a lot more than 6,500 people.
2990160	2994160	Well, walking off that stage, I was like, fuck this.
2994160	2997160	I refuse to live my life feeling that way.
2997160	3001160	Fuck you. Fuck you in the teeth forever.
3001160	3002160	Right in the teeth.
3002160	3005160	If you would ever have anyone feel that way,
3005160	3010160	fuck you a million times in the big fat face.
3010160	3013160	Just fuck you for wanting people to feel bad.
3013160	3016160	I've never done anything to hurt anybody.
3016160	3020160	I've never said anything that I wanted to make people feel pain.
3020160	3023160	I just can't do it. I'd rather kill myself.
3023160	3026160	I'll never feel that way again. It's a horrible experience.
3026160	3027160	Okay, so...
3027160	3029160	Worse than being in San Diego itself.
3029160	3031160	That town is a fucking bummer.
3031160	3033160	I don't.
3034160	3036160	I'm talking about downtown San Diego.
3036160	3039160	Around San Diego is quite lovely.
3039160	3040160	Can you even call it a downtown?
3040160	3041160	Yeah.
3041160	3042160	I don't know, man.
3042160	3043160	There's too many people there.
3043160	3045160	It wasn't the Comic-Con's fault.
3045160	3047160	It wasn't the people's fault that was there.
3047160	3048160	You can't get a good bite to eat.
3048160	3051160	No, I've been there during non-Comic-Con.
3051160	3052160	I mean, it's not...
3052160	3055160	You got your San Francisco's, you got your Portland's,
3055160	3057160	you got your New York's, your L.A.'s,
3057160	3060160	your Asheville, North Carolina's.
3060160	3062160	Hipster towns.
3062160	3063160	San Diego is not a hipster town.
3063160	3064160	I don't know.
3064160	3067160	It's just a neutral setting of hostility there.
3067160	3069160	It's not because there's military bases.
3069160	3071160	The military people you meet in there are quite nice
3071160	3072160	and friendly and polite and cool.
3072160	3074160	Yeah, but the equipment the military is using
3074160	3078160	experimentally to enrage the populace.
3078160	3080160	You're familiar with harp.
3080160	3081160	I don't like it.
3081160	3082160	I got thrown out of a bar.
3082160	3083160	I wasn't doing anything.
3083160	3086160	I sassafrassed the bouncer.
3086160	3089160	I was standing kind of in the doorway.
3089160	3091160	I was not standing in the door jam.
3091160	3093160	I was two and a half feet back and a foot over to the side.
3093160	3095160	So three people could have walked abreast,
3095160	3098160	like through that doorway, and not bumped into me.
3098160	3099160	And a guy just came in.
3099160	3101160	I was the only guy in a suit and kind of a diving bar.
3101160	3103160	And this guy, they make all the bouncers there
3103160	3105160	wear shirts that say security on them,
3105160	3107160	and they all have ear monitors, and it's a little much.
3107160	3110160	And they card you just like Check Point Charlie.
3110160	3112160	Like, it's amazing.
3112160	3114160	Well, essentially, they're there for Comic-Con
3114160	3116160	because, you know, it's crowd control and stuff,
3116160	3117160	and that's cool.
3117160	3120160	But there was a guy dressed as the crow at the bar
3120160	3123160	who may dress like the crow every day
3123160	3126160	and was certainly acting like a guy who was like,
3126160	3128160	oh, I get to dress like the crow.
3128160	3129160	And he was like, brinking shit?
3129160	3131160	Nobody was sassafrassing him.
3131160	3132160	I was standing there in a suit.
3132160	3134160	I had some drinks, but I wasn't bothering anybody.
3134160	3135160	I was kind of just standing there.
3135160	3138160	And the guy looked, bro, you can't stand there.
3138160	3141160	And I looked down, and there was a little concrete square
3141160	3144160	kind of where the incline of the doorway comes in,
3144160	3146160	where they had to kind of pave that little way up.
3146160	3148160	And I was like right on the edge of that.
3148160	3151160	And so I just kind of semi-sarcastedly tiptoed
3151160	3152160	just out of it.
3152160	3154160	And he goes, keep moving, bro.
3154160	3157160	I'm like, you tell me, I'm going to keep tiptoeing,
3157160	3159160	and you tell me when to stop.
3159160	3161160	He's like, don't sass me, bro.
3161160	3162160	Don't sass me.
3162160	3167160	I'm like, look, not only would I never sass you, sir,
3167160	3170160	I have so much respect for you and what you're doing right now.
3170160	3173160	I just want to be the world's best customer at this bar.
3173160	3175160	And I want to know all the rules.
3175160	3176160	I want to know everything.
3176160	3178160	So I don't want to get this one wrong.
3178160	3179800	And he goes, is this OK?
3179800	3181800	And he's like, he just gave me the eyeball.
3181800	3184480	And then an hour later, I'm in the back,
3184480	3186200	leaning up against a stack of beer boxes,
3186200	3188040	texting my girlfriend, not doing anything.
3188040	3189080	Bro, you're wobbling.
3189080	3190960	You've got to go.
3190960	3194440	It took him an hour to get a head of steam or a couple
3194440	3195600	of shots of drone attack.
3195600	3198600	He just got fucking like, he was separated from the pack.
3198600	3200800	And then the thing's kind of politeness on my end
3200800	3203040	kind of went out the window at that point.
3203040	3204760	Yeah, I've seen you more sober, but I've
3204760	3206040	seen you a lot drunker.
3206040	3209120	And everyone in that bar was also drunker.
3209120	3211520	Like, I mean, you weren't doing anything wrong.
3211520	3212480	He goes, you're wobbling.
3212480	3213640	I go, I'm not wobbling.
3213640	3214880	You can't even talk right now.
3214880	3216120	You're slurring, bro.
3216120	3216800	I'm not slurring.
3216800	3217800	Yeah, you're slurring.
3217800	3218800	I go, you're a cunt.
3218800	3226560	And I go, can you read me?
3226560	3228360	Big Bunny, am I coming in?
3228360	3230560	And then right when you walk down the bar, what's going on?
3230560	3231360	This guy's a cunt.
3231360	3231960	Who's this guy?
3231960	3232920	Who's this guy's a cunt to?
3232920	3234440	I don't know, there's two guys.
3234440	3235880	This guy's a coward, because he did this.
3235880	3237920	We cocked his fist at me, and he didn't do anything.
3237920	3239040	So cunt, coward, cunt.
3242280	3246360	Look, don't throw me out of your bar.
3246360	3249960	Yeah, the people that go into that line of work.
3249960	3252880	All right, I mean, well, if you are a cool bouncer,
3252880	3254680	and I know there must be a lot of them,
3254680	3255880	because there's a lot of cool places to drink.
3255880	3256280	They generally are.
3256280	3257800	They don't work in San Diego, though.
3257800	3258600	Yeah, yeah.
3258600	3261280	Like, please thank you on behalf of all of us.
3261280	3261800	That's not true.
3261800	3264040	I've been a very nice bouncer who had the full thing.
3264040	3265600	And he was quite helpful and nice.
3265600	3268160	But he just looks like, I don't know, San Diego.
3268160	3270320	Too many sideways or backwards baseball hats
3270320	3274000	on white dudes with Crocs or flip-flops on.
3274000	3277880	San Diego may officially get the Jeff Davis patented thumbs
3277880	3279960	down and fart sound.
3279960	3281040	That means a lot to people.
3281040	3282040	It does.
3282040	3282320	What?
3282320	3283200	I'm not being sarcastic.
3283200	3284040	Thumbs down and fart sounds?
3284040	3284960	Thumbs down from Jeff.
3284960	3286560	Yeah, like, you know, Jeff.
3286560	3287400	I rarely do it.
3287400	3288720	It's not the whole.
3288720	3290680	San Diego's a giant county, and it's a big city.
3290680	3292480	There's whales that just got the thumbs down.
3292480	3293480	Like, you didn't even.
3293480	3294960	Don't get me started on Blackfish, man.
3294960	3296360	I just saw that yesterday.
3296360	3297440	You guys want to get it bummed out?
3297440	3297960	How was it?
3297960	3299320	It's a bummer.
3299320	3300160	You know about this movie?
3300160	3300680	No.
3300680	3301320	It's a documentary.
3301320	3302760	Is that like the Cove or something?
3302760	3303800	No, it's kind of.
3303800	3306040	It's the concrete pool.
3306040	3310480	It's about SeaWorld's treatment of orcas and the cover-ups
3310480	3313320	of the people that die training them there.
3313320	3314320	Wait, people die?
3314320	3315760	Yeah, yeah, they die.
3315760	3320760	And it's just like absolute PR, just thing.
3320760	3323240	Because the one way, I don't want to spoil it for everybody,
3323320	3327640	but there is one whale that ate a lady.
3327640	3329160	It was the most time much of a spoiler.
3329160	3330920	Yeah, and it's not because it's in the news and stuff
3330920	3331420	like that.
3331420	3334840	But what I did not know is this whale's backstory
3334840	3337200	is pretty fascinating.
3337200	3338560	And this whale has a backstory.
3338560	3342440	Apparently, it once walked on land
3342440	3344160	and looked much like a Pranasaurus.
3344160	3345920	All right, well, let's bring up the rest
3345920	3350240	of our little rascals and get their two cents on everything
3350240	3351120	that's happened tonight.
3351120	3352160	Kumail Nanjiani.
3352880	3354880	We missed you.
3354880	3358880	Kona O'Brien's Kumail Nanjiani.
3358880	3359880	Kona O'Brien's Kumail.
3359880	3360880	It's been a while.
3360880	3361880	You know what?
3361880	3365880	Can I say, it kind of fucked San Diego.
3365880	3369880	Would you fuck it right in the teeth?
3369880	3372880	Would you fuck it with a side of beef?
3372880	3374880	Would you fuck it on a bagel?
3374880	3378880	I would fuck it till it queefed.
3378880	3380880	I like your meter.
3381120	3383320	I like your meter.
3383320	3384960	ABC beef.
3384960	3389120	That was kind of a haiku we had today.
3389120	3390040	I was at Comic Con.
3390040	3390520	I went to see.
3390520	3391680	I didn't run into you.
3391680	3393720	So it's like super packed.
3393720	3396400	So I was with my wife, and we were walking side by side.
3396400	3398480	And it's just a ton of people around.
3398480	3400720	And Emily looked at me, and she's like,
3400720	3404400	there's a guy with his crotch on my butt right now,
3404400	3406320	right behind me.
3406320	3408320	So I looked back to sort of see, because I'm
3408320	3410600	expecting a huge crowd.
3410600	3411840	It was just one guy.
3414480	3418880	It was me, Emily, and then just one guy, nobody else around,
3418880	3424600	just like a butt backpack, just attached to her.
3424600	3430600	The rules of society kind of don't apply at Comic Con.
3430600	3433640	The weird thing that's starting to happen now is that,
3433640	3436080	because I'm old.
3436080	3439040	I was there in the 90s when I was signing comic books.
3439040	3441160	There was a Marvel Center.
3441160	3444000	There were video game consoles being sold there.
3444000	3450000	But we nerds were allowed to sit on the floor of hallways
3450000	3454480	with our big bags of shit that we bought and our nerd Mecca
3454480	3455720	and go through shit.
3455720	3458200	And then there was a tipping point that got crossed,
3458200	3460320	I don't know, let's say six years ago, I have no idea,
3460320	3460880	whenever.
3460880	3462960	I mean, there was just a point where it was like,
3462960	3464800	this movie has nothing to do with comic books,
3464800	3466480	but it's premiering here anywhere.
3466480	3468360	I realize community is part of the problem.
3468800	3471520	I returned to this Sundance of things.
3471520	3474760	But now you just get cattle prodded if you're a nerd
3474760	3476240	and you try to sit down anywhere.
3476240	3478240	They're like, keep it moving, keep it moving.
3478240	3480920	And it's like, and yeah, I really
3480920	3482880	hate the booth babes thing.
3482880	3486040	That is so fucking gross to me, all those like,
3486040	3488400	I feel horrible for them too, because they're
3488400	3490440	like, this is the three days of the year
3490440	3492120	where they definitely have work.
3492120	3496200	But if you go day three, their eyes are so sad.
3496280	3498680	But there's also now, it's almost
3498680	3501360	like it's the worst of all worlds,
3501360	3504880	because it was nerd Mecca, but now it's nerd Sundance.
3504880	3506440	And now, because it's nerd Sundance,
3506440	3507600	it's a form of Sundance.
3507600	3510640	So now there's this douchey component coming in.
3510640	3512920	I was in a pizza parlor, and there
3512920	3514840	were two girls who were in costume,
3514840	3517360	and they didn't know each other, but some guys
3517360	3519560	wanted pictures with them.
3519560	3522560	And then another guy, with a backwards baseball cap
3523000	3526280	and some crocs and some flip flops and some flute flukes,
3526280	3528920	who was sitting in the pizza parlor, he started yelling out.
3528920	3531280	He's like, make out, make out.
3531280	3532840	And I was like, oh, well, whatever.
3532840	3535480	San Diego meets Comic Con.
3535480	3536600	He had laminates on.
3536600	3538400	He was a fucking Comic Con guy.
3538400	3543200	He was just there to see fucking Ben Affleck 3,
3543200	3545520	or whatever is premiering there.
3545520	3549040	Are we already at Ben Affleck 3?
3549040	3549840	You know what?
3550280	3555080	We had Ben Affleck 1 was like mall rats and stuff.
3555080	3558760	Then Ben Affleck 2 was Good Will Hunting.
3558760	3560680	And now Argo is Ben Affleck 3.
3560680	3561800	This is Ben Affleck 3D.
3561800	3564160	Well, now he's directing, and he's got a beard.
3564160	3566960	OK.
3566960	3569040	I forgot to bring out the list of our little wascals.
3569040	3572160	We got to get Darla and Spanky out here.
3572160	3573040	Aaron McGathey.
3573040	3583880	And Spencer Crittenden, our dungeon master.
3592280	3597160	Aaron, you have to stand back in the booth
3597160	3598800	and listen to me talk for an hour.
3598800	3601080	Anything you want to feed back on?
3601080	3607160	I'm from San Diego, and I couldn't agree more.
3610760	3612600	It is like a douchey.
3612600	3615840	Comic Con is very different than what that town's vibe is,
3615840	3616400	generally.
3616400	3616880	Yeah.
3616880	3622840	I mean, as a high schooler there who felt like an outcast,
3622840	3625600	being really hot and sick, I mean,
3625600	3628440	the problem is that it's so beautiful in San Diego
3628440	3632760	that there's no real art or theater scene that's
3632760	3635120	supported as much as it should be because everyone's like,
3635120	3638000	let's just jet ski.
3638000	3640680	And it's a big retirement community.
3640680	3644080	Also, it's so hot there that if you're a fat 15-year-old
3644080	3647080	and you're wearing sweatshirts, everyone notices.
3647080	3650800	And you can't really fly under the radar.
3650800	3654120	Being unique is not valued in San Diego.
3654120	3659120	But shout out to the two people I still talk to there.
3659120	3661320	The guy in the joker right away, sweetie.
3661320	3662800	It is Ray Mysterio.
3662800	3663600	Sorry?
3663600	3667640	Ray Mysterio, he talked to 15-year-olds now.
3667640	3668720	That's why I'm not.
3668720	3671720	I mean, San Diego obviously has cool parts to it.
3671720	3678120	But there is a big value put on conformity and being
3678120	3679960	able to wear a mid-drift.
3679960	3681320	Seafood.
3681320	3682120	Seafood.
3682120	3683480	And backwards, backwards, and backwards.
3683480	3685040	There's a big jock culture there.
3685040	3687640	And I think it is due in part to the military bases,
3687640	3688440	which is fine.
3688440	3690080	I come from a military family.
3690080	3692320	And I'm not saying that the military is bad or anything.
3692320	3694280	But there is a big macho.
3694280	3696160	I'm saying the whole level of douchebaggery
3696160	3697120	that I have noticed down there.
3697120	3698520	My brother went to college there.
3698520	3699360	So I was down there a lot.
3699360	3701800	And I used to go down there for lots of reasons and stuff.
3701800	3704120	You don't see fights in bars in Los Angeles.
3704120	3705480	Almost never.
3705480	3706960	I don't know what that's about.
3706960	3708800	Because then we wanted to protect their face.
3708800	3709640	That's their life.
3710280	3716160	But even in dodgy bars where people are already beat up,
3716160	3720120	I think there's a level of like, he might shoot me.
3720120	3723120	Or I'll be looking over my shoulder
3723120	3725120	for the rest of my life if I do that.
3725120	3728160	But at San Diego, people fight in bars.
3728160	3730320	It's just a weird tension and a hostility
3730320	3732680	that I cannot get on board with.
3732680	3733880	By the way, can I say something?
3733880	3736960	This is changing the subject, is that when you woke up,
3736960	3740120	I've heard that anesthesia, that when you wake up,
3740120	3743320	different parts of your brain wakes up at different times.
3743320	3745560	And so the part that is more aggressive
3745560	3748360	wakes up before the part that sort of controls that.
3748360	3752920	So the part that was like, give me my phone, I'm a writer.
3752920	3756240	Yeah, so that was just brain chemistry, man.
3756240	3757120	That's not on you.
3757360	3757840	All right.
3764560	3767520	I punched my mom after I came out of a.
3767520	3768920	You punched your mom?
3768920	3769880	I was 12.
3769880	3772080	No, don't boo that.
3772080	3773400	Here, there's still.
3773400	3775880	You haven't met her.
3775880	3778080	Jeff, you can't say anything.
3778080	3780120	Jeff, look what time it is.
3780120	3781120	I have to be honest.
3781120	3782440	I looked over a minute ago.
3782440	3785160	It was 9 10.
3785880	3790200	Whoever booed you punching your mom, I have to boo them.
3790200	3791680	Boo.
3791680	3793800	Yeah, I apologize afterwards.
3793800	3795160	I don't remember doing it.
3795160	3796760	Also, obviously, if you can tell people
3796760	3799320	that you punched your mom, you're not going, hey,
3799320	3801600	it's something you should cheer.
3801600	3803040	Yeah, I'll be revealing it.
3803040	3804400	It might have been an ironic boo.
3804400	3806040	I think people are having fun with it.
3806040	3807600	Well, now I boo your.
3807600	3810680	It's a very vocal audience we were commenting.
3810680	3812160	Yeah, well, I've engaged them.
3812160	3815040	They can sense what happened to me
3815040	3819600	at Comic Con, or they can sense what happened to me in oblivion.
3819600	3821560	You know what, I know exactly what you feel.
3821560	3826280	It feels like when you get, I was like 12 when I had surgery,
3826280	3828120	and I had like ear problems my whole life.
3828120	3829520	And I would get these horrible ear aches.
3829520	3830920	And I was like, when you're old enough to have surgery,
3830920	3832160	when you're old enough to have surgery.
3832160	3833680	And when I was 12, I was old enough.
3833680	3835120	And I was planned for months.
3835120	3836200	And I was there waiting.
3836200	3838120	And the doctors came in in scrubs.
3838120	3840480	And they were like, hey, do you want to go to the circus?
3840480	3842600	And I was like, fuck you.
3843080	3846680	But I went in, and they strapped me down.
3846680	3849560	And I fought, and they put the mask on my face.
3849560	3851760	And then when I blow, there'll be a balloon.
3851760	3856280	One, I'm too old at this point to give a shit about a balloon.
3856280	3859320	And I remember blowing as hard as I can at being like, there's no balloon.
3859320	3860680	I'm like screaming it.
3860680	3865480	But it feels like such a violation that they can put you out that hard.
3865480	3870160	When I woke up, I was like angry that they have the ability to do that to me.
3870160	3871960	Like I have favorite ice cream flavors and shit.
3871960	3873160	And you took it all away.
3873160	3877000	Well, to be clear, I didn't feel that way at all.
3877000	3881640	I was so grateful for Western medicine and all that it.
3881640	3883720	You left balloons.
3883720	3886080	I didn't want things that you're going to start to feel drowsy.
3886080	3889720	And I was so grateful.
3889720	3891720	Like three seconds, and then blink.
3891720	3894000	And then I heard like a beep, beep.
3894000	3896400	And it felt like I could hear beeping for a while.
3896400	3901720	And then to wake up in a crib pushed by ladies smiling and going.
3901720	3903840	Did I die and go to heaven?
3903840	3906440	I had a camera down my throat, and I didn't know.
3906440	3907440	I was very grateful.
3907440	3908520	No, I liked that I was out.
3908520	3913000	But I just was a little like I had all my wisdom teeth out last year.
3913000	3914640	And I was like, don't put me under.
3914640	3916280	In one go?
3916280	3919080	Yeah, no, in a couple of different goes.
3919080	3920480	You opted to be awake?
3920480	3923400	Well, I hadn't gone to the dentist in like 15 years.
3923400	3924680	And I was at a burger place.
3924680	3930160	And it said, get the buffalo burger if the Native Americans only ate buffalo.
3930160	3933840	And if they had proper dental care, they would have lived to be 120 or something.
3933840	3935960	So I was like, shit, I got to, you know.
3935960	3938120	What restaurant was this?
3938120	3941400	It's called the Fix Burger.
3941400	3943040	So I went to the dentist.
3943040	3945400	And I was like, hey, it's just a regular checkup.
3945400	3949680	And she was like, emergency dental surgery right now.
3949680	3951480	Your mouth is a cave of nightmares.
3955480	3957800	I knew it was going to be bad because she was giving me symptoms.
3957800	3961040	I said, if I ate ice cream on the left side of my mouth, my spine hurts.
3969040	3971880	You might be a redneck.
3971880	3973680	So I had months of surgery for that.
3973680	3976920	And I didn't want to go under because that time when I was 12, it felt, to me,
3976920	3978080	it felt like a violation.
3978080	3979480	But that's very interesting to me.
3979480	3983240	I mean, there's a fork on the road there.
3983320	3993360	The fact that you felt, my terror, my, like, I want to be out because I don't want any
3993360	3994360	of it to be happening.
3994360	3995360	Yeah.
3995360	4000000	But you, but you're like, I didn't want to be there for it, but I didn't want to get
4000000	4001000	put under.
4001000	4004200	And then while it's happening, I regretted it because they were playing 13 going on
4004200	4007840	30 the whole time.
4007840	4012600	And I was like, this dental surgery is the second worst thing I'm going through right
4013160	4014160	now.
4014160	4015160	Spencer, have you ever been knocked out?
4015160	4017320	I'm on stage two.
4017320	4021800	That's, that's not a, that's not a complaint.
4021800	4022800	That's not a complaint.
4022800	4027920	That's just a clarification for our podcast listeners because they heard an applause.
4027920	4028920	Spencer has.
4028920	4032440	For those of you that never been to or seen a picture of Spencer's at the kids table over
4032440	4033440	on the side.
4033440	4034440	Yeah.
4034440	4035440	No, I'm that wasn't a complaint.
4035440	4036440	I promise.
4036440	4037440	I'm not.
4037440	4038440	I'm fine.
4038440	4039440	I've been surgered before.
4039440	4040440	You've been surgered.
4040440	4041440	Yeah.
4041440	4042440	What was it?
4043280	4044280	Conjugate that.
4044280	4045280	Why not?
4045280	4046280	Who cares?
4046280	4047280	You can barber.
4047280	4048280	Do you know what I said?
4048280	4049280	It's a sewing truck.
4049280	4050280	It just, I mean, it made sense.
4050280	4051280	Right?
4051280	4052280	Yeah.
4052280	4053280	That's all that counts.
4053280	4055280	That's the beautiful thing about the English language.
4055280	4064080	Spencer and Jeff have been fighting all day just so you guys know, I've had all my wisdom
4064080	4065800	teeth out.
4065800	4067520	That was crazy.
4067520	4072000	I've had a, okay, everybody in the audience has to be honest.
4072000	4074360	Does anyone know what a pilonidal cyst is?
4074360	4075360	Yeah.
4075360	4076360	Yeah.
4076360	4077360	Yeah.
4077360	4078360	Yeah.
4078360	4082560	It's not fun, but it's also not terrible, but I had one of those dealt with.
4082560	4083800	It's a cyst up your butt.
4083800	4086480	That's interesting because I would think most things to do with your butt would either be
4086480	4087960	great or terrible.
4087960	4088960	Yeah.
4088960	4093360	And this is like, I'd say it's the most, you know, ambivalent thing you could do with your
4093360	4094360	butt.
4094360	4095360	You could take it or leave it.
4095360	4096360	Yeah.
4096360	4098920	Well, that's the weird, weird, weird thing about it because you could like, depending
4098920	4103840	on, you know, the intensity, sometimes it's better to not have it operated on.
4103840	4106040	And sometimes it's better to have it operated on.
4106040	4107040	What is it?
4107040	4108120	It's a cyst up in your butthole.
4108120	4112680	It's like, it's like, it's like, you know, if you have an ingrown hair and it kind of
4112680	4115640	becomes infected and then if you squeeze it, the hair comes out and there's a tiny little
4115640	4116640	bit of pus.
4116640	4121040	It's like that in that it develops this kind of channel from your hair follicle that gets
4121040	4123560	infected in your butt.
4123560	4124680	The whole thing is in your butt.
4124680	4126440	Well, it's a central, not in your butt.
4126440	4127960	It's in the butt crack.
4128480	4129480	Oh, so not the hole.
4129480	4130480	Yeah, no, above it.
4130480	4131480	Like lower back.
4131480	4132480	It's in the runway.
4132480	4133480	Lower back.
4134480	4136480	Depends on, you know, which direction it approaches.
4136480	4141440	My confusion is though, why would they bother to call it a special kind of cyst when it's
4141440	4145720	just, well, a cyst implies it's like, you know, in my mind it's like, like kind of like
4145720	4150560	a growth, like a tumorous growth, but it's more like just like a little opening, like
4150560	4152760	a little...
4152760	4154840	What was the word you said before cysts?
4154840	4156360	Pylonidol.
4156360	4157360	Go away.
4158160	4159160	Spencer's dad has...
4159160	4160160	Spencer's dad is...
4160160	4161160	Hold on.
4161160	4162160	Hold on.
4162160	4163160	Let me explain this.
4163160	4165280	My dad also had to deal with this.
4165280	4166280	That's all he's going to contribute.
4166280	4167280	Spencer's dad has just...
4167280	4169280	Because we could stop there.
4169280	4170280	Spencer's dad just kind of...
4170280	4171280	Right?
4171280	4172280	Spencer's dad is migrating the stage?
4172280	4174360	See, he's had a couple.
4174360	4175360	There you go.
4177360	4178360	That was...
4181360	4182360	So much to talk about.
4182360	4184360	Thank you, Mr. Crittenden.
4184360	4188360	My mom came over to my house today to drop off some t-shirts.
4188360	4189360	All right.
4189360	4191360	But she stayed there.
4191360	4194360	Spencer...
4194360	4197360	I can't get her out of the chimney.
4197360	4199360	No, she left eventually.
4199360	4200360	Well, I'm...
4200360	4202360	I'm ornery about my parents.
4202360	4205360	Well, you can tell me a drag at your age, you know?
4205360	4206360	Yeah.
4206360	4207360	You want some elbow room.
4207360	4208360	It's literally...
4208360	4209360	Yeah.
4209360	4210360	You saw me elbowing him.
4210360	4213360	Well, you moved out of your parents' home at 23, 24 years old?
4213360	4214360	Yeah.
4214360	4215360	And...
4215360	4216360	So what's the problem now?
4216360	4217360	Are they happy you're gone?
4217360	4218360	Sad you're gone?
4218360	4222360	I just don't, you know, communicate with them like most people communicate with their parents.
4222360	4226360	So, you know, I'm like, let's just do it that way.
4226360	4227360	And that's how I do it.
4227360	4229360	And they're going through maybe a little bit of like...
4229360	4231360	Well, yeah, because I'm great.
4231360	4232360	Right.
4232360	4233360	Yes.
4233360	4237360	I would guess without knowing that you probably brought some structure in order possibly to
4237360	4238360	the household maybe, right?
4238360	4239360	I'd like to think so.
4239360	4240360	Yeah.
4240360	4242360	Hey, before we move...
4242360	4244360	Do you want to finish telling us about the...
4244360	4245360	Yeah.
4245360	4248360	Well, it just happened and, you know, you could get it cut out or not.
4248360	4254360	Does the word that you said before the word cyst, does that word mean in the butt crack?
4254360	4255360	No, it's really gross.
4255360	4258360	It means nest of hair.
4258360	4259360	It doesn't...
4259360	4260360	So it has not...
4260360	4261360	It's not an accurate depiction.
4261360	4264360	The fact that it was in your butt crack has nothing to...
4264360	4265360	That's just incidental, right?
4265360	4266360	No, it's because...
4266360	4267360	You could get one of these on your chest.
4267360	4268360	You could get one on your arm.
4268360	4270360	You called my asshole a nest of hair.
4270360	4272360	A pilonitis.
4272360	4276360	The word nest implies that there's creatures dwelling.
4276360	4277360	That somebody made it.
4277360	4280360	That's why it's gross, but I know what it means, so I'm not just going to be like, I don't
4280360	4281360	know what it means.
4281360	4285360	Have you guys seen the new CW show, Nest of Hair?
4285360	4288360	It's about San Diego.
4288360	4290360	But I'm still...
4290360	4294360	I mean, I want to know...
4294360	4297360	Does that word mean in the butt crack or does it...
4297360	4298360	No, it means nest of hair.
4298360	4300360	Is it something that only happens in the butt crack?
4300360	4302360	Yeah, because that's where there's friction.
4302360	4303360	That's why there's a nest of hair.
4303360	4307360	And when you're sitting, you know, when you're sitting, that's where sometimes sweat collects.
4307360	4311360	And if you're in a car or a vehicle, you know, there's agitation when you're bouncing in
4311360	4312360	the car.
4312360	4316360	And that's why a lot of GIs get it and it's known as Jeep butt.
4316360	4317360	Jeep butt.
4317360	4318360	Yeah.
4318360	4321360	That's a lot less disgusting than a pilonidal cyst.
4321360	4324360	Sometimes you'll see a family of finches fly out of your pants.
4324360	4325360	Yeah.
4325360	4326360	They come and go.
4326360	4327360	Jeep butt.
4327360	4330360	Could you have one of those and then it goes away and then it comes back or something like
4330360	4331360	that?
4331360	4332360	Yeah.
4332360	4333360	It's like a pimple in that, like, you know, it just...
4333360	4336480	It'll get bigger and then it'll pop and then it'll go away.
4336480	4339260	Or sometimes in rare cases, it could get infected like a pimple.
4339260	4340840	You know, like an opening in the skin.
4340840	4343040	And this is something you had to get surgied.
4343040	4344040	It will...
4344040	4347560	They recommended it and we did it, but you don't need to.
4347560	4349040	Like it kind of depends.
4349040	4350200	It's a case-by-case basis.
4350200	4354680	But essentially, what they do is way worse because it's like this tiny hole in your skin
4354680	4355800	on your butt.
4355800	4358480	And what they do is they cut out like a wedge of it.
4358480	4362680	It's like, you know, when you transplant a plant where you just take a huge scoop of
4362680	4364240	earth out from around it.
4364240	4367080	So you have a slightly bigger butt than you used to?
4367080	4372080	No, because they seal it back together and they literally use, like, glue, like this
4372080	4374840	crazy adhesive glue stuff and they glue it back together.
4374840	4379560	All this feels like you just went to a weird frat party.
4379560	4385680	I mean, arguably, isn't doctoring fraternity?
4385680	4388960	Is that your mom?
4388960	4389960	I'm sure.
4389960	4390960	A gal from the audience...
4390960	4394280	It is a woman, but...
4394280	4400120	Somebody's boasting that her nest of hair Jeep butt pimple was worse than yours.
4400120	4403080	I don't doubt that.
4403080	4406080	So they scoop out a hole and then they glue it back together.
4406080	4408840	Dan, are you so interested in this because you want it to be knocked out again?
4408840	4410600	Are you looking for...
4410600	4412480	You're wondering if you have a nest of hair.
4412480	4413480	Yeah.
4413480	4415920	I am a nest of hair.
4415920	4416920	That's...
4416920	4417920	Okay.
4417920	4418920	All right.
4418920	4422720	Well, so you've been knocked out while they did that.
4422720	4423720	Yeah.
4423720	4425920	Did you find it to be a profound experience?
4425920	4426920	No.
4426920	4431120	It's a lot like...
4431120	4432120	I don't dream very...
4432120	4435320	I mean, everyone's going to be like, everybody dreams.
4435320	4436960	I don't really, you know, dream, but...
4436960	4437960	Me neither.
4437960	4438960	I don't dream that much at all.
4438960	4439960	Yeah.
4439960	4440960	Like, it's not like it never happens, but, you know...
4440960	4443040	It's because you guys are living your dreams when you're awake.
4443600	4444600	Oh, Dan.
4444600	4447040	No, I'm not even trying to be weird.
4447040	4449040	Well, you succeeded.
4449040	4450040	Great.
4450040	4451040	Yeah.
4451040	4453280	I don't know.
4453280	4454280	That's probably why.
4454280	4455280	What?
4455280	4456280	That doesn't make it...
4456280	4457280	Whatever.
4457280	4458280	What I'm saying is I think...
4458280	4459280	I get what you're saying.
4459280	4461540	I think when you're dreaming, your brain's like getting off excess energy and I feel
4461540	4464800	like if you're already using that when you're awake, maybe there's not as much to give
4464800	4465800	off when you're asleep.
4465800	4466800	Well, I like that.
4466800	4470800	I like that a lot more than I thought it meant what it meant initially.
4470800	4471800	Your brain is dead.
4471800	4472800	Yeah.
4473560	4474560	Well, just when you're asleep.
4474560	4475560	Yeah.
4475560	4477000	Because it's so awake when you're awake.
4477000	4478000	That's what he's saying.
4478000	4479000	Yeah.
4479000	4480000	That's good.
4480000	4481000	Yeah.
4481000	4482000	I dreamt that was Batman a couple of nights ago.
4482000	4483000	Whoo!
4483000	4488000	Now, if we know your history of psychic stuff, does that mean that's going to happen?
4488000	4491000	Wait, but there was a crime that was committed.
4491000	4492000	Uh-oh.
4492000	4493000	Fucking tell us, dude.
4493000	4495720	You're just having an espresso in an Italian cafe.
4495720	4497800	We don't need you to sleep on another 9-11 here.
4497800	4498800	Thing was...
4499800	4508040	I was Batman, and I was wrongly convicted of accused of a crime that I didn't commit
4508040	4510080	like by a supervillain, maybe.
4510080	4511240	And this is definitely...
4511240	4516280	I had watched Robocop the night before, so I think this is a Robocop dream.
4516280	4520600	But then I had to hide dressed like a regular person and go through an airport, and I got
4520600	4522000	held by security at an airport.
4522000	4523000	So let's hope the airport...
4523000	4526200	Oh, this was days ago, so we're all in the clear.
4526200	4527200	Okay.
4527200	4528200	Couple days ago.
4528200	4529200	Did you plug something?
4529200	4530200	Yeah.
4530200	4535240	Is it Spencer's Nest of Hair?
4535240	4538600	Is that like a butt plug sort of play on words thing?
4538600	4540600	Yeah, I've had a few.
4540600	4542600	Oh, I'll just...
4542600	4543680	Two people plug?
4543680	4544680	That's okay, right?
4544680	4545680	Yeah, go ahead.
4545680	4547800	I had a special come out on Comedy Central.
4547800	4550800	It's called Beta Mail.
4550800	4556880	If you go to ccdirect.com, it's $5.
4556880	4558440	It's the cheapest way to get it.
4558440	4559760	Or you could torrent it.
4559760	4560760	I don't care.
4560760	4563760	I don't really get that money.
4563760	4565880	The people in back love torrenting.
4565880	4566880	That makes sense.
4566880	4571280	The people who got here later.
4571280	4572280	They know the ropes.
4572280	4576400	And so this was a big deal for me who was airing, and I told my parents to watch it.
4576400	4578040	And the next day I got a text from my parents.
4578040	4581320	This is sort of shows what my relationship with them is like.
4581320	4584320	It just said, saw your program.
4584320	4591320	I think we may be brother and sister.
4591320	4592320	Yeah, is it like that?
4592320	4595320	Does this go back to the punch that happened when you were 12?
4595320	4596320	Maybe.
4596320	4599320	So you woke up, you socked your mom, and was there a melee?
4599320	4600320	Did she fire back?
4600320	4601320	Was there a scuff?
4601320	4603320	I think she's still firing back.
4603320	4604320	Was there any?
4604320	4605320	Did you follow up?
4605320	4606320	Did you text back?
4606320	4607320	No, I didn't talk to them.
4607320	4608320	Was it like an uppercut?
4608320	4609320	No, no.
4610320	4611320	It's not your program.
4611320	4613320	Yeah, that was her punching back.
4613320	4618320	I didn't talk to them for a week, and then I talked to them today, and it wasn't brought
4618320	4619320	up.
4619320	4623320	As a comedian, doing Letterman is the biggest thing you can do.
4623320	4625320	And I was like, all right, I finally do something.
4625320	4627320	Did they know what Letterman is?
4627320	4628320	I do other shit.
4628320	4631320	They don't know very much about pop culture, but they know Letterman.
4631320	4632320	So I did Letterman.
4632320	4636320	I talked to them on the phone, and they were like, hey, we saw you on Letterman.
4636320	4640320	And then just told some story about my aunt.
4640320	4643320	I was like, I don't know what's happening.
4643320	4649320	What could you say to them that would make them very proud, like in a sentence?
4649320	4651320	I'm Muslim.
4655320	4661320	All right, Spencer, do you want to dispense the character sheets and get this D&D session
4661320	4662320	underway?
4662320	4663320	More dispenser.
4663320	4664320	Sure, why not?
4664320	4669320	Also, while he does that, it's probably a good time to plug the fact that we're finally
4669320	4671320	getting that stuff underway.
4671320	4676320	We're recording what's called Harmon Quest right now.
4676320	4682320	We're recording this D&D thing that we've been alluding to forever.
4682320	4684320	Spencer's dungeon mastering.
4684320	4690320	We're playing D&D and recording the audio in front of a live audience, just as we do
4690320	4697320	here, only we're doing it on a little bit of a budget with some of our favorite comedic
4697320	4704320	cameo people at the silent movie theater in combination with screenings of crazy fantasy-themed
4704320	4705320	movies.
4705320	4709320	And then we're going to take the audio from the role-playing sessions, give it to my studio
4709320	4713320	Starburns, and they're going to stop motion animate the combat and stuff.
4713320	4718320	It's going to be an awesome...
4718320	4722320	So if you want to be part of that, check online.
4722320	4723320	It's called Harmon Quest.
4723320	4724320	It's at CineFamily.
4724320	4727160	It's being done in conjunction with CineFamily.
4727160	4731320	That's why we're doing the fantasy-themed movies and stuff.
4731320	4733620	When's the first one coming up?
4733620	4735800	That's this coming Saturday.
4735800	4737840	Is there money?
4737840	4740640	Does it cost money to get in?
4740640	4742320	How much does it cost to get in?
4742320	4743320	Eighty dollars.
4743320	4746320	I see the movie ticket.
4746320	4747320	Fourteen dollars.
4748320	4749320	That's a bargain.
4749320	4752320	But if you're Anatolia, you make thirty-eight.
4752320	4755320	Yeah, you know, I was thinking about that.
4755320	4758320	I've performed like sixty episodes.
4758320	4760320	No, but yeah.
4760320	4762320	www.cinefamily.org.
4762320	4766320	That's www.cinefamily.org.
4771320	4773320	You're an Excalibur, right?
4773320	4776320	I think the first one might be Excalibur.
4776320	4777320	Yeah.
4777320	4778320	Oh, the first film?
4778320	4779320	The first film is Excalibur.
4779320	4782320	And the first guest is...
4785320	4788320	Adam Sandler is going to be there.
4788320	4789320	No shit!
4789320	4790320	Now you have to get Adam Sandler.
4790320	4793320	The first guests, the first night's guests,
4793320	4796320	are Blake Anderson from Workaholics and Kumail Nanjiani.
4796320	4798320	Kumail Nanjiani!
4798320	4801320	From Conan O'Brien.
4801320	4802320	All right, we plugged in.
4802320	4803320	Spencer, shall we get underway here?
4803320	4804320	Sure.
4804320	4805320	And if you pass the sheets down,
4805320	4808320	I will give Spencer his theme music and we can get this rolling.
4810320	4811320	Yeah!
4811320	4816320	Last time, our heroes were on the road to Fornheim
4816320	4820320	to end their fight with Admiral Darkstar.
4820320	4823320	As they traveled north, they went up into the mountains
4823320	4826320	towards Fornheim, the frozen city.
4826320	4830320	Yours had suggested they stop there to ask for an army
4830320	4835320	or maybe horses or some form of other-style aid from the city.
4835320	4839320	And after many days, there they trekked high up mountains
4839320	4843320	and up onto a specific mountain range in particular.
4843320	4846320	But there, they encountered a deadly blizzard.
4846320	4848320	Blizzard? What the fuck?
4848320	4851320	But through the driving snow and ice,
4851320	4854320	they could see the white walls of the frozen fortress.
4854320	4856320	There was a bridge.
4856320	4859320	Quark was suspicious, but Sharpie pushed on.
4859320	4862320	They started to cross the bridge.
4862320	4864320	They did not finish crossing the bridge.
4864320	4868320	From afar, the city fired cannons and skeletons landed in the ice.
4868320	4871320	Sharpie tried to reason, but Quark leapt into action,
4871320	4872320	tackling one of them.
4872320	4873320	And the gang was fighting.
4873320	4876320	The skeletons attacked with wicked blows.
4876320	4878320	Mo-Rein understood the beast's rage
4878320	4882320	and looked into its dead eyes in empathy.
4883320	4888320	Sharpie grasped one of the skeletons with a shocking grasp,
4888320	4891320	surging electrical energy through its brittle bones,
4891320	4894320	causing it to cause fire and fall on the floor.
4894320	4896320	Two skeletons remained.
4896320	4897320	What would they do?
4897320	4900320	Combat is happening now.
4907320	4909320	All right, two skeletons left.
4909320	4910320	Easy?
4910320	4912320	Yeah, we're on an icy bridge.
4912320	4913320	Who's up first, Spencer?
4913320	4915320	Quark, you are wrestling with one of them.
4915320	4917320	You're currently wrestling him,
4917320	4919320	and you're trying to throw him off the bridge.
4919320	4921320	Okay, I just try to grapple him and just throw him off the side.
4921320	4923320	Yeah.
4923320	4925320	All right, that happens.
4925320	4926320	Whoo-hoo!
4926320	4927320	Nice.
4927320	4930320	Grappling with the skeleton, you get the upper hand.
4930320	4932320	Did you just drop your... That's awesome.
4932320	4933320	Sorry.
4933320	4935320	You get the upper hand, you drop to the floor,
4935320	4937320	and then throw him over your shoulder,
4937320	4942320	and he goes sailing off the white edge of the icy bridge to the abyss.
4942320	4943320	I yell,
4943320	4945320	Second!
4946320	4948320	One skeleton remains.
4948320	4950320	Whose turn is it?
4950320	4951320	That'd be yours.
4951320	4953320	Okay.
4953320	4955320	How close are we to the skeletons?
4955320	4957320	You're about 25 feet off.
4957320	4960320	It's kind of engaged with mole rain right now and Sharpie,
4960320	4962320	but you're a bit off.
4962320	4963320	I'm a bit off?
4963320	4964320	Yeah.
4964320	4965320	He was always there.
4965320	4966320	Okay.
4966320	4967320	Everybody shut up.
4969320	4972320	I do, I mean, I take my poison dagger.
4972320	4973320	Will that work?
4973320	4975320	Take that poison dagger through my heart.
4975320	4976320	Okay.
4976320	4978320	Oh, the poison won't, but the dagger won't.
4978320	4979320	Huh?
4979320	4981320	Poison doesn't work on undead.
4981320	4983320	Well, the dagger does.
4983320	4984320	Yeah, that's what I was saying.
4984320	4985320	Yeah, definitely.
4985320	4987320	Cool.
4987320	4990320	So I sneak attack the guy.
4990320	4991320	Okay.
4991320	4993320	And just go to town.
4996320	4999320	Going to town on the guy with a sneak attack.
4999320	5003320	You strike directly between his shoulder blades.
5003320	5005320	Dealing.
5007320	5009320	Fifteen damage.
5012320	5017320	I give Christopher a little chit, did he call it?
5017320	5019320	Like from AA.
5019320	5024320	That's one day of not tying a rope around your dagger
5024320	5025320	when you throw it.
5025320	5026320	But you know what?
5026320	5028320	I thought about it a lot.
5028320	5029320	I can see.
5029320	5032320	It's been the toughest day of my life.
5032320	5034320	Did you call it a chit?
5034320	5038320	Yeah, you get those little chit with a P.
5038320	5040320	A chit is a thing too.
5040320	5041320	Is it?
5041320	5042320	Yeah.
5042320	5043320	I don't know.
5043320	5044320	Google it.
5044320	5045320	Yeah.
5045320	5046320	What?
5046320	5047320	It's in your butt.
5047320	5048320	I believe you guys.
5048320	5049320	Is it almost dead?
5049320	5050320	You don't know.
5050320	5051320	It is undead.
5051320	5054320	What is it doing right now?
5054320	5056320	It's being stabbed.
5056320	5058320	There's a knife in it.
5058320	5059320	Okay.
5059320	5061320	It's not like responding.
5061320	5062320	How is it reacting?
5062320	5063320	It's not.
5063320	5065320	It's not like a person that feels pain.
5065320	5066320	It's more like a skeleton.
5066320	5067320	You're not like a person.
5067320	5069320	It's all right.
5069320	5071320	You know, the skeletons are me.
5071320	5073320	We went over this.
5074320	5075320	That's a throwback.
5075320	5076320	Who's next?
5076320	5078320	That's Moraine's turn.
5078320	5080320	All right.
5080320	5084320	So I have no idea how the skeleton's reacting.
5084320	5089320	So I'm going to just grapple.
5089320	5092320	I'm going to grapple with the skeleton.
5092320	5094320	I'm going to make eye contact with him.
5094320	5097320	And I'll say, thank you for your sacrifice.
5097320	5101320	And I try to throw him off the bridge.
5101320	5102320	Okay.
5102320	5103320	Don't look at me, Dan.
5103320	5107320	I just want to know, like, what...
5107320	5109320	You wanted to know how the skeleton was reacting
5109320	5110320	before you did that?
5110320	5112320	Like, what would you have done?
5112320	5115320	Well, I mean, if Camille did that,
5115320	5117320	and he was like, all right, guys, come on.
5117320	5118320	Let's cool it.
5118320	5119320	Oh, okay.
5119320	5120320	You just wanted to make sure the monster wasn't...
5120320	5121320	Okay, all right.
5121320	5122320	All right.
5122320	5123320	So the monster did not stay...
5123320	5125320	Or if he was on the ground or if he was flying...
5125320	5128320	I mean, Spencer's much smarter and better than I am.
5128320	5131320	No, that makes sense now that he explained it, but yeah.
5131320	5132320	Yeah.
5132320	5135320	I also do a pink mask on it to make it gay in the Africa.
5140320	5141320	Does it...
5141320	5144320	Do they have to be dead for that?
5144320	5146320	No, I mean, for the pink mask.
5146320	5148320	In terms of Satanist ritualism.
5148320	5151320	I think you could do it to someone who's alive, right?
5151320	5154320	Well, I mean, couldn't they just be like, I'm going to be gay?
5154320	5155320	Yeah.
5155320	5158320	And then they wouldn't need this whole satanic ritual.
5158320	5159320	Who, the Satanist?
5159320	5160320	What are you talking about?
5160320	5161320	The pink mask.
5161320	5162320	What is a pink mask?
5162320	5165320	No, they said they were doing a sort of protest
5165320	5168320	on the grave of this lady making her gay in the afterlife.
5168320	5169320	Anyway.
5169320	5170320	It happened in the show earlier on.
5170320	5173320	That doesn't happen in Dungeons and Dragons.
5173320	5174320	It fails.
5176320	5178320	So he's still straight?
5178320	5179320	Yeah, still straight.
5180320	5181320	Fuck.
5182320	5184320	What happened with my grappling?
5184320	5185320	Yeah, okay.
5185320	5190320	So you managed to wrestle it and you're trying to flip it over, you know, off the edge.
5190320	5192320	But you just kind of...
5192320	5196320	You guys go down to the floor and you're just kind of grappling with each other wrestling style.
5197320	5198320	So I didn't...
5199320	5202320	She didn't have enough force to send it over the edge.
5202320	5203320	Okay.
5204320	5205320	But, you know, it's down.
5205320	5206320	It's there.
5206320	5207320	But it's on me.
5207320	5209320	You're on it also.
5210320	5211320	Definitely still straight.
5211320	5213320	It's a mutual kerfuffle.
5213320	5215320	Does he have a boner?
5216320	5217320	No.
5217320	5218320	That's just...
5218320	5219320	I know.
5219320	5220320	That was my joke that he was a skeleton.
5220320	5221320	Someone in the audience says he's a skeleton.
5221320	5222320	I'm sorry.
5222320	5223320	I apologize.
5223320	5224320	So I'm on him.
5224320	5225320	It's not working now.
5225320	5226320	He doesn't have a boner.
5226320	5227320	Okay.
5227320	5228320	Just to clarify.
5228320	5229320	To Sharpie?
5229320	5230320	To Sharpie?
5230320	5231320	Quark actually does have a boner.
5231320	5233320	He gets a battle boner sometimes.
5233320	5234320	Just to clarify.
5234320	5235320	I've got a battle boner.
5236320	5238320	Just like an anger boner?
5238320	5240320	Only when I'm in battle.
5240320	5242320	Or when you want to fuck a horse or whatever.
5243320	5244320	Oh yeah.
5246320	5247320	Saddle battle.
5248320	5249320	Putting it.
5249320	5250320	Saddle boner?
5250320	5251320	Saddle boner.
5251320	5252320	Alright.
5253320	5256320	I can't use shrink item on a skeleton.
5256320	5257320	That's only an item, right?
5257320	5258320	That's correct.
5258320	5259320	And I...
5259320	5261320	Do I have any shocking grasps left?
5261320	5262320	Yeah, yeah.
5262320	5264320	On your trek you gain back all your spells
5264320	5266320	and you've only used one of them.
5266320	5267320	Alright.
5267320	5268320	But isn't that also...
5268320	5269320	If he's grappling with her,
5269320	5271320	isn't that gonna shock both of them?
5272320	5273320	Who knows?
5274320	5276320	You gotta do it!
5277320	5278320	Let's see what happens.
5279320	5280320	It's magic.
5280320	5281320	Alright.
5281320	5284320	I initiate my shocking grasp
5284320	5289320	and then I say something involving bones.
5289320	5290320	Some kind of pun.
5291320	5292320	A butt-pun?
5292320	5293320	You're a bone.
5293320	5294320	Bone out.
5294320	5295320	Bone to know you.
5295320	5296320	Bone to know you.
5297320	5298320	Bone Vayash.
5299320	5300320	Adam Goldberg.
5300320	5301320	Adam Goldberg.
5301320	5302320	Adam Goldberg.
5302320	5303320	Take a bow.
5303320	5304320	Stand up.
5305320	5306320	Adam Goldberg.
5308320	5309320	Bone Vayash.
5309320	5310320	That's fantastic.
5310320	5311320	We could've been here all night
5311320	5312320	and not tapped Bone Vayash.
5312320	5313320	No.
5313320	5314320	You would not beat that.
5314320	5317320	I was like, hey, mandible shit.
5317320	5320320	Yeah, Dan's was bone to know you.
5321320	5323320	This has never been my wheelhouse puns,
5323320	5326320	but Bone Vayash is...
5326320	5329320	Yeah, I do it with an Austrian accent,
5329320	5332320	you know, Bone Vayash and...
5333320	5336320	Grasping him with a shocking energy.
5336320	5339320	Electricity crackles through his bony body
5339320	5343320	and you hear a sizzling from deep within his chest
5343320	5346320	and then he catches fire and falls to the floor.
5346320	5347320	Inert.
5349320	5351320	Looks like he...
5351320	5354320	Skeleton...
5356320	5358320	Oh, fell apart.
5359320	5361320	You can't improvise a pun, can you?
5361320	5363320	He fell like a skeleton of bricks.
5363320	5364320	You can't.
5364320	5365320	You can't.
5366320	5367320	I win.
5368320	5369320	I count it.
5369320	5370320	I count it.
5370320	5372320	I get 500 experience points.
5373320	5374320	He gave himself...
5374320	5377320	I'm having my own podcast over here.
5378320	5379320	It's high time.
5379320	5380320	Well, we did it.
5380320	5381320	So we did it.
5381320	5382320	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5382320	5384320	I forge on towards the far side of the bridge.
5384320	5388320	You forge on towards the far side of the bridge.
5388320	5393320	You see the gates of Fornheim standing tall and imperious.
5395320	5398320	They slowly grind open and you can hear a voice from within
5398320	5400320	echo out like a trumpet.
5400320	5405320	Welcome to Fornheim, the fortress of the mighty,
5405320	5407320	the land of the strong.
5407320	5410320	I call back, weirdest welcome ever.
5412320	5413320	There's no response.
5413320	5416320	Huge waste of energy and manpower.
5418320	5423320	That would be funny if every time we drove into Indiana, you'd hear...
5423320	5425320	Welcome to Indiana.
5425320	5426320	The sunshine.
5426320	5427320	This is it.
5427320	5430320	But also, like, if there was a locked gate that only opened
5430320	5432320	after you fought four skeletons.
5433320	5435320	I mean, just lock the gate harder.
5435320	5437320	Make signals here, guys.
5437320	5439320	Make it clearer that we're not welcome.
5441320	5442320	Metagaming?
5442320	5443320	Uh, I mean...
5444320	5445320	No, mate.
5446320	5447320	Well, we go in.
5447320	5449320	Yeah, good call.
5449320	5450320	Good call.
5450320	5454320	Yeah, you enter the walls of Fornheim and you see stuff.
5455320	5458320	Uh, I look around to see where they're sitting.
5458320	5459320	Yeah.
5459320	5460320	Sorry.
5461320	5462320	I'll go.
5462320	5465320	As you enter the massive gates, you're met with an awesome site.
5465320	5470320	The massive city within the massive walls is full of massively oversized buildings.
5470320	5474320	With paths as wide as ponds and houses as big as castles,
5474320	5476320	as well as towering giants.
5476320	5480320	These blue-skinned beings, with coarse, pale blonde and icy hair,
5480320	5485320	stand about 15 to 20 feet tall, clanking around in heavy metal armor,
5485320	5488320	talking, conducting in business, and are shooting the breeze.
5489320	5490320	Literally.
5490320	5491320	Yeah, boy.
5491320	5495320	In sharp contrast to the massive blue figures and icy white walls,
5495320	5497320	you can make out specks dot around the city.
5497320	5501320	Black blobs that you recognize as more of those skeletons you fought earlier.
5501320	5503320	They're marching and patrolling the streets,
5503320	5506320	as well as manning the gates and guarding the walls.
5507320	5509320	I thought this was like a dwarf town.
5511320	5512320	I got confused.
5512320	5513320	Yeah.
5513320	5516320	Maybe we should have done a little more reconnaissance before we came into this place.
5516320	5517320	That's something you can do.
5517320	5520320	Maybe we should get on top of each other's shoulders.
5520320	5522320	And put on a giant trench coat.
5522320	5523320	Yeah.
5523320	5526320	And hold our breath till we're blue in the face.
5527320	5529320	Uh, so why are we in this town? I'm sorry.
5529320	5530320	Because the guy went, welcome.
5530320	5531320	And we said, let's go.
5531320	5532320	And now we're in here.
5532320	5533320	No, no, no.
5533320	5534320	Before that.
5534320	5535320	Yeah, before that.
5535320	5536320	Oh, we're looking for Admiral Darkstar.
5536320	5537320	Okay.
5537320	5538320	Yeah, he's to the north.
5538320	5539320	And this is on your way to the north.
5539320	5540320	He's a bad guy.
5540320	5542320	Well, we were talking about raising an army here.
5542320	5543320	Right.
5543320	5545320	That should be no sweat.
5545320	5547320	We just killed a couple of their homies out front, didn't we?
5547320	5550320	But it seems like that's how you open the door.
5550320	5551320	Yeah.
5551320	5552320	Maybe, yeah.
5552320	5553320	Those are just mental.
5553320	5555320	Who's the biggest and baddest here?
5555320	5558320	Like, let's walk in there and talk a big game and say,
5558320	5561320	look, we're not here to fuck around.
5561320	5564320	We're here to get an army together and go kill Admiral Darkstar.
5564320	5568320	I mean, in a different way, I could use my diplomacy.
5568320	5570320	Try to talk to them.
5570320	5571320	Okay.
5571320	5573320	But who do we talk to?
5573320	5574320	Can we walk?
5574320	5577320	I look for the sweetest-faced giant.
5577320	5578320	Okay.
5578320	5583320	Well, some guy who's clearly, like, nicer than me.
5583320	5586320	It's like giving water to the smaller giants.
5586320	5588320	I'm just laughing.
5588320	5589320	Someone drops a hat.
5589320	5590320	He gives them their hat.
5591320	5592320	Scanning the city.
5592320	5597320	You see what you make out to be the most jovial of the giants.
5597320	5601320	But not at anyone else's expense.
5601320	5603320	He's not laughing because he's picking on them.
5603320	5604320	That's not what I'm explaining.
5604320	5605320	Right, right, right.
5605320	5606320	Okay.
5606320	5607320	Just making sure.
5607320	5609320	I mean, that's fine.
5609320	5610320	You see him.
5610320	5612320	He looks jovial.
5612320	5613320	Okay.
5613320	5615320	Do you guys mind if I approach?
5615320	5616320	Knock yourself out.
5616320	5617320	Yeah.
5617320	5618320	We'll be back here.
5618320	5619320	Okay.
5619320	5622320	No, I go with her because we still have our little buddy pack.
5622320	5623320	Yes, thank you.
5623320	5627320	I go with her because I wouldn't miss this for the world.
5627320	5632320	I put on a shirt that says team giant on it and I walked down.
5632320	5640320	Aaron talking to a non-player character is like every time the smoking man showed up in X-Files.
5640320	5643320	I am riveted.
5645320	5648320	Yeah, so you and Quark are kind of walking up.
5648320	5649320	We'll all go.
5649320	5650320	Okay.
5650320	5651320	You're all walking up.
5651320	5652320	All right.
5652320	5654320	Hello, sir.
5654320	5656320	Looks like you're closer to heaven.
5661320	5664320	How does the joke land?
5664320	5671320	The giant looks as if perhaps he was bit by a mosquito, sort of like a...
5671320	5673320	And this is the happiest guy.
5673320	5674320	Yeah, yeah.
5674320	5681320	And then he kind of looks around and then he looks down at you and then he points at
5681320	5684320	you and he's like...
5684320	5685320	It landed.
5685320	5686320	It landed.
5686320	5687320	Yeah, I think it landed.
5687320	5688320	You get a chuckle.
5688320	5689320	Hey, good one.
5689320	5694320	Boy, since I was a young girl, I've dreamt of being in a town like this.
5694320	5699320	What is it like to be the most fantastic looking...
5699320	5702320	Okay, guys, what do we do?
5702320	5703320	You're doing great.
5703320	5704320	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5704320	5706320	First a fantastic looking thing.
5706320	5709320	You got to write where you want them.
5709320	5715320	Sir, what is it like to be the most fantastic looking and...
5715320	5721320	You emanate this joy and me and my friends were very nice, peaceful people and we just
5721320	5725320	wanted to know what was happening here and I've been talking for too long and this is
5725320	5730320	what I do and I drop my papers like in a romantic comedy and I hope that he's going to pick
5730320	5732320	them up because I'm like...
5732320	5735320	I'm Meg Ryan and I'm just so blustered.
5735320	5738320	Oh, I'm such a clumsy bitch.
5738320	5748320	Does he help her with the papers?
5748320	5757320	No, his hands are probably too big to pick him up but he doesn't help with the papers.
5757320	5762320	Sir Giant, we are travelers from the south heading north and...
5762320	5768320	Whoa, but did we stop here, Mr. Happy?
5768320	5774320	I'm Robin Williams.
5774320	5779320	We are in pursuit of a threat that threatens all of...
5779320	5781320	What's this planet called?
5781320	5782320	Earth?
5782320	5787320	Earth.
5787320	5795320	I am kind of standing behind all of them and just instinctively grab the handle of my sword.
5795320	5800320	I should tell them that I'm like a very well-known singer-songwriter.
5800320	5804320	I move my hands like I'm about to take off my tiny little clothes.
5804320	5812320	We request an audience with your leader if you have one or the commission that leads you.
5812320	5814320	But you're probably the leader, right?
5814320	5816320	I mean, he looks like the leader.
5816320	5819320	Either that or a model.
5819320	5826320	He kind of just looks at you guys all saying and doing these things that you're describing, saying and doing.
5826320	5827320	Can he not hear us?
5827320	5828320	No, he is.
5828320	5831320	He's exactly hearing you right now and I'm describing that.
5831320	5833320	And he is hearing...
5833320	5837320	He's like, yeah, but he's listening and he's looking at you guys, do stuff.
5837320	5842320	And then he's like, so you're looking for the yarl.
5842320	5843320	Yeah.
5843320	5845320	We're looking for the yarl.
5845320	5848320	I don't even know why we forgot the word for it.
5848320	5849320	That's exactly right.
5849320	5852320	We should have said that when we first showed up.
5852320	5857320	Well, it ain't just anyone that can see the yarl.
5858320	5859320	Okay.
5859320	5860320	Yeah.
5860320	5861320	Who can see the yarl?
5861320	5863320	Only the strong.
5863320	5866320	Did you hear that thing that was said when you entered the city?
5866320	5872320	No, we were busy mocking it.
5872320	5873320	We are strong.
5873320	5875320	We slayed a couple of...
5875320	5878320	Tell them that.
5878320	5879320	No!
5879320	5882320	Dire wolves.
5882320	5885320	Good save, bro.
5886320	5891320	Yeah, yes, I've plucked many a dire wolf from my garden.
5891320	5894320	I don't think he knows what that word means.
5894320	5896320	He grows wolves.
5896320	5898320	This guy rocks.
5898320	5901320	Can we just hang out with him for a while?
5901320	5906320	Well, if there was a way that we could prove our strengths other than getting in your...
5906320	5913320	Not to put too fine a point on it, but less than a hospitable threshold.
5913320	5916320	Tough, tough, ice city.
5916320	5922320	We would love to prove our strengths and or just have our strengths taken as a flyer
5922320	5927320	and get an audience with aforementioned yarl.
5927320	5933320	Also, if you giants enjoy a show by tiny people, maybe the four of us could put on a small show.
5933320	5934320	It's true.
5934320	5936320	We are singer-songwriters.
5936320	5940320	I recently got into doing some sketch comedy stuff.
5940320	5944320	I've heard enough of this, says the barbarian.
5944320	5947320	I'm as tough as any man here.
5947320	5950320	Giant or no.
5953320	5954320	Then prove it.
5954320	5956320	Show me the way.
5956320	5957320	Punch me, punch me.
5957320	5962320	Okay, I go up to a quirk and I go,
5962320	5966320	Hey, insolent person.
5966320	5968320	And I'm winking at him.
5968320	5970320	We're going to do like a Star Trek movie.
5970320	5973320	Hey, shut your mouth, you little fucker.
5973320	5976320	I'm one of 12 different planets.
5976320	5978320	You're not so tough.
5978320	5979320	You're not so tough.
5979320	5981320	And I get in there and I say, no, lay off him.
5981320	5984320	I drop my papers again.
5986320	5988320	Stop that.
5988320	5990320	I can't help it.
5990320	5993320	I take Sharpie and I give him a little wink, which is really good.
5993320	5994320	I return the wink.
5994320	5997320	And I pick him up over my head and start spinning him around.
5997320	6000320	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
6000320	6003320	This guy's a real tough customer.
6003320	6009320	And I find the biggest, the biggest, busiest ice road.
6009320	6012320	And I throw him down like I got a Roadhouse bar top.
6012320	6014320	Like I just slide him down.
6014320	6017320	But I'm so much bigger than you.
6019320	6020320	Bonk.
6020320	6025320	In the chaos, I go off in the corner and I tie a rope to a knife.
6028320	6029320	Be prepared.
6029320	6031320	Always be prepared.
6031320	6032320	Okay.
6032320	6033320	Yeah.
6033320	6041320	You attempt this display of mock violence and it's really pitiful.
6041320	6043320	It's not working.
6043320	6045320	It's not working.
6045320	6051320	And then he throws you and you go skidding down this ice road.
6051320	6055320	And then he's like, that's pretty tough.
6056320	6057320	Wait, when I throw Sharpie?
6057320	6058320	Yeah.
6058320	6059320	Oh, he likes that.
6059320	6061320	As pitiful as it was, it seemed to have impressed him.
6061320	6063320	So now we go to see the arm?
6063320	6067320	He's like, yeah, you know, I mean, if you guys are really that tough,
6067320	6071320	but you might have to pull that shit again in front of some other giants.
6071320	6075320	Oh, I got, I got, I got, I got bits.
6075320	6079320	I think, I think, I think we just accidentally blew the roadie.
6079320	6084320	Classic, classic mistake.
6084320	6085320	Classic.
6085320	6088320	And a real amateur move.
6088320	6091320	Pink Floyd's in the green room.
6091320	6093320	Lead the way, sir.
6093320	6095320	He's like, I don't lead.
6095320	6097320	Follow the silent servants.
6097320	6102320	He kind of points at a line of skeletons that are kind of patrolling through the city.
6102320	6106320	They're led by one of these skeletons is just ablaze on fire.
6106320	6108320	He's just lit on fire.
6108320	6109320	I say, thank you, sir.
6109320	6114320	You are truly the most joyous creature that we have encountered in a long time.
6114320	6116320	So does a skeleton on fire?
6116320	6119320	Yeah, it's kind of walking around through the city, melting ice and snow,
6119320	6122320	and there's a column of steam kind of rising off it.
6122320	6123320	Cool.
6123320	6125320	But they're just walking in a line.
6125320	6127320	All right, well, we should follow that.
6127320	6128320	Yep.
6128320	6129320	Yeah.
6129320	6130320	Okay.
6130320	6131320	Do you still have your giants t-shirt on?
6131320	6135320	Yeah, I have team giants and I've added a blazing skeleton also.
6136320	6139320	And on the back it says, my favorite movie is Ghost Rider.
6142320	6146320	I start whistling the theme from Bridge Over the River Kwai.
6150320	6152320	Wait, you sing when you whistle?
6152320	6154320	Well, I don't know how to whistle.
6154320	6156320	I can't whistle either.
6156320	6157320	High five, bro.
6157320	6158320	Yeah.
6158320	6160320	So few people don't know how to whistle.
6160320	6162320	Anyone can whistle.
6162320	6163320	No.
6164320	6166320	But that's a different story.
6166320	6169320	So we're following these silent leaders, silent whatever.
6169320	6171320	Yeah, yeah, the silent servants.
6171320	6173320	They're just kind of...
6173320	6176320	You really can't control this, this group.
6177320	6179320	I can't really whistle.
6186320	6188320	That was a great try, Dan.
6189320	6191320	Hey, it's us or hang out with your dad.
6191320	6192320	You pick.
6198320	6201320	I walk up to one of the silent servants and say,
6201320	6204320	Excuse me, gentlemen, we're looking for Yarl.
6204320	6205320	You be so kind.
6205320	6207320	You saw what I did to my friend over here.
6207320	6210320	I threw him a good 50 meters down the ice road.
6210320	6211320	See.
6211320	6213320	Make it snappy and show us the way.
6213320	6215320	No, no, don't be aggressive.
6215320	6217320	They respond to might here, Chris.
6217320	6222320	The head kind of turns towards you and its eyes kind of like glow with a blue flame
6222320	6224320	and you can hear a voice out of its chest.
6224320	6226320	It's teeny and mechanical sounding.
6226320	6227320	It says,
6227320	6230320	Don't bother the silent servants.
6230320	6232320	I was just told to come over to you.
6232320	6233320	Well, they're walking.
6233320	6234320	We just follow.
6234320	6235320	We follow.
6235320	6236320	Okay, we're following.
6236320	6237320	Yeah, yeah.
6237320	6238320	Sorry.
6238320	6239320	That's happening.
6239320	6240320	All right.
6240320	6241320	I was just trying to be tough.
6241320	6244320	I want to get one of those chest plate things for me so that when I fart...
6245320	6247320	It wasn't this person.
6249320	6251320	So people think your chest farted?
6251320	6254320	It's like blaming it on the dog, you know, you fart and then...
6254320	6257320	Oh, so it was me, the chest plate.
6257320	6261320	I thought when you fart, it just emits a louder mechanical fart to hide.
6261320	6262320	I didn't think it through.
6262320	6263320	I just...
6263320	6266320	The dots I was connecting were in this order.
6266320	6267320	Silent but deadly.
6267320	6268320	Silent.
6268320	6269320	Silent servants.
6269320	6270320	Silent servants.
6270320	6271320	I kind of...
6271320	6273320	And then from there I was off-roading.
6273320	6277320	I was relying on the statistical chance of me being funny when I talked.
6278320	6281320	And I blew it, as I do seven out of ten times.
6283320	6284320	So we're following.
6284320	6286320	There's a lot of math to it.
6286320	6287320	Oh, yeah.
6287320	6290320	Dan, have you been blaming it on the dog?
6290320	6291320	We have a dog.
6291320	6292320	And it farts a lot.
6292320	6293320	Yeah.
6293320	6296320	And I have ramped up my farting.
6296320	6297320	It's true.
6297320	6299320	You have.
6300320	6306320	When Dan was getting his endoscopy, there was a page in the big stack of papers that
6306320	6308320	he had to sign that said...
6309320	6314320	When the camera goes down, it pushes a lot of air through you, so you make sure you release
6314320	6315320	the air.
6316320	6317320	Pre-fart.
6317320	6318320	Yeah.
6318320	6320320	It was giving you permission to fart, like, thing.
6320320	6322320	This isn't either the time or the place.
6322320	6325320	All right, so we're following the silent servant.
6325320	6326320	Yeah, yeah.
6326320	6330320	They take you around through the city, and you're kind of going by these little snowed-in,
6330320	6334320	little, like, huts that are weird because, you know, this is a giant city, and these
6334320	6335320	huts wouldn't fit them.
6335320	6336320	Anyway...
6336320	6337320	But the skeletons are normal size, right?
6337320	6338320	That's true.
6338320	6339320	Do they have doors?
6340320	6344320	You can't tell because they're just covered in snow past the door, like, up to their
6344320	6345320	little roofs.
6346320	6347320	Come on.
6347320	6348320	I stop at one.
6348320	6349320	Come on.
6349320	6350320	Okay.
6351320	6352320	I brush some snow away.
6352320	6353320	I'm looking for a little door.
6354320	6355320	It has a little door.
6355320	6358320	I'm going to knock on the door with my Gandalf staff.
6360320	6362320	There's no response.
6362320	6364320	I'll be back later.
6365320	6366320	Continuing on.
6366320	6367320	You go...
6368320	6370320	And you got balls, man.
6370320	6373320	You know, that was a great, like, what is it called?
6373320	6374320	Dingin' Ditch?
6374320	6375320	What's it called?
6375320	6376320	Yeah, Dingin' Ditch.
6376320	6377320	Yeah.
6377320	6378320	Dingin' Ditch.
6378320	6380320	We didn't do that in Pakistan.
6380320	6381320	There's no dong.
6381320	6382320	Dingin' Ditch.
6382320	6383320	No.
6383320	6384320	It's a Dingin' Ditch.
6384320	6385320	Dingin' Ditch.
6385320	6386320	Run away.
6387320	6389320	You have to be in an actual ditch.
6389320	6392320	Do your doorbells sound different in Pakistan?
6393320	6394320	I...
6394320	6395320	We...
6395320	6396320	I don't know.
6396320	6397320	No?
6397320	6398320	The same?
6398320	6399320	Oh, okay.
6399320	6400320	Yeah.
6400320	6401320	I was just wondering.
6401320	6402320	Yeah, they're not like...
6402320	6403320	Because the animals.
6403320	6404320	They're not like...
6405320	6406320	No.
6406320	6410320	I mean, sirens sound different in every country.
6410320	6412320	They just said Death to America when I...
6413320	6414320	Death to America?
6414320	6415320	Death to America?
6415320	6416320	I guess they're not home.
6416320	6417320	Oh, it's some of these ears.
6417320	6418320	All right.
6418320	6419320	So we're following?
6419320	6420320	Yeah, yeah.
6420320	6425880	You go up a massive icy staircase and into a large kind of castle within the city made
6425880	6427400	out of ice.
6427400	6430820	It's all ice.
6430820	6435320	You arrive in a massive room with a ceiling hundreds of feet tall.
6435320	6436320	Well, hi.
6436320	6437320	Whatever.
6437320	6438320	Hello.
6438320	6443440	Old statues line the room and standing in the center of the statues is a massive blue
6443440	6446200	giant easily 30 feet tall.
6446200	6453120	He wears a great magenta breastplate and wears a huge brown fur cloak off some oversized
6453120	6454120	beast.
6454120	6456840	His booming voice echoes through the icy chamber.
6456840	6461600	I am Lim Dahl, the Yarl of Fordheim.
6461600	6464400	Bow to my might.
6464400	6469400	Pretending to have met him previously, I scream out, so nice to see you again.
6469400	6471400	Bow to his fucking might.
6471400	6474040	Maybe he'll think that we know each other.
6474040	6476400	I bow to his might for sure.
6476400	6480400	I say this as I am bowing to his might.
6480400	6481400	Okay.
6481400	6483400	We definitely blew the roadie.
6483400	6486400	I bow to his might.
6486400	6487400	Okay.
6487400	6490400	I reluctantly bow.
6490400	6492400	Thank you.
6492400	6495040	Great bow to.
6495040	6498120	And for that, I thank you.
6498120	6501440	Gratitude received.
6501440	6503440	What brings you to Fordheim?
6503440	6504440	We're looking for some-
6504440	6505440	The frozen city.
6505440	6506440	Yeah, that's great.
6506440	6512400	It's like an OCD thing, but he has to say the entire thing.
6512400	6517960	It's on their license plate frame.
6517960	6520960	We're looking for some Yarls.
6520960	6521960	Yellers.
6521960	6522960	Yackars.
6522960	6523960	What are they?
6523960	6524960	Yellers?
6524960	6525960	Yarl.
6525960	6526960	He's the Yarl.
6526960	6527960	Yarl is the king.
6527960	6528960	Yarl means king.
6528960	6529960	Yarl means king.
6529960	6532480	As I'm falling to my knees, I say, I'll never fall in love.
6532480	6533480	My career's too important.
6533480	6539200	She keeps dropping papers.
6539200	6540200	What's on these?
6540200	6541200	I pick up the papers.
6541200	6542200	What the fuck is on these things?
6542200	6543200	No.
6543200	6544440	I read your papers.
6544440	6549040	It just says, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
6549040	6551320	Over and over.
6551320	6552320	You were terrified.
6552320	6555040	I didn't really realize he was a Yarl.
6555040	6558200	Oh, Yarl of Farnheim.
6558200	6559200	Frozen city.
6559200	6560200	Yarl?
6560200	6561200	Yarl.
6561200	6562200	I know.
6562200	6564200	I'm sorry.
6564200	6569680	Gateway to the mountains.
6569680	6572520	A great city by a great lake.
6572520	6576920	The blue diamond of the north.
6576920	6577920	Old snowy.
6577920	6589240	It is our grand pleasure, a pleasure only, exceeded in size only by your stature and
6589240	6598480	might that we arrive here in your slippery, sticky halls in a good way, in a good way.
6598480	6603320	I am overcome by your power and I fall down.
6603320	6606160	I drop one paper.
6606160	6611520	One would no more dare to offend thee than one would dare to stick one's tongue on a
6611520	6612520	common surface.
6612520	6617320	Have you seen Christmas story?
6617320	6622040	I take out my sword and- No, bro.
6622040	6626360	And I wake up and go, pardon me, but can I cleave my way through all the bullshit?
6626360	6627360	Whoa.
6627360	6628360	Oh boy.
6628360	6629360	Fonzie's in town.
6629360	6635360	And I put my sword back away with him.
6635360	6636360	He puts it away.
6636360	6637360	Oh yeah.
6637360	6638360	I took it away.
6638360	6639360	Oh, okay.
6639360	6640360	Well, I mean- I'm not gonna walk around with it.
6640360	6641360	You just took it out?
6641360	6642360	I took it out too.
6642360	6643360	You're just trying to cut the rectangle.
6643360	6644360	I was making a point.
6644360	6645360	He regards your social maneuver.
6645360	6646360	Great.
6646360	6647360	Listen.
6647360	6648360	Limdol, was it?
6648360	6649360	Limdol.
6649360	6650360	My name is Cork.
6650360	6651360	Pfft.
6651360	6652360	Well met.
6652360	6658360	My friends and I are, after a certain Admiral Darkstar, are you familiar with this gentleman?
6658360	6661200	Oh, I'm familiar with this gentleman.
6661200	6667760	It's your take.
6667760	6669360	I'm not a fond of him.
6669360	6670360	Yeah, yeah.
6670360	6671360	Neither of us will.
6671360	6672680	No, he's the worst.
6672680	6674960	You saw the air quotes around gentlemen, right?
6674960	6675960	Yeah.
6675960	6676960	Right.
6676960	6681920	Well, we have one mission and one mission alone and it's to take him down.
6681920	6685560	We could certainly use a little assistance because, as you see, we're just four tiny
6685560	6687400	little fuckers.
6687400	6690360	You could use some assistance- I just said that.
6690360	6692720	But you have something I could use.
6692720	6693720	Oh, okay.
6693720	6694720	Great.
6694720	6695720	This is going to be great.
6695720	6698600	What's the expression on his face right now, Spencer?
6698600	6700160	It's holding all the cards.
6700160	6701800	It's that expression.
6701800	6702800	All right.
6702800	6704560	Fair enough.
6704560	6706360	What is it you want from us?
6706360	6710800	Oh, just a few of your fragments of power.
6710800	6713480	Oh, boy.
6713480	6715480	Can we have a sidebar?
6715480	6719720	Gentlemen, do you think he's talking about my business papers?
6720680	6722840	I think we should definitely try.
6722840	6723840	There was no business.
6723840	6726040	One page, it was just a bunch of drawings of Dixon Bowles.
6726040	6732440	Look, I'm going to be a magazine editor, executive, business merger lady some day and I've got
6732440	6734920	to take all my ladies- okay, stop it.
6734920	6735920	Okay.
6735920	6736920	You have shards of power, right?
6736920	6739560	Are those like the amulet of autumn and stuff?
6739560	6743520	No, these are stuff that you've collected sharpie hats.
6743520	6749160	Guys, the shards of power, if- Admiral Darkstar wants all of those, I feel like- what if this
6749160	6752080	guy's just lying to us and works for him, he's going to hand them all over to him.
6752080	6753080	Yeah.
6753080	6756320	Should we ask him if there's something else that he would want instead?
6756320	6759760	What do we get in return for these shards, like exactly?
6759760	6766080	I will give you some of my finest horses as well as a regiment of six frost giant warriors
6766080	6767280	to aid you.
6767280	6768280	For how many shards?
6768280	6769280	For how many shards?
6769280	6770280	Horses.
6770280	6771280	I want all of them.
6771280	6773280	You want all of our shards?
6773280	6776240	All right, sorry, I've had a tough day.
6776880	6780800	Sorry, is there something else that you would take instead of shards?
6780800	6786160	Most of the shards.
6786160	6790120	I have goggles of night, do you want that?
6790120	6791840	You take that instead of the shards?
6791840	6792840	No.
6792840	6799160	Can somebody who's got more wisdom than me sense motive on this guy?
6799160	6801200	You fail to sense his motive.
6801200	6803360	I asked somebody else to do it.
6803360	6805320	Somebody else also fails.
6805320	6808960	All right, I think we got to get my own dice.
6808960	6814600	We got to put a bookmark here because we're in the hall of the frost giant.
6814600	6816600	All right, Yarl the cliffhanger.
6816600	6817600	Yarl the cliffhanger.
6817600	6819600	All right, thank you Kumail Nanjiani.
6819600	6821600	Thank you, Aaron McGathey.
6821600	6829000	Thank you, Spencer, for your dungeon mastery.
6829000	6838080	Please, on Saturday, come to the silent movie theater, Google it, Harmon Quest it's called,
6838080	6842640	in cooperation with Cine Family, come to the thing, the thing I'm about to talk about.
6842640	6843640	It's show time.
6843640	6844640	We're done, baby.
6844640	6847760	You want to say a nice little lesson learned?
6847760	6848760	What have we learned?
6848760	6851200	Gay people should be allowed to be gay.
6851200	6856960	If you fuck around with that, Satanists will turn your dead grandma's gay.
6856960	6859920	Some Black Panthers are Irish.
6859920	6867760	Black Panthers should not be exiled to Tanzania because that guy could have been doing a lot
6867760	6868760	of good here.
6868760	6873000	Instead, he's got an orphanage over there.
6873000	6877640	It's possible to have a thing called jeep butt.
6877640	6884720	All together, a wonderful ... Oh, and San Diego can go fuck itself like, yes, I'm in.
6884720	6887760	I'm in downtown mostly, but mostly what I think I've learned is that we love you as
6887760	6888760	always.
6888760	6889760	Thank you for coming to Harmon Town.
6889760	6890760	Have a good night.
6890760	6891760	Watch out.
6891760	6892760	We're on music.
6892760	6893760	We're on music.
6893760	6894760	We're on music.
6894760	6895760	Keep clapping.
6895760	6896760	There we are.
6896760	6897760	Oh, my God.
6897760	6905760	Thank you so much, Anatoly and Auntie, Adam Goldberg for Bone Viage.
6905760	6911480	That's what we should have said, which Dan ... Dan, we should have just ended with Bone
6911480	6912480	Viage.
6912480	6913480	Bone Viage.
6913480	6914480	Bone Viage.
