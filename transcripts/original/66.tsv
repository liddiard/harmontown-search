0	21440	Hello, one and all, welcome to Meltdown Comics and the world-famous Dirtmelt theater, Harmon
21440	30720	town is once again in session. Oh yeah. Won't you welcome to the stage the mayor of
30720	46920	Harmon town, Ted Harmon. Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, I'm Harmon town. Yo. Thank you Jeff Davis,
46920	54760	our comptroller. Hello. What a fantastic person. And what a good group of people you are. And
54760	60920	what a great country this is. God looking down and it's smiling and hoping it keeps moving forward.
62440	65960	I don't have anything to talk about tonight. I thought maybe I could stretch that into something.
67080	71880	Jingoism would be like taffy. I could stretch it to a finish line, but I don't have that much.
71880	80360	You got anything Jeff? You got any burrs in your boots? I almost didn't make this show. I took a
80360	84280	nap on my couch because we had brunch today that went straight to the drawing room and we just
84280	88840	drank all day long. And I took a nap and just like woke up and it was like 7 15. I'm like,
88840	100200	jeez Louise. I had to take a little nap today too. Because we did brunch. This is my life. We did
100200	106840	brunch and then I really did it too. And then during brunch, you know, it's like, let's go get
106840	113240	a drink. God, I'm so dehydrated right now. I'm just like, my eyes are red. I'm puffy. But I got
113240	118680	a dog now, which is, I think it's probably saving my life because I got to go home every couple
118680	124760	hours just to make sure the dog kind of, but sometimes the dog is laying there in its crate
124760	129320	and then I'll come home and go like, come on. I need to run you around the yard and the dog will
129400	135720	be like, uh, what's happening? And I'll wake it up specifically and then trotted around the yard and
135720	140040	it'll just start getting energized and I'll put it back in the crate. There was a moment today.
141240	145480	Feels bad. Because we went, we went and had brunch and Dan had pancakes and even shouted out
145480	150040	the word pancakes after having eaten them. Like you let go. Yeah, because it was like shrapnel,
150040	155960	like medic pancakes. And then we, so we had a bunch of beers and fornettes at that little
155960	160360	Dom's and then we went down to the drawing room and I overheard Dan saying like, I could get an
160360	164840	Uber car, which is like, you know, like, like a kind of a car service. And he was talking about
164840	171880	getting an Uber car from the drawing room to his house, which is seven blocks, seven blocks. And
171880	176600	just so you could go walk your dog. And such is our level of trust and friendship that I let you
176600	183560	drive my car drunk. I gave you my car. When you say drive my car drunk, it puts a really fine point
183640	191320	on it. I start picturing that on the TMZs and the Aussie yellows and the whatevers. Okay. Well,
191320	197080	we'll edit that out then. I drove Jeff's car drunk. I drove, I drove it up a tree and,
198440	204200	and there was a gypsy in and I ran her over and I take that NBC.
204360	211320	Um, but I, uh, I, I napped during a Prometheus. I pressed play on Prometheus,
212840	216120	which I had already seen in the theater and I just fell asleep listening to it. And I just
216120	222600	had these like, like, like shitty prequel dreams, like, like just dreams about like,
222600	226440	like people walking around going one day there's going to be a dream here.
226440	235480	But, but I got nothing. Let's, let's do, let's do a little experiment because I got nothing.
235480	241160	Let's, let's follow the, I got nothing thread and, and, uh, um, let's, uh,
242040	244520	let's bring up our friends. Let's bring up Kumail Nanjiani.
244520	261800	It's a nice summer, summer evening. It is a nice summer evening. And, and I got nothing.
263800	268760	Sit on the porch with me, won't you Kumail? And, and, and, and, and have a, have a nice tall glass
268760	275880	of, uh, country time living. Just rock back and forth in your chair and look out in a starlet
275880	284360	field and worry about minorities moving in. I'm sorry, you don't know this. That's what you do on
284360	291320	a porch. You're not familiar with this tradition. They're racist? The porches are racist? You can't
291320	297160	be, you can't have a porch and not be racist. I feel like I felt that vibe when I walk onto
297160	301080	a porch. I just kind of want to be like, you know, that's what porches are for. They're, they're,
301080	307880	they're racial, uh, uh, outposts. Yeah. I'm like, ah, some of these people could work harder.
307880	314040	Yeah. Just sort of sit out there and like, just watch the people walk by and go
314040	318200	and, and, and give them a, give them a subtle look. Like don't, you don't, don't buy a place,
318200	323400	uh, around here. Yeah. I could see you with one of those kind of like, like plantation,
323400	328600	like big, you know, colonial columns out front and really like a seersucker suit and a straw hat
328600	337400	and drinking like some like lemonade and just being racist. Thanks, Jeff. Why is it so much fun
337400	344280	to be racist? It simplifies life. It's, you know, the same reason it's fun to be into astrology.
344280	349560	There's 12 kinds of people. Oh yeah. Uh, I think there's 13 now. Didn't they find a new, uh,
349640	354440	planet or something? Yeah. And then they found out that everything we knew was wrong. So
354440	359480	tourists are actually Leo. Yeah. And then we kind of read them and we were like, let's ignore this.
359480	363960	This is weird. All these people are like, you told me if I was a Capricorn, I should expect
363960	369880	to find romance in the workplace. Yeah. That wasn't right. I married a guy in the copy room.
369880	377000	Yeah. Not a guy from the copy room. I married him in the copy room. I printed out the invitations
377000	383720	in that room, but there is liberation too. I mean, primates have these dopamine things in their
383720	390600	head. Like we look for patterns. It's way simpler. That's why I would like, um, okay, this is going
390600	398920	to get weird. Let's do it. I think for like at one point I was very, very religious and it was
398920	404440	actually kind of easier just to be like, Oh, something, some order, order. Yeah. This was all
404440	409480	of this makes sense rather than, Oh, this person got hit by a car for no reason. Even, even before
409480	416040	monotheism, even before we started to really order things, even the people that we call pagans, the
416040	421800	people that we call prehistoric, they, they still had order or otherwise we wouldn't even know they
421800	427800	existed because they were, they, they, unlike the, the chimps and whatever that came before them, they,
428520	436200	they, they, they, they were asked by God to think about shit with their little tiny monkey brains.
436200	441000	And they're like, this is a lot of shit to figure out. Yeah. The fact that this guy's dead and that
441000	446280	guy's alive. First of all, I'm supposed to make this year, but the, but also the deer was alive.
446280	451880	Yeah. Plus the fucking sun makes no sense at all. No, it, it, it picks and chooses when to come up
451880	457160	and go down. Sometimes it's there. Sometimes it's not. Yeah. And when it's not, it gets cold,
457160	462200	but sometimes it's hot. And then just when you think you got it figured out, you get hit by
462200	467800	lightning. Yeah. I feel like almost nothing makes sense. And then you're like, Oh no, it does make
467800	474600	sense. And then someone goes, no, no, black people. Right. That's something we can all get behind.
474600	481000	They're bad people. And then as a caveman, you go like, ah, got it. I know one thing. Oh, I figured
481000	485640	it out. I mean, it's anything, anything. Oh, see that log over there. When you knock on it three
485640	491560	times, it gives you a wish. Like try it. Oh, I wish for a sandwich. Okay. There's no sandwich.
491560	495320	You know why? Because you didn't, you didn't knock hard enough. You didn't have faith. We
495320	500360	occupy our brains with these systems. That's a, you know, you go to Las Vegas and you see these
500360	508040	fields of, of, uh, what awesome, uh, crap tables. No, because craps are actually, they're closer to
508040	512600	chaos than order. Craps are the best bet in the house. If you know how to play craps, that's
512600	516520	actually the, you know, the best way to actually make money. If you walk into Vegas with money,
516520	520120	not that there's any good way to make money. The house always wins, but the worst way is slot
520120	524760	machines. There's a fixed percentage you're going to lose, but it's the most appealing because you
524760	531080	go up and you pull the lever and the Adams family guy says like, Ooh, you win a jackpot.
534440	539240	Triple diamond. And then, and then you go, ah, triple diamond. And the thing spits out and you,
539240	543640	your girlfriend comes up and she goes, Hey, we're going to the hard rock for the thing. I almost,
543640	548040	I almost got this figured out though. I, I, you know, it's a, I pushed the two buttons and then
548040	553400	the triple diamond comes up. And I've, I've lost so many times in a row. I know that I'm going to
553400	563720	win now. And that is like racism. It is, it is. It's human, human, human, human slot machine.
563720	567720	Did I mention this on the show before I have a friend that used to work as a slots person,
567720	571400	like like in Vegas, she ran like, like the VIP slots and like she would take care of like high
571400	576360	roll or guests and stuff. And we were going through the MGM and she saw a woman sitting at
576360	580360	one of the more popular slot machines, the MGM lions. It's the one that's been there forever.
580360	584760	It's like, it makes all the money there. It's one machine. It's a, it's a bank of machines.
584760	590440	There's a row of this certain like brand of slot machine. And there's a woman sitting at one of
590440	594120	them and it was a progressive one. Like it was like something like this, like a little tally of
594200	597720	like money that comes up. And she looked at the numbers and she goes, Oh God, I want to go tell
597720	602440	that woman to move one to the left. She goes, that one's going to pay off soon. I'm like, wait, what?
603160	608200	Like she, she could, she knows which ones it's numbers and probability and stuff. She's like,
608200	612280	she's sitting at one. It's not going to pay off today. The one next to her will. That's crazy.
612280	617160	That just with numbers and a probability, you can predict it. Oh, and also they can tune them up.
617160	622680	Oh, they're cheating. Okay. And they don't give the old lady any money today. Also,
622680	626360	they put ones that pay off a little bit more often in, in walkways because they want those
626360	630120	bells to ring more because it attracts more people in. That's so smart. Yeah. It's really
630120	635240	sucked in like the, like the intestines of a, of an animal. And also in Las Vegas,
635240	638360	there's a thing where they don't allow you, if you walk through a casino, if you walk through
638360	643000	the floor of any casino in Las Vegas, you are not allowed to take more than a certain amount of
643000	647160	steps in a row without running into a place to put money in something. You cannot walk in a
647160	651960	straight line for more than like 10 paces anywhere. You have to, they need, you have to like walk
651960	656040	around a maze. You constantly have to go, you have to be stopped by a thing that you could put
656040	662600	money in. Sex of the city. Adams family, Transformers. I want to know how they base
662600	667800	that shit. Like, oh, people, people love the Transformers slot machine. They're going for
667800	672360	everything. Like sometimes you see like a 75 year old guy is just cranking that Transformers
672360	679720	machine. Transform and rule out. Bing, bing, bing. Look at the guy like you're not into Transformers.
679800	683240	He doesn't know about Megatron and Galvatron. But then again,
683240	686840	knowing that's not going to win you any more money. No, it's just kind of funny.
686840	692520	I've never been to Vegas. Is it awesome? What? Yeah, I've never been. Oh, this episode. We're
692520	704040	going to Vegas. We're floating through space on a green screen effect.
704760	713320	Oh, here come those neon signs. Vegas. Time to land. Is this a Vegas? Yeah,
713320	718760	we're landing on the strip. Look around you. There's circus circus. There's a creme brulee.
720280	726440	You guys ever fly to Las Vegas from like Burbank on a Friday morning? It is very sad. What's known
726440	731640	as the stripper express. It is you and 40 strippers all in like they're all fresh faced and they got
731640	737160	their juicy suits on and they're looking good and ready to go. And then you fly back on a on
737160	743560	a Sunday afternoon and it's just like the Cherokee Trail of Tears, man. And it's just a bunch of.
743560	749560	But they should be happy. No, no. They've been through hell. But they just worked. They're rich.
749560	754120	They're the richest crisis. But man, they're just faded. Oh, that's hard work. Yeah,
754120	759560	it's hard work. You have to give up parts of yourself. No, no, I don't doubt that at all.
759560	763160	I was just I was just confused. Like I thought I thought he meant like they didn't they didn't hit
763160	769480	the the mother lode. I'd never been to. I went to a strip club for the first time earlier this year.
769480	773800	And yeah, I was with Emil and I'd never been. We were in Portland. You went with your wife. Well,
773800	777320	it was a bunch of us. It was a music festival. I once said the names of the people I was with
777320	784040	because so we went in and I sat down and they had food. They had a full. Oh, yeah.
784040	789960	The fucking the strip club buffet is one of the oddest fucking. It's all over the place.
789960	794760	It's Chinese, but also the like Italian. Can I get some more pubes in my coleslaw,
794760	799720	please? I think it's weird to put that much mayonnaise near that much mayonnaise.
802280	810680	Open genitalia. I just I do because I working at having worked in food service where there are no
810680	818200	women like with their crotches above the food. You're still warned a lot about how how you know
818200	824760	how you know the air around us is filled with all kinds of beasties just looking for for a perch.
824760	829560	Looking for purchase. Yeah. And and there's a there's a zone. You know, you got to keep
829560	834120	icing that that coleslaw. You got to ice that that that they don't give it. They weren't giving
834120	839400	a shit about icing. Don't let these microbial organisms ever think for a second they have a
839400	849400	shot at having children. Black people again. Maybe. But but but but then to go in a strip
849400	854040	club and like it's all dark and there's like a lady dancing. Oh, yeah. Three feet from her crotch.
854040	861000	There's just crab legs and coleslaw. That's weird to me. Like I imagine how hardcore do you have to
861000	867000	be into her crotch to not grab something on the way in, you know, like like like at McDonald's
867000	870360	or something? Oh, yeah, to be like, well, you only have to you have to like, I want to eat and I
870360	878840	want to look at the strip club. Yeah. I have time for one stop. Yeah. Oh, I'll fill up there. Yeah.
878840	884520	It's not bad. That's gonna be a sad day when you're like, hey, this food is not bad.
885960	890040	But we were there and I didn't know how it worked. So they were like, my friend was like,
890040	897560	all right, every time they do a song, you have to go and give money. So their eyes were not smiling.
897560	904360	They did not want to be there. These strippers. And yeah, it was very sad. Go figure the saddest.
905880	910120	The saddest thing is they're on the pole. And when the shift changes, the other woman has to come
910120	915160	and like, she has to he has to sanitize the pole. But they're still trying to make like a thing of
915160	921960	it like while she's cleaning the car wash. Yeah. She's like sprinting and kind of doing a little
921960	925720	thing. Put your hands together for wipe down. Here she comes guys. Get your dollars ready.
925720	931320	Wipe downs coming out. I if you've not been to Jimbo's clown room, I recommend that you go.
931320	938600	Everybody. Jimbo's. Jimbo's clown room is kind of the last stop. It like Courtney Love used to dance
938600	944040	there. They call it the gateway to rock bottom. Exactly. And it's like it's it's it's druggy in
944040	948120	there. Like it's pretty like there's a lot of heroin addicts on that stage. What are the girls
948120	954040	like? It ranges. It used to be they put it they kind of put a paint job on Jimbo's. It's a little
954040	958120	tiny place. It's very small. You could buy a drink and tip the stage at the same time. It's really
958120	963800	like it's very little in there. And don't touch anything at the Jimbo's clown room. It's it's
963800	970280	unclean. And there was a girl that used to dance there. This Latina lady who was a dude and post
970520	977000	Latina lady who was a dude. An ex gentleman. Okay. Up there dancing around under you know a new
977000	984280	identity. Dancing around in a new identity. I think that's the name of her autobiography.
985560	989800	She had a bullwhip and she'd come out and she would frequently hurt somebody in the crowd. Like
989800	994120	you're like it's not big enough to swing a bullwhip in there. And she was constantly just like like
994120	998760	maiming somebody in the front row. And she would do a thing and some frat boys would roll in because
998760	1001720	they'd read about it and they'd heard that you know Courtney Love before she started murdering
1001720	1009560	husbands used to work there and stuff. Hey she murdered one husband. All right. I'm sorry.
1009560	1016040	I take that back. Just one. Just the one. And and she would do this thing. So good.
1016680	1021880	She was kind of a like a rock star. She would light a cigarette and then you know there's a
1021880	1026520	little brass railing about a foot you know like kind of six inches above the lining the edge of
1026520	1031480	the stage. I guess keep her from going headlong into the crowd you know. But it's a little brass
1031480	1036440	railing and she would light a cigarette and put it on balance on the on the rail with the lit end
1036440	1042440	out. And then do a headstand. So now picture her on her head with her ass facing the crowd like
1042440	1048680	like her for her facing away. Ass facing out. And then she would do a back bend and pick up
1049240	1054760	the cigarette with her ass cheeks then press back up into a headstand and do smoke rings out of her
1054760	1059640	ass. She would like. She would like fart a little bit. I think just the air pressure flexing her
1059640	1064600	like kind of like flexing her ass cheeks. I can't even picture it in my head. She would puff smoke
1064600	1068680	out of her ass and then she would go down to a frat boy in the front row and put it into and
1068680	1075320	the guy's mouth and be like yeah. And the greatest thing in the world. People died every week. The
1075320	1078360	greatest thing in the world is to be in the bathroom later on you go you know that's a dude
1078360	1092280	right. Because that's their deal breaker. I thought I was. I thought I thought I was Carrie Grant.
1092280	1099320	I thought I thought I was ingesting the fecal matter of a female stripper. Not one that used
1099320	1108040	to be a male. Who's in pain tonight? There's a big flock here. All right there's a hand
1108040	1112760	that shot up ma'am in the glasses. Are you are you willing to share your pain? Are you willing
1112760	1119240	to share it up here? Okay we don't bully people. You want to come up and come up here? I don't know
1119240	1129320	why people laugh at that. I guess sometimes we do. What's your name? My name is Miranda Harmon.
1129320	1132840	Miranda Harmon? Yeah. H-A-R-M-O-N? Are you from the future?
1133960	1138280	I'm your daughter from the future. That's exactly how I picture my daughter.
1139400	1144280	Bad news. Don't eat mangoes.
1148280	1151400	Do you think maybe we're related? I don't know. Well actually no.
1152120	1159640	My family's last name used to be Hamburger. Hamburger? During World War II we changed it to
1159640	1167880	Harmon. Oh like the comedian? Do you guys know Hamburger? Yeah Hamburger. Wait your family's
1167880	1172840	last name was Hamburger? Yeah. Awesome. My parents are. Oh the hamburgers are here.
1172840	1181720	Are you from Germany? Yeah. Did your family live in a hamlet?
1183880	1191800	It's possible. Yeah. It's funny my grandparents on my mom's side are German. Their last name,
1191800	1200280	my mom's maiden name is Reek. R-I-E-C-K but it used to be pronounced Reich and they made a strategic
1200280	1206280	decision to alter the pronunciation. That's a very common thing back then. There's a place
1206280	1211960	in Wisconsin called New Berlin. It's just a town, a delightful little town, great place to go
1212920	1220760	buy some antiques, some souvenirs. New Berlin. Berlin not Berlin. Not New Berlin. It was New
1220760	1226200	Berlin at one point but it became, I grew up, I was like oh let's go to New Berlin. Just make
1226200	1231400	that decision at some point. You have to. Otherwise you just start calling it something else.
1232280	1239640	I like the Reich thing. That's crazy. That's a solid thing. You know a legacy is bad when
1239640	1249160	you choose the word reek as a last name. It was reek all along. His name is Adolf. So it's Maria
1249160	1258840	you said? Miranda. You nodded and said Miranda like I was right. Close enough. Not close enough.
1258840	1266360	Call me on that. Miranda, what's your pain? Well, so I don't know what I want to do.
1268360	1273880	I'm 21 years old and I feel like I went to the wrong school and I feel like I have no idea
1274840	1280440	where and I feel like the only thing I know how to do is make things and be creative and I feel
1280440	1284840	like that's the only way I know really how to connect to the world and so I'm worried that I'm
1284840	1290920	never going to be happy. Well, if you're never happy you could actually make money creating
1290920	1298040	things. That's good business. Thank you so much for coming Miranda. I guess that's probably
1298040	1301960	actually a really harsh thing. We have a word for happy people in the creative sector. They're
1301960	1309080	called welders because they know exactly what to do and when to do it and they sleep like babies
1309080	1319000	at night. Everyone else is just like horrible hack. But you're 21. By the way, this isn't the
1319000	1325080	first time someone's come up here with that particular pain. White people problems. You
1325800	1331080	don't know what to do. You're 21. I could hit you on the head with a bottle
1331640	1335720	and you could be unconscious for eight years. You would wake up and you'd still be ahead of schedule.
1341240	1346440	Maybe that's me being 40. But it seems like you could waste a lot of time.
1347240	1352040	You do have time. Like they say you know 40 is the new 30. 21 is the new 11.
1355560	1359560	Do whatever you want. If you're here with your parents that means you have a support system.
1360120	1365560	Unlike a lot of people, your job if you want to be a creative is to kind of fuck around for a while.
1365560	1369800	Why do you say you went to the wrong school? Well I went to a liberal arts college and it's
1369800	1374600	lovely but then I decided well okay so I always knew I wanted to be like a cartoonist or an animator.
1377480	1384520	I look back that daffy duck is sitting there. Keep making us. And I thought that by going to a
1384520	1389000	liberal arts college I would want to be something else. I would learn how to be like a doctor
1389960	1396680	or a teacher or something different I guess. I don't know why. But then it's my senior year
1396680	1399720	and it turns out I still really want to do animation but there's no animation program at
1399720	1409560	my school. And so now I'm kind of wondering what. Oops. You're just you're feeling the
1409560	1414120	embarrassment of like I don't know what to say. What sort of animation do you want to do?
1415240	1420120	What's your dream job? Like pie in the sky. Don't embarrass yourself. Aim way too big.
1421240	1430760	Like a storyboard artist on Adventure Time. Or a graphic novelist or something. Something
1430760	1434120	where I get to draw. These things are within reach and they don't pay much more than what you're
1434120	1442920	doing now. I mean where are you from? I'm from Orlando, Florida. Are you visiting here or are
1443000	1448600	you living here? No my family and I are kind of taking a trip up the west coast. Really? Looking
1448600	1452520	at school. So you live in Orlando? You're going to school in Orlando right now? No I actually go
1452520	1458760	to school in Baltimore. Okay where? It's called Goucher College. Okay. Yeah. Goucher? Goucher.
1458760	1464920	Oh Goucher. Yeah. Well but at least you get to be in Baltimore. Oh it's wonderful. It's a perfect
1464920	1472680	view of Hamster Dam. Yeah. I'm really lucky and I shouldn't say. So you're touring up the west
1472680	1478920	coast because you kind of have a feeling. You're feeling west coasty about your future. Your
1478920	1483720	college. Yeah eventually yeah or where I live. And your parents are cool enough that they're
1483720	1488360	just indulging this pilgrimage and kind of. My parents are wonderful. Yeah. Yeah. I mean.
1489240	1493480	The hamburgers. That's awesome. What are their names? What are your parents names?
1494440	1503160	Hamburgers. Show yourself. You're the hamburgers. Wow a guy that looks like like like prime prime
1503160	1513000	sexy Sean Connery just stood up. Like like perfect. Zardoz. Yeah that's Zardoz Connery. Yeah like like
1513560	1518200	super duper like perfect Sean Connery like stood up in a denim shirt and flexed.
1519480	1523560	I mean there's there's other bad news there too. I'm just being an asshole when I say this but.
1523560	1528680	I'll be having having cool parents. Another another nail in the coffin of creativity.
1529560	1535320	Oh yeah no listen my my parents did everything right. I think. Yeah that's the problem. No no no
1537000	1542680	it's it's really good though. It is. But Lena. Lena Dunham had good parents right. Yeah yeah
1543080	1548200	and she's a great writer. So like like I don't know I'm always jaded and go like I'm always
1548200	1551080	making that joke like you have to hate your parents you have to hate yourself you have to
1551080	1556760	be an alcoholic you have to do all this stuff. I'm just justifying myself. The hardest thing
1556760	1561960	for me graduating college was up until this point there are sections of your life have
1561960	1565000	periods of your life have already been sectioned off like you're going to be in this grade this
1565000	1569320	grade this grade then you're college for four years and after that you sort of have to create
1569400	1573720	your own periods you know like you don't want to be the person who's been doing the same thing
1573720	1580840	for 10 years and you're like shit I'm still where I was after college but you know what I just sort
1580840	1586360	of do what you want to do and you don't I don't think you need to go to school you guys can thank
1586360	1593080	me later I don't think you need to go to a school you could just there's plenty of really talented
1593080	1597240	people here and you could go online and figure out how to do it and just start doing it you know
1597240	1606200	and then see how it feels she just excused herself I love that yeah no that's great that's
1606200	1617960	that that that bodes well for her future thank you Miranda I would say if you want to be a
1617960	1625720	graphic novelist change your name to Miranda hamburger I'd buy that yeah yeah the war is over
1626120	1630600	I mean I want to watch a cartoon and I want to see a title card that says created by Miranda
1630600	1635320	hamburger and then I want to find out that that was actually your name and yeah yeah I'm getting
1635320	1646520	pretty tired of the word Harmon on stuff me too yeah garbage it's like low rent Apatow
1646520	1655720	uh so I just because we we did Harmon quest uh yesterday last night and I'm not gonna that's
1655720	1660920	not gonna be the final title of what we did this D&D thing where Spencer D&D uh DMS and uh
1660920	1665560	we play and we're gonna animate it the working title for cinefamily as Harmon quest and I
1665560	1672360	suddenly realized Jesus Christ we're like Batman we gotta get my name like like I said I think we
1672440	1677800	can beat that title and somebody was like why that's great and I was like no I think this thing
1677800	1683000	could actually be good yeah like I don't want I don't want somebody somebody that could watch
1683000	1688120	this thing having to think that they have to drink the Kool-Aid of some Kevin Smithy like like the
1688120	1694680	guys like there's more to it than that like the thing we did last night is awesome like I think
1694680	1699320	is gonna be really really amazing and I and I would hope that it would please a lot more people
1699320	1703080	that are capable of liking me we should open it up to the uh if you guys if you guys think of a
1703080	1709000	good name for our our animated campaign uh that we're gonna do uh we're open to suggestions were
1709000	1717000	any of you guys there last night at the it was awesome all right uh let's bring out the lovely
1717000	1719880	Erin McGathey
1729560	1737240	hi hello uh I was born uh the new astrological sign is my new sign what is it what is it a
1737240	1742600	officious officious officious is it that's my pronunciation am I pronouncing it wrong what is it
1743400	1753240	afuyukas I know right Adam go over to the rescue is it afuyukas yep okay afuyukas which is uh
1753240	1759080	November 29th to December 17th and I was born on December 5th so so there's 13 signs now
1760040	1765640	yes what's the symbol of afuyukas there isn't one because there isn't a symbol no
1766440	1772360	because astrology is a made-up uh game uh the symbol is a strawberry uh writing a bull
1773640	1778760	but it isn't there supposed to be an attendant uh constellation that that a part of the sky
1778760	1784120	that yeah they don't just make those up out of you know thin air I mean they kind of actually do
1786120	1790040	they literally look to the skies and they're like yeah that looks like a ball does it look like a
1790040	1796760	ball I think that means that that uh that myself and other people born during that time where it's
1796760	1804440	a wild card thing I can just say maybe people born during that time are insecure but but charming
1805560	1810280	maybe you guys aren't tied to a destiny and you can do whatever you want because the rest of us
1810280	1816040	are on the tracks that are dictated by our horoscopes but you guys do whatever you want
1816040	1824040	yeah I was that terrible guy in high school that would read uh astral the zodiac things uh
1824040	1829080	to people I would go here let me what's your sign and I would read a different one
1829080	1833800	and then get them to go like oh my god that's true I want to get all flipped out then we got I read
1833800	1841720	a different one that's it's not you I think you telling them that is the bad part because otherwise
1841720	1847240	it would just be for you but this is also for them that's right no I'm just saying I used to be
1847240	1852520	I used to be that dick and I've met a lot I then I had a relationship with a girl who was so into
1852520	1856920	astrology it was ridiculous and it was like it was such a it was a challenge at first because
1856920	1862200	I was like come on but then over time the way I coped with it is I would go oh well actually
1862200	1867160	she's coping with life a little better than me in a lot of ways like like someone would spill
1867160	1874600	something on her new dress at a party and she would go like well it's such a gemini
1875560	1880840	and and not get upset even though she was not like the most noble of people she sounds dumb
1888520	1893880	yeah you'd rate this stink right because you're not tied to any destiny you guys can do whatever
1894600	1899080	yeah I was a shitty person in high school who who had interpret dreams
1900840	1906040	you just tell people well I clay I read a like dream dictionary and then claimed that I was able
1906040	1910520	to interpret dreams and would stand in a certain doorway and people come and tell me their dreams
1910520	1917000	stand in a certain doorway yeah there's a certain doorway but where the door is never opened and I
1917800	1923160	would the certain doorway but the door is never open yes what are you saying what it sounds like
1924440	1928280	yeah at my high school there was some door I don't know if it was like a janitor's closet or something
1929400	1932360	no one ever that's romantic than the way you describe it
1934200	1941800	what I'm saying is that there is that this uh enclave is that a word enclave enclave uh
1942360	1948840	where I would stand and people would come and uh how did you get in there if the door didn't open
1948840	1954360	well it was just like it was it was a it was a like if there was a wall then there was a part
1954360	1958760	that went in and there were doors there because it was a doorway but no one used it and I would
1958760	1963480	stand there and that's where I would interpret a little a little recess in a hallway yeah we're
1963480	1970600	asking the wrong question she's talking about how she used to read people's dreams how did you
1970600	1976440	stand there we're all armchair architects yeah how did you say was there a load-bearing pillar
1977880	1982280	I'm just trying to get a visual idea because before you told us why you stood I pictured Lucy's
1982280	1986680	uh from peanuts as little the doctor is in little clothes well I was putting a door that never
1986680	1991000	opened or closed I thought that she just goes through she was like like how did you get in
1991000	1994760	there was like an egg at the christy riddle or something like there's a puddle of water on the
1994760	1998760	floor and a dead man in the corner and the peacock feather in his hand
1998760	2004760	yeah it was a place where no one stood so I stood there did you oh that's very profound
2005720	2010120	did you uh did you feel qualified to do this did you feel like you had some sort of
2010120	2015800	oh there's some fucking tension happening right now the two dream warriors
2020440	2026120	got it do you want do you thought you were cool so uh who told you you had the right to do this
2026120	2033480	shit were you all born with it or I mean like I mean did you read a book or did you think that
2033480	2039240	you had you had the stuff yes I read a book and I it wasn't diabolical I really thought I knew
2039240	2045960	uh everything also like I've always been a very sensitive person so a lot of it was my own
2045960	2051800	feelings about the person I was talking to you are standing in a doorway right now yeah maybe
2051800	2058360	maybe you're a little self-important and that's a stairway uh but I had read this
2058360	2063400	dream dictionary embarrassing thing it's not I don't know I don't know I'm in high school
2063400	2071240	right what's a dictionary uh look you can look at things like uh teeth your teeth falling out
2071240	2076200	what is that money money is it really money yeah when your teeth are rotting and falling out
2076200	2082040	that's money money well I've also read its health which makes sense too I used to have you're such a
2082040	2088280	gem all the time yeah but uh I think it's more I mean I think it's so much more personal than
2088280	2092440	that I don't I don't I don't doubt that there's I think the reason why we think that there's these
2092440	2097320	universal symbols is kind of Jungian oh a horse means this and teeth falling out means that
2097320	2106040	is because things like teeth falling out probably does mean uh a lot of very similar things to
2106040	2112600	most people but but I think the bottom line is like you go to bed and your your brain fires off
2112600	2117000	like this random thing there's these lightning bolts that race through your synaptic pathways
2117000	2122040	and unlike when your conscious mind is in control they're just it's just sort of random it's like
2122040	2126680	this pachinko machine so there's things that are on your mind and then there's just random chaos
2126680	2131880	and like you have these weird hallucinations that time is passing that you have an identity
2131880	2136280	that you're encountering other people that there there are places you're going but what's really
2136280	2141080	happening is your brain is just sort of like it's sort of like the tide rolling in over a sand castle
2141080	2146040	kind of like just uh or as I said lightning going through pudding and kind of just just going to
2146040	2151960	these different places so you wake up and you go like why why why did John Travolta drive that
2151960	2157720	train into a mountain and then it exploded and that gave me the power to tell uh Bruce Willis
2157800	2164200	to go fuck himself and then you come to a book and go well Bruce Willis means strength
2165640	2171000	but he does Bruce Willis means to me he does uh Bruce Willis means something to that to that
2171000	2174760	dreamer is like so Erin you were standing here in your little recess in the hallway
2174760	2180760	and did you have to bark up a crowd was there a sign like how did this work did you have flyers
2180760	2186040	put up no no no like I like good little things they could rip off and it would just say the
2186040	2195640	doorway on it uh the place where no one stands it started with me just doing it casually like in
2195640	2199800	passing edit lunch and I also like I really thought that I was good at it like I had read
2199800	2207160	that dictionary and then just let it go so I really I really was just pretending to be a
2207160	2211400	therapist I guess in my own mind but I wasn't bullshitting I thought that I was but it was
2211480	2216520	legit um but eventually there was such a high demand that I had to find a doorway you probably
2216520	2220920	were good at it relative to your other high school classmates because you're an intuitive person
2220920	2226920	right and this in the same way that I insisted that I become a student uh peer counselor at
2226920	2231800	my high school I was like if anyone has any problems no one came to me but I was an official
2232520	2237800	I was an official peer counselor at my high school but no one ever came to me because they
2237800	2244040	were adult counselors so you had well you had two jobs you were the peer counselor and you also
2244040	2250680	were the dream interpreter I guess so that's pretty good that's like there was a portion where I I
2250680	2256680	got really into hypnotizing people I fancy myself what I read I read a bunch of books about hypnosis
2256680	2260280	and you know like all hypnotists will tell you that there's no such thing as hypnotic state it's
2260280	2267400	just a you know a state of enhanced relaxation and openness to uh suggestibility and stuff
2268040	2273320	and I used to go to parties with uh Matt Gorley and part of being like hypnotizing people is you
2273320	2277320	have a someone else go up and go is she the guy with her the guy wants to talk with him oh yeah
2277320	2282680	the liar yeah yeah yeah exactly no the liar number one I'm the big liar anything like that
2282680	2287720	he's a hypnotist he can hypnotize you and like and you find people that are open to that idea
2287720	2291320	and I would walk up to people and I would go like oh it's like hypnotize me and I go okay um
2292520	2297800	it's easy to forget things uh so um like it's like even things that you know like just for
2297800	2302120	instance like I could ask you a question that you know the answer to but you might not be able
2302120	2305560	to tell me the answer you start waving your hands around a little bit and they start getting ready
2305560	2310040	to be hypnotized and you go like you what's your what's your name Aaron see you're I'm bad at it
2310040	2313480	now no but I actually got to the point where I could do that and people go like
2314360	2319320	uh and they they would pretend to not know their name it was really like and then I would knock
2319320	2322920	people out and make them think that like oh they're just they've just hypnotized themselves
2322920	2326760	yeah that's that's that's a Kreskin said he paid like what three hundred thousand dollars or
2326760	2329960	something like that if anybody could prove to him there was such a thing as a hypnotic state you
2329960	2340280	know I remember go I remember uh going to uh pass adena to the ice house comedy club because my
2340280	2345800	Armenian plumber neighbor had won one of those comedy contests where they paper the house and
2345800	2350440	they they they brought him a limo and stuff he's like I got I got eight tickets to the
2350440	2357720	pasadena ice house comedy club motherfucker we gotta go and I was like all right I'll go and uh
2358680	2364600	we we we piled in the limo we were literally the only eight people in the pasadena ice house
2364600	2370040	and it wasn't a comedian it was a hypnotist and I had seen these guys like like identical acts
2370040	2375880	that came to my high school and stuff so I had I had gleaned this what was happening so I faked
2377160	2381400	being hypnotizable if you know they do a thing where they go like hold your hands above your
2381400	2386120	head and now you can't put them down and I purposely didn't put him down because I knew
2386120	2393240	he needed somebody up there I went up there and sat in a chair and did 45 minutes with this guy
2393960	2399400	where he would go like you're a chinese rapper and I'd go chaka chaka ching chaka chaka like
2400360	2402840	like like I was just doing bad improv
2404600	2413800	like wait what's bad about chaka chaka ching chaka as ask Rosie O'Donnell I I I I did yeah I mean it
2413800	2419000	was it was in that in that case racist and then other shit was like okay you're naked now you're
2419000	2425560	naked and I would act like I thought I was naked I was up there for full 45 doing this guy's act
2425640	2432040	like like he wasn't doing anything but wearing a gross suit and like ask it's suggesting that I
2432040	2436360	there was like no different from comedy sports except for a lot of key differences like a lot
2436360	2440200	of like a lot of like the stage hypnotist will literally like I've had friends that went up there
2440200	2444920	and were the the you know the guests that had were brought up and they'll go like hey help me out
2444920	2451480	don't whisper to you like help me out here and like oh so am I you go sleep they just say like
2451560	2457160	don't make me look like a fucking dick up yeah I bet that's most of that's that's what this guy
2457160	2462360	didn't have to say that the the the these silence in the room the empty chairs were speaking that
2462360	2468520	how was the limorite back for you they were like all my neighbors kept going like well what did you
2468520	2473560	what what was happening was it magical would you were did you remember anything and it was like
2473560	2479000	well I I remember I kind of split the difference oh okay I was sort of like well I kind of felt like
2479000	2484360	really relaxed and I sort of just wanted to do I didn't I just I I threaded a needle where I
2484360	2489800	didn't lie to anybody but did this guy's act didn't kind of kind of it was really sad yeah
2489800	2494920	the ice houses of dark I remember the the the it's never been darker than when I was
2494920	2499560	rapping in Chinese uh that was insane
2509320	2514440	you can't say here's I mean it's a it's a new world if I if I if the words ching chong
2514440	2521000	or anything else came out of my mouth fucking TMZ headline what do you mean if it came out of your
2521000	2527560	mouth you just did that I mean I'm hoping that the absurdity of the of the context like how
2527560	2533240	surgical would they have to be to pull that out not very there's a sonic five seconds there were
2534040	2540360	there were people at the I did the the TCAs and there were I I said at one point I said in my
2540360	2546680	babbling I said yeah because somebody asked me like basically his question was like don't you
2546680	2551960	think you could be more successful if you shut up or something you know some kind of pharisee
2551960	2558360	question uh and uh and I was like I was like I was like I was like I don't know I I guess I'm
2558360	2564920	I'm doing okay by my own uh standards and I say stuff and and I I get to be on honest ground and
2564920	2569880	you know uh that that that helps me sleep at night and sometimes people can pull stuff out
2569880	2574280	of context and that helps them sell the cardiads and that's fine too I accept that and then there
2574280	2582040	was like the live tweeting was like Dan Harmon blames uh the media for his uh uh out of context
2582040	2589480	quotations and it was like so meta like like what are you doing what are you doing stop it uh
2590040	2596840	doesn't matter I don't I don't care uh all right so let's get Spencer up here let's get him
2597720	2599720	go
2605320	2612760	bring your satchel and your flannel jacket bring your beard and I can hold hello
2612760	2613640	sitting down
2615960	2620760	do you have what did you did you enjoy doing the show yesterday it was a culmination of oh
2621480	2627560	yeah I was I was freaking out Spencer is now like you came to the show one night
2628120	2633640	telling your friends in the car on the way over I feel like I should play D&D with Dan Harmon
2633640	2637960	and then that night I said is there a dungeon master here because I had this thing like let's
2637960	2644440	play D&D in the show flash forward to we played D&D in this show now we're doing D&D and this
2644440	2649160	stop animated thing that we're recording and you come over to my house on Tuesday nights
2649160	2653960	that's what I was thinking about we have a private session yeah I was it's almost like
2653960	2659560	and he's your assistant so he comes over more than just and sometimes I'm just in your house
2660280	2665960	but you have three D&D campaigns that are going at it once I was texting Jeff like that was one
2665960	2671480	of the things I've really been thinking about is like you get like did you think when you saw me
2671480	2676360	you know like oh I'm probably going to be playing three separate games of D&D with this person in
2676360	2682920	the future like I could do four man I'm I'm into it yeah yeah I'm just you in this show do you have
2682920	2689800	other uh other games that you play outside of our group of friends better or not no do you you do
2689800	2698120	you do how pretty are they no I'd tell you guys would you would you hey you didn't you didn't
2698120	2701800	tell us when we went to that room full of mirrors in our private session that all we had to do is
2701800	2709320	smash all the mirrors wait you found a box of rocks in the room before we spent look hey yeah
2709320	2714200	but there were eight different colors of laser bouncing around the room we walk into a room and
2714200	2718440	it's a it's a maze of mirrors and there's a big ball of light in the middle of this room if you
2718440	2723000	can get to it it's shooting different colored lasers that are reflecting all around the thing
2723000	2727800	and you can you if you reflect it back into the thing it comes out different colors
2727800	2732040	and then we made a big white light that blasted a giant hole and then there was a look here's
2732040	2740280	what we spent fucking three hours three hours moving mirrors holding up pieces of paper to
2740280	2746040	the leaders reminiscent of the first dungeon yeah Dan kept sending his little snake uh what's his
2746040	2752040	name lasseter Denny Denny Denny uh Dan is a snake and we kept sending a snake around to go and
2752040	2757720	recon mission because it was low enough to not get hit by the lasers and we spent a good
2757960	2762440	most of our lives in that in that fucking room finally Rob Sharp was like I go into the room
2762440	2767160	with a rock star and I take a rock and I go boot do do do do and I threw it at the thing and that
2767160	2772440	was it now here's my problem with that Spencer here's my problem I think I think my theory is
2772440	2777320	you let us out of that thing because you felt bad for us okay because there was a little there was
2777320	2781400	a big mirror and then there was a little side mirror on the on the on the wall that was that
2781400	2785800	was directly facing the thing and you got all excited when you started getting lights to bounce
2785800	2789800	back and forth out of that that seemed like a thing and then and then all of a sudden we could
2789800	2793880	have just broken it there was a way to get out of there all right what happened Spencer okay okay
2794520	2800120	okay Jeff has theorized the same thing before like it's it's a big deal like this isn't well he's not
2800120	2806600	entirely wrong I mean yeah you you you had pity the whole time all of those mirrors were completely
2806600	2811640	breakable with the condition that they were enchanted and the shards would float up and
2811720	2816840	slice at you as you broke them but at the same time that's how you get through but you know you
2816840	2821880	were doing the red blue green lasers and you were trying to get them at that same mirror that was
2821880	2826440	the solution except you had them so they were separately hitting and all of you guys were
2826440	2830040	holding up the mirrors but if you tweaked them so they're touching at the same spot and all the
2830040	2834600	colors combined into white light that would also open the door so it was double-sided we were on
2834600	2840440	the right kind of path yeah and then you abandoned it and I was like oh shit I wasn't I wasn't there
2840520	2847800	for that session well how do you weigh in I'm having a tough time seeing this room in my head
2847800	2852040	it was tough seeing it with the with the map I drew too it was pretty shit all right look
2852600	2858200	listen tough guy we're we're this is a new kind of episode of harmotown we're fucking rolling
2858200	2866280	up our sleeves we're gonna dnd the fuck out of the shit get your get your shit out get your get
2866280	2871880	your dice get your shit get your pencils I'm not even I'm not even that drunk yet
2872600	2877800	well Spencer you wish to like play dnd with Harmon came true in like a monkey's paw kind of way
2878600	2885320	because it's like every waking moment will be dnd with Dan Harmon get out of your characters
2886280	2891240	the characters Spencer do you ever oh can I say oh sorry I was gonna change the topic for a second
2891240	2895560	before we did dnd but no go ahead I was gonna say this real quick I don't think I've talked
2895560	2898840	about we were talking about the dream thing when you're sleeping in weird shit happens
2898840	2902040	like uh you know it just you're like when you punch your mom
2903480	2906600	guys that was told why are you gonna bring up old shit
2908600	2913720	literally like many years old um I okay I didn't know what that means
2914280	2919800	what Kumail punches mom when he was coming out of anesthesia I remember okay I didn't okay I didn't
2919800	2927480	do it on purpose I mean I did technically do it on purpose but um I moved to the US and I'll say
2927480	2931000	this real quick about my grandfather and I had like really weird relations like we didn't get
2931000	2935160	along and then I was in the US and he died and I couldn't go back for his funeral and I felt like
2935160	2939720	you know we had unresolved issues and I was felt really bad about it for like a week and then I had
2939720	2945480	a dream and I don't believe you know you didn't believe in that Jeff Davis shit I don't I don't
2945480	2953000	believe like ghost stuff whatever it's like uh but he came in my dream and we talked and then I
2953000	2957800	didn't feel weird after that and my brain some part of my brain realized that that's what I needed
2957800	2965320	to have happen in a dream right to be able to move past that yeah so it's not always like random
2965320	2970920	like sometimes it's I well no not not always random at all I mean I mean because our unconscious
2970920	2977160	minds are absolutely containment units and pathways to the things that are truly important
2977160	2983160	so that's why dreams that's why we remember them at all because they totally resonate like we wake
2983160	2989320	up and go holy shit I I don't know other people are different but nine times out of ten when I
2989320	2993960	wake up I don't I don't remember having dreamed at all and then other people like every night
2993960	3001080	like Erin's like oh I'm dreaming oh she's like a dream junkie um but like I but I think the bottom
3001080	3007080	line is that like if if if it if what happens in your unconscious mind resonates with your conscious
3007080	3013880	mind ie if this weird random kind of like like dragon's lair lightning path kind of like creates
3013880	3020840	a pattern that that can mean something to your forebrain then when you wake up you go oh wow
3020920	3027320	that's weird that John Travolta attacked me with a pencil uh what does that mean uh that's fair
3027320	3034040	of impotence it's just insanity other times it's like not even anything but I think the stuff
3034040	3040280	that's brewing down there is definitely absolutely important and I I I there's there's a scientific
3040280	3044920	and spiritual explanation for your dad coming to you in your dream or grandpa coming to your
3044920	3049320	dream and you resolving that I think I think that's a that's a place where science and and
3049320	3054200	religion both totally overlap right I mean it sounds like you've come to peace like you came
3054200	3059720	to peace with your relationship with your grandpa it's it seemed like you were doing a bit didn't
3059720	3063800	it seem like she's like okay move along there's a long line there's like 18 people behind will you
3063800	3069640	carry my uh my book stuff for you you're exactly right oh you were doing a bit you were doing the
3069640	3074520	dream interpreter okay I used to I used to she was at the doorway can I say really quick how that
3074520	3083800	ended how do you end uh a friend of mine uh called bullshit and came to me with a fake dream
3084520	3087080	and I he Dan Harbend you
3089560	3095320	reading the wrong horoscope he gave me this really elaborate uh dream and I I took a long
3095320	3099480	time interpreting it and then at the end of it was like I just made that up because uh
3099480	3104200	because this is this is this is fake because this is too much power for one woman to have
3104920	3110120	stop standing where no one stands we're turning this into a walmart yeah
3111800	3116440	we're like making that my my emotional experience with interpreting his dream and then finding out
3116440	3122760	that it wasn't real made me never do it again oh no it's fine it's fine he was just lying to you
3122760	3126600	and then later I would just talk to people about their feelings okay well you can you interpret a
3126600	3135640	dream that I've had a couple times sure okay there's this huge oh my god no back my superman
3135640	3140920	working together because because the obvious answer is gay because I I had a dream I used to
3140920	3144920	have a dream once in a while that my dick kept coming off it just went it would just detach
3144920	3149640	would it go off on its own or was it dead it was like and it would it would turn to you and it
3149640	3155960	would say I wish I was in a butt yeah follow me but stop putting me in vaginas and put me on
3156280	3160920	but yeah I want to try to do this for real and what in what situation would it well okay here's
3160920	3163640	the dream and this is embarrassing but I'm gonna tell you I want you to interpret this I mean I
3163640	3169480	don't think it requires all that much interpretation I think it's just vanity but I was in a dream
3169480	3172920	having a sex dream I have a lot of sex dreams I'm kind of James Bond in my dream it's it's
3172920	3178840	fucking and fighting at all times in my dreams are you fucking real women or dream women dream
3178840	3183640	women are they like oh that one looks like Jennifer Lawrence or whatever or are you making
3183720	3186760	them up sometimes they're actual people sometimes that's that kind of that morphing thing where
3186760	3190600	you're with somebody and they kind of morph into someone else and stuff okay but uh I was uh
3191400	3198680	going down on a gal uh administering the uh you're even you're so philatio and uh so your dream
3198680	3206120	sex has like elaborate like foreplay oh yeah oh absolutely oh fucking last night I said you're
3206120	3211080	such a great sex dream last night uh some some big tattooed rock people they chick just laid
3211080	3214680	me up on a bar I just started sucking my dick right in the bar and everyone else everyone was
3214680	3222840	really bummed out but I was like everyone was bummed out they were oh no I like this bar
3228920	3233080	so I'm going down in this gal and then and as I'm doing it I realize that I
3233080	3241480	she has a dick but it's my dick so you know I'm sucking my dick on a girl and the whole time I
3241480	3246040	think she's all into it she's not gonna come she's like she's loving it and the whole time
3246040	3251160	I'm thinking I don't want to come in my own mouth you're you're nervous about your taxes
3252120	3260600	okay all right and and and you can recognize your own dick yeah what is that about I see my dick
3260680	3267800	more than any other dick yes well does it does it wear a hat what is it sometimes it does
3268840	3272520	it tastes like brunette bronca sometimes it affects a little cape and a smart cane
3274360	3281320	I had a dream once it has Calvin peeing on a vagina on it tattooed that's when I was uh when
3281320	3287960	I was like a teenager I distinctly remember a dream I had where I was a woman and I was getting
3288680	3297080	from you I was in it I was in my kitchen sink and I was a woman like a baby I was a teenager
3297080	3303400	I was let's say 17 I was like in the height of my like and a guy was fucking you in the sink yeah
3303400	3310600	and I was a woman and I was enjoying it I'm frequently a woman uh see I made that up I wanted
3310600	3316840	to get him to oh in my dreams I'm off on a woman in my dreams that's the name of this episode by
3316920	3320840	the way I'm offered a woman in my dreams I was I forget it well I'm frequently a woman
3321320	3327640	one dream I was I was uh I was Mary Ann from uh from Gilligan's island I was getting I was
3327640	3331960	getting fucked by the professor but the skipper the skipper kept coming in and fucking bumming
3331960	3339160	out our action and the professor got so mad listen to your voicemails and uh
3339160	3348040	and then another time I was uh who's the daughter on good times Thelma Thelma I was Thelma the
3348040	3352760	sexy daughter from good from good times remembers that sitcom and I was getting fucked by JJ
3354200	3362440	so you were doing rule 34 uh stuff in your dreams before what's that uh is it rule 34 is that yeah
3362440	3367960	that's the the internet if it exists there is porn of it yeah yeah I was doing my own
3367960	3373960	rule 34 of the internet is that if if it exists there is porn of it right I've never been a woman
3373960	3381400	in my dreams I feel like lame kind of maybe tonight I've never been been close to a woman in
3381400	3387400	my dreams I've never even been anybody else I'm always me in my dreams not even the professor
3388440	3394360	I mean sometimes the way professor garb but I still me Dan you're saying you wouldn't recognize
3394440	3400040	your own dick in a dream I mean it's just this little guy it's just what is it I mean what is it
3400040	3409400	I see it from the top it's just like a little pink choo-choo train I assume it looks the same as
3409400	3414120	Adam Goldberg's I don't know like there's only one way to find out if Adam Goldberg
3414120	3417800	Adam get up here Adam get up here no we're kidding we're kidding we're kidding
3419560	3424200	if I saw it coming at me I wouldn't I wouldn't go that's my dick no but I bet if you saw a dick
3424200	3430440	that wasn't yours you'd be like that's not my dick well yeah if it was gigantic and effective
3431640	3437240	gigantic and effective if it was it was if it was half inside a very uh happy person
3439160	3440920	I'd be like that can't be my dick
3442760	3446600	I would always recognize mine because I have a horrible zipper scar
3447400	3453000	whoa from circumcision you mean no no they didn't circumcise me with a zipper
3456760	3462520	from his audition for there's something about Mary oh you you sliced yourself with a zipper
3462520	3467640	fuck I thought I've done that that's the fucking word and I was too I was like 12 or 13
3468760	3475320	yeah you scarred yourself yeah did you get stitches or shit no I told nobody
3477560	3483640	we're very repressed over there I went to actually I wasn't wearing this is the weird part of the
3483640	3489960	story I didn't wear underwear for way too long like I was maybe 13 when I started wearing
3489960	3499560	underwear I don't know I don't want to talk about it yeah yes you do but uh so I too much to contain
3499720	3504440	huh I yeah there's just a lot to contain let's go with that
3506680	3515480	and um I had just discovered uh masturbation and uh well I was like fucking so into it I was
3515480	3520520	telling you I was I was pretty fun I and when I was doing it it became this game like how quickly
3520520	3525640	can I do it you know so I would try and like go for the record so this was like I think the fourth
3525640	3529960	time I was doing it that way what is the record right now where does the record stand I don't
3529960	3537080	remember but I bet it's around like seven or eight seconds no no how many times in a day I've
3537080	3541480	masturbated oh I think I thought you're taking the record how quickly you could do it like oh yeah
3541480	3546520	but that was part of it too okay yeah if you're gonna do it eight times yeah I'm not here to you
3546520	3554600	know it's measured in blinks so uh yeah so I did it it was like the fourth time and we were going
3554680	3560120	to this theme park in Pakistan called fun land that was the name of it which seems like a real
3560120	3567880	like well on the first yeah little real first draft name you know fun land seems like a trap
3569720	3575880	trying to lure Americans yeah yeah like trying to get kids yeah fun land right yeah like fun
3575880	3579160	you think this is how you have fun you can just go to some land
3579160	3586840	uh so I was like classic I could get it before and I was going with my cousin I was like I could
3586840	3591000	get it before it's time to go so I was in there I was trying to go go go and my mom started yelling
3591000	3596440	at me it's time we have to go the car is leaving so that makes it harder than to come because I
3596440	3603480	could hear my mom yelling at me um so I finally like fucking threw sheer force of will very proud
3603480	3610200	that in these circumstances I could do it so I got it done and uh I just zipped through my pee
3613400	3618680	and it was jeans and I often didn't have underwear and I rode roller coasters all day
3621720	3628280	bleeding jeez yeah wow Camille Camille's comedy special is available on
3628600	3631320	I'm sorry you should make Camille a cake
3632840	3637720	zipper zipper dick can I get a penis that doesn't have a zipper scar on it
3637720	3642440	you can't Camille I I uh I shut my little brother's penis in a gate
3651080	3656440	so many questions when my little brother was in diapers and I was a few years
3656440	3660920	older than him I was a toddler I wanted to change his diaper to show my parents that
3660920	3669160	I could change his diaper and I yanked off his clean diaper and he was running away from me
3669160	3674520	and we had marble stairs and there was a baby gate at the top of the marble stairs that's
3674520	3681160	that's the name of the story it's called baby gate it was a little it was a little open and
3681160	3684520	he was running up to the stairs and I I was worried that he was going to fall down the stairs
3684520	3691880	and at the exact wrong moment I I shut the gate on his penis on his penis and he had to
3691880	3699160	get stitches oh that's terrible and he wiped it from his memory like we're really good friends
3699160	3707160	yeah we're good friends and a few years ago we both uh camp counseled at the same camp and like
3707160	3710600	at a campfire I was like well there was that time when I shot your penis and he's like what are you
3710600	3716920	talking about what are you he had no idea he went in the bathroom and looked at his completely crooked
3717960	3722360	that way it looks like a corkscrew yeah why is there a hinge imprint on it
3724120	3731080	all penises are an L right uh all right well I'm glad I'm glad we got to this place because
3731080	3735960	I think I felt like uh as my own worst critic I thought the show started kind of uh flat and

4257640	4263560	stuff out in the common area yeah like not like in plain view so people would come and watch but
4263560	4268920	I just you know just alone in the bathroom are you ever in a doorway no well yeah like when people
4268920	4274120	come up to you and go like hey Spencer talk about talk about that late bulb yeah stuff like that
4275560	4280360	that was a good thing with me too it's like do that freezer talk yeah exactly like it was just
4280360	4285480	kind of like talk smart about that bulletin board that's what it was just that I used to dance for
4285480	4295080	money wait all right let's play D&D no no no when we last met no for really yeah what can we
4295080	4301000	see a little dancing what okay what no no I want to have money could you uh could you uh smoke a
4301000	4311320	cigar with your butt come on Spencer let's see it this is this is an inside D&D reference
4312760	4317400	yeah fuck everybody who's expecting you to do it you would dance for money like people they would
4317400	4323880	go like at dances I know I write down on paper like I will dance for money and then I just be
4323880	4328280	talking with my friends and holding it and so I'd be like dance for money and I'd be like yeah sure
4328280	4334120	and then they'd give me a quarter and I'd just be like and then I'd stop and then sometimes they'd
4334120	4337960	be like well that wasn't enough and you know I'd be like whatever and then we did you ever did you
4337960	4344120	ever suffer any in high school did you did you feel like you were like uh bottom rung or I mean
4344120	4349960	I got made fun of some but um before being the guy who danced for money yeah I mean well just
4349960	4356360	everyone has antagonists and not like I wasn't like a lower lower lower beast I don't think I
4356360	4362360	think a lot of people like me yeah yeah you're pretty self-aware like a like a known guy around
4362360	4368600	the school yeah well it's like now you know everyone's like oh Spencer that guy just look
4368600	4374760	at him no one talks to me or anything but you know they know who I am all right that should that's
4374760	4378440	the next t-shirt are you becoming a little more extroverted now that you've moved to Hollywood
4378440	4383160	and you're you know like well we were just talking after the Harmon Quest thing um I was
4383240	4388760	there was that party and I was gonna go and I was like uh no like we were actually driving
4388760	4392760	there and we were getting off the freeway and I was like fuck this and then I just drove home
4393640	4399880	yeah so no no so you don't like big social situations I mean party specific parties are
4399880	4405480	weird because like unless you have interesting cool stuff to say all the time people just walk away
4406120	4411720	and um at a certain part at a certain part of the night like people cluster up in these little
4411720	4415720	groups like you know there's actually like a whole ethnology to like parties like you could
4415720	4425080	study and they're really interesting from the outside um but uh yeah there's those little
4425080	4429560	clustery groups that happen and I have no fucking idea because that's when most people are drunk
4429560	4435320	and people are being like in a minute be like I just don't know like it's just growing on my hip
4436200	4440680	like I just people are you know talking about their problems and and I'm not in one of those
4440680	4446920	clusters so I just like wander around and then I leave and then it's like they're talking about
4446920	4451320	something too serious yeah and then it's just weird yeah you don't want to walk in you feel
4451320	4454760	yeah you're fucking it up because you're not a you're not a big drinker right so it's gotta be
4454760	4458600	yeah those people gotta seem like assholes when you walk up to that big group and they're like
4458600	4465880	oh but rice krispies no well I feel like the asshole no but yeah there's like the mystical
4465880	4472680	like a really sincere moment between spencer and I who I I like you so much like spencer
4472680	4478920	spencer really is like legitimately the coolest person ever he's so fun to talk to and so nice
4478920	4480120	and so you haven't cleaned your pool
4485320	4486920	so handsome and so strong
4487640	4496440	um there's there's a point during the hermiton tour like after like a few uh informal bonding
4496440	4501640	sessions that spencer and I had where he asked me legitimately like we're is this friendship
4501640	4508040	just because you were drunk when we were talking or is it uh is it a real friendship like is this
4508040	4513560	just you being drunk and being nice to me well drunk people talk well that's it drunk people talk
4513720	4520280	they you can't stop them well yeah if we were all sober all the time then we'd never talk
4520280	4526280	no one would just be talking about the ethnology of parties yeah somebody's got to do the heroic
4526280	4531240	move of getting sloppy and like talking about rice krispies in a big glob of land the other
4531240	4536200	night when I was drunk told uh vet Nicole Brown that I'd really like to see her in a black rom-com
4536200	4543880	and it would not stop talking about it I have to send her an email I really over and over again
4543880	4550200	I was like play I love black ram like it's creepy for me I said well it's good you know it's like
4550200	4555560	fire it can it has its uses and it can burn all right spencer shall we get this underway
4556360	4564760	why why are we okay I think everyone's fine when we last met our heroes were on the road to
4564760	4573880	fornheim the frozen city but the road was less of a road and more of a bridge an ice bridge to be
4573880	4580600	more specific to be even more specific it was an ice bridge guarded by skeleton warriors wielding
4580600	4586360	icy blades after a vicious and deadly combat quark wrestled one off the cliff while sharpie
4586360	4592360	and mole rain teamed up and destroyed the other two and after defeating their foes a voice called
4592360	4600280	out from within welcome to fornheim the frozen city what they found inside was not dwarves like
4600280	4605960	sharpie had expected but rather frost giants great blue-skinned humanoids living and talking
4605960	4611720	laughing and working in their giant city after chanting with the are chatting with the most kind
4611720	4617960	faced of the giants the gang was told to follow a group of skeletons directly towards the yarl
4617960	4624360	who was the leader of fornheim and so our series our heroes went after the skeletons and met with
4624360	4632040	the yarl the yarl was most kind and was willing to help the party but for a price all of their
4632040	4638360	fragments of power but with so much writing on the line in their fight against admiral darkstar
4638360	4645080	would they really be willing to pay such a price in defeat admiral darkstar in his black keep
4645640	4648360	we'll find out next
4657480	4663720	yeah i can't and we're having a sidebar here the yarl can't hear us okay yeah i don't know i mean
4663720	4669000	the shards of power it's like the ring of power in the middle earth yeah the wrong hands like in
4669000	4673240	the wrong hands that's bad we don't want it it doesn't do anybody any good for anybody to have
4673240	4679880	all of them yeah i'm assuming mm-hmm this guy's pretty powerful to begin with maybe i should just
4679880	4686760	talk to him go ahead all right well but wait let me do this i kind of straighten her hair and i
4686760	4695640	unbutton the button on her uh tunic uh i don't know what my reaction to that would be is stop
4695640	4704200	touching my hair the yarl is just looking at you what is happening i mean we were lovers at
4704200	4712360	a point at a time maybe i you don't remember we fucked under her horse oh yeah we fucked under
4712360	4719320	your horse yeah i got i got that is the last voice that i wanted to say that you fucked under a horse
4719320	4730040	were you drawing that i have three dnd games going in my life yeah uh sorry go ahead well go
4730040	4738200	go talk to the giant what are you gonna say all right i'll talk to him yarl oh okay cool hey
4739480	4747080	yarl we have the same interest you do keeping the earth from the clutches of admiral darkstar i'm
4747080	4754280	there too are we supposed to do it together all right i'll jump in too
4757960	4763800	however we can't leave all the shards of power in the hands of
4768120	4772200	i i'm off to the side doing the wayne brady improv game of doing sign language like uh
4772200	4783480	these shards of power are things we might actually need to defeat admiral darkstar
4785240	4792360	not only that but you not only that i mean i mean i guess what i'm saying is i guess what we're
4792360	4807800	saying is is if your requirement i walk over to wane brady if your requirement to help us required
4807800	4815160	to help us is your own self-interest then it's not called helping it's called called buying buying
4817000	4821720	this we're here rounding up volunteers people who are willing to sacrifice
4821720	4828120	for the goodness of the earth not people who are looking to make out uh uh uh like bandits
4828120	4837320	that's admiral darkstar he's the one who wants to take we want to give but not to you good is for sale
4838440	4849720	the right thing is for i think we should sell sale he he finds it really hard to understand
4852440	4858840	what the hell you guys are trying to say no shards of power zero shards of power for giants
4859720	4866440	okay here's what here's our offer help us or perish oh no
4868120	4875880	no no wait wait wait wait wait disregard that sidebar perish are we threatening them
4876680	4882360	you don't come in with the cosmetic figure with these guys you know while this was happening
4882360	4888360	while i was chiming in i was i was uh transcribing everything he was saying and i i write it on my
4888360	4897160	water skin and i offer it up to him and i i do a little i do a little wink you're waiting for you
4897160	4903800	to do it not by our hands we know that your might is the most mighty we know you could step on us
4903800	4909960	like insects yeah i was also gonna point that out but i'm gonna tell you something that i heard
4909960	4918200	in the 60s in brooklyn i thought that i could step on people uh because they were like insects
4918200	4923160	and then someone came and stepped on me because they were like giant insects and then i realized
4923160	4927960	that i was the insect giant yeah that's the situation you find yourself in sure may it
4927960	4932760	and it's the situation you'll find yourself in can i finish no why i would just like to
4932760	4942440	interject quickly so i guess the answer is no i mean what what an amazing thing to be so much

4948200	4955720	mean wow uh you you are in this position where where you have all this responsibility to be so
