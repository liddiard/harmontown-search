0	20880	Ladies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session.
20880	21880	Welcome one and all.
21880	25040	Thank you so much for coming down here to Nerd Mount Theater in Hollywood, California.
25040	29960	And thank you to all you beautiful weirdos listening on the podcast universe.
30080	33840	Please join me in welcoming the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.
53120	53560	Thank you.
54440	59760	Um, tonight I'd like to complain a lot, uh, just in one of those moods.
59760	63960	I, I, I have a lot of things I'd like to complain about and they're actually, I've
63960	68240	categorized them all specifically because complaining isn't charismatic ever.
68240	72800	You could complain even if you had one leg and if you complained about it too
72800	76120	much, people secretly behind your back would be like, we won't shut the fuck up
76120	79200	about, it's like, just fucking own it, man.
79320	82480	But the guy with one leg that comes in and goes like, Hey, let's hop to it.
82480	84120	And everyone's like Leonard owns it.
84160	88040	He loves, you know, we don't like complaining primatologically.
88040	89560	It's not an attractive feature.
89560	94320	It doesn't, it's a strangely enough, it seems to have been selected very highly
94320	97720	in our species, because we all complain a lot, but it doesn't, it doesn't seem to
97720	100400	turn anybody on, uh, audiences don't like it.
100560	104920	And especially in my situation, I find I have a lot of things, uh, to complain
104920	109000	about, so I want to, I want to start a new feature, a new Harmontown feature.
109000	112920	Cause people in podcasts, they like, uh, they like like little categories and
112920	114840	features, little desk bits.
114840	120640	So I thought in the green room, we call this feature things I am afraid to complain
120640	124640	about because it'll make me sound like a, a, a, an asshole.
124760	128000	Things, Dan's afraid to complain about things.
128000	129280	Dan's afraid to complain.
129600	130120	Where's the music?
132760	133120	Yeah.
135240	138280	I mean, here's a classic example, just to start you, start you off.
138400	139400	What do you mean, Dan?
139400	141040	What kind of complaint could make you sound like an asshole?
141040	142560	Doesn't every complaint make you sound like an asshole?
142720	144840	No, I complain about lots of stuff all the time.
145040	146840	This show is very hard to do, by the way.
146840	148520	I, I, it's hard to come down here.
148800	151080	Uh, you think you're a small audience.
151080	152200	I have a small heart.
153640	157680	Uh, but here's a real, he's a real humdinger.
157720	159520	I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to lead big.
159520	161600	Dan's afraid about number one.
164040	166200	My Gartner is doing something wrong.
169280	170280	I'm not finished.
171480	175680	I can't put my finger on it, uh, but my decorator agrees.
176880	177960	He backed me up on it.
177960	184080	He was leaving the guy, my decorator, uh, looked at my front lawn and said, your
184080	185600	Gartner is doing something wrong.
186080	187040	And I agree.
187880	189360	I said, Kurt, you're right.
189520	191160	Is your decorator Greek?
191280	194080	Uh, he's a, or gay.
194200	197760	Uh, did I make him say, I made him say, you made him, yeah.
197880	199280	You did a gay character.
199320	201600	Yeah, I did a, well, he is a gay character.
201960	205680	I don't, I don't, I don't think he would deny that he's a decorator.
205720	208160	If he's straight, he's required to act gay.
208160	212080	If he wants business, like he's, he buys pillows for a living.
212120	213920	He, he, he knows where his bread's buttered.
213920	215720	Do you think that's a possibility that he's faking?
215840	221280	Uh, I think the pressures are on, uh, I could imagine for real, like, even though
221280	224960	that seems like sitcom kind of fodder, truthfully, if you were in the decorating
224960	230040	business, I could picture the pressure being on you, uh, the, the, the feeling
230040	233440	of disappointment from the rich people that, that answer the front door.
233440	237680	And you're like, Hey, Carl, uh, I had to drop my wife off for that.
237680	238160	Yeah.
241520	242000	I don't know.
242040	244400	I think, I think there's probably pressure on him.
244400	246080	He could be straight as an arrow.
246840	248520	Uh, that doesn't matter though.
248520	249840	I have no complaints about that.
250040	255520	I, I have a complaint about the fact that, uh, the person who, whose job it is to
255520	260640	water and, uh, I'm not even sure what his job is, uh, but he's doing something wrong.
261080	262800	The plants feel lifeless.
263280	265800	And I'm not allowed to complain about that for obvious reasons.
266080	267120	You guys don't have gardeners.
268680	270400	Your, your, your buildings have gardeners.
270960	275120	My building at a gardener ever said, you know, my first book, but then you, then
275120	276680	when you own a home, you have a gardener.
276680	280080	If you're going to commit to the archetype of rich guy complaining about
280080	282600	gardeners, I would say, I would say commit.
282720	283000	Yeah.
283040	283480	I'm committed.
283480	284120	I'm committed to it.
284120	285720	I'm, so I'm bringing out the worst.
285720	286880	These are the worst things.
287080	289440	I don't want you liking me after this feature is done.
289680	294800	If you did going in, I want you to go, Jesus, what gardener decorator go fuck
294800	296280	yours and complaining about it.
296880	297720	Fuck you.
297760	299520	That's what I'm getting off of my chest.
299960	304040	Um, so the plants, I don't, the plants feel lifeless outside.
304080	304320	Yeah.
304320	304640	I don't know.
304640	305880	Something's going wrong out there.
305880	308360	And really if the decorator hadn't said anything, I don't think I would have
308360	313760	noticed, uh, he's gay.
313760	314240	All right.
314600	315440	Here's the next one.
316240	318000	I don't like people trying to help me.
319360	320360	That's a short one.
320640	323720	Like I says the guy who has a gardener and a decorator.
326240	328720	I don't, Jeff, if that's where you're going, this is going to
328720	330000	be a bunch of slam dunks.
330000	332520	Like I, I, I don't, I, that's not.
333520	335880	Oh, sorry.
336200	337440	Are you one step ahead of me on that one?
337440	337800	I'm sorry.
337840	340800	Well, I mean, this is the headline on this thing.
340800	343120	Is that I will withhold my witty bone molds?
343120	349000	Well, I mean, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a dick as that's the point of the whole thing.
349080	349440	All right.
349480	351160	Do it, do whatever you want, Jeff.
351200	353480	Just, uh, thank you for not trying to help me.
355240	360800	I don't like, like, like, like, uh, I, I went outside my house today and there was
360800	364200	a, some kind of, uh, sewer emergency happening.
364200	367360	There was a yellow truck and there were two people and Dickies and they were,
367600	371800	they were putting pitchforks down the hall and, uh, and, and tubes and stuff.
371800	374800	Dickies like the fake turtlenecks or what are they called?
374800	378000	There's no, isn't that, isn't Dickies also the name of the fucking, uh, what
378000	381280	are those called those, you know, this kind of industrial kind of coverall shirts.
381360	382200	Yeah, they're called Dickies.
382200	382600	Thank you.
383080	387680	So they are sticking sticks down the hall.
387680	389560	I don't know if there was an alligator missing or something.
390280	391640	They had little cones set up.
392120	393400	We have a missing alligator.
394720	395240	Go out there.
395240	398800	We got to go to each manhole one by one and poke down it.
398800	403440	And if an alligator, if it comes back, bit off like a cartoon, then we know we found
403440	404080	the right manhole.
404080	406720	Then we got to figure out how to get that alligator back to its owner.
407240	408880	He responds to the name Twinkie.
410520	412360	Uh, so they're out there.
412360	412920	They got cones.
412960	414360	I long story short.
414360	417240	I don't think King Harmon is going to be able to get out of his garage.
417320	419160	Uh, and I, uh, King Harmon.
419200	421840	Yeah, that's like just called myself King Harmon.
421960	422880	It's my garage.
422880	424760	It's my, my, my street.
424960	425800	They're in front of it.
425800	427160	They're poking sticks down a hole.
427320	430280	I went up to them and said, uh, good morning.
430600	432600	Uh, I'll be coming through here.
432680	434680	Uh, do you think I'll fit?
434720	436280	And, uh, they're like, yeah, you will.
436280	437040	Yeah, fine.
437560	442280	And so I go book to my car and, uh, Erin McGathey, uh, gets on the other side.
442320	443520	She spent the night.
445120	448240	I think, I think, uh, I think it's going somewhere.
449160	453920	Did you guys, uh, I think if I know what you mean.
453920	456360	Yes, I did play fallout new Vegas all night.
458120	459800	Yes, I did.
461240	466320	Let's just say in hardcore mode, which is really cool by the way.
466320	469160	Has anybody ever had fallout fallout new Vegas fans here?
469160	470960	It's a accident.
470960	474400	I made brief eye contact with a one of our few women in the audience.
474640	478560	I projected shame onto your face when I, I know, I know.
478560	480120	You're just all, you're doing nothing wrong.
480120	482160	You're just staring forward, like looking and listening.
482280	486040	But I, as I was ass pulling any video game, people are like, Oh God, girls,
487440	489880	which is silly because there's lots of girls and I'm sure they all like video
489880	490360	games. It's me.
490360	490720	That's me.
490760	495000	That's the one, two punch of sexism and then reverse self loathing.
495000	497960	Like what is that's what, that's what nerd men do to women.
498240	505520	It's the glass floor with spikes on it in the bottom of the hobby shop.
506520	511480	Not very, not very kingly, not very king, not befitting a king.
511480	517560	So, so I get in my car and I back out and then the, and the guy, he gets behind
517560	523080	the car, he gets between the car and his poop truck and, and he's, I can see him
523800	528280	gesticulating, I know I, he looked like it was tossing a pizza.
528280	530920	Like I, that's not racist because he wasn't Italian.
532120	534640	It just, it just, that's how I would describe what he was doing.
534920	537680	And just like, oh, Luigi, I want the mode of pizza.
537960	541520	Like, like just like shaking his hands like a Muppet, you know, like, like he had
541520	544040	sticks on his elbows and it was someone's birthday.
544040	544760	That's all I saw.
545840	550400	And I, I, I'm like, I'm going to do whatever I was going to do.
550440	555240	Like, like I, my goal isn't to back my car into your poop truck.
555440	556840	I think that's the one thing I know is there.
556840	561600	I came over, said good morning to the poop truck driver and said, I'm coming out.
561720	562920	He doesn't need, I don't know.
562920	565200	He's standing between my car and the thing.
565200	565920	He doesn't want me to hit.
565920	570680	All he's doing is making me have less space to do my, my very difficult
570680	571800	why turn around a poop truck.
572000	573400	And I was complaining about it the whole time.
573400	574720	And Aaron said, he's trying to help you.
574720	576640	And I, I, I don't care.
576680	578280	I, that's what I didn't like about him.
578280	579000	He tried to help me.
579080	579760	I don't like it.
580280	584360	And, and, uh, yeah, and, and, uh, yeah, I don't like him.
585560	587040	I don't have to say anywhere about that.
587040	589840	I resent, I resent the amount that he's been in my life already.
590560	591320	I want him out.
591360	594240	There are times when people try to help you and, uh, they get in the way.
594280	598400	Like that, that guy was making it harder for you to do, uh, the inevitable.
598440	599120	Next item.
600000	603280	Everyone should have to wear name tags, uh, every, all the time.
603280	604200	Just wear name tags.
604200	606160	That's the last time I was ever happy was in kindergarten.
606160	611680	Everyone had a Kool-Aid lid around their neck with yarn and it had their name on it.
611920	618200	And, and I'm sorry, uh, and I, and I don't, I, I, I, I, I, I have to walk a tight
618200	623520	rope here because what I want to say first of all is I wish I could say these
623520	624840	two things at the same time.
624840	630240	But the first thing I want to say is if your name's Dave and, and I like what,
630240	635040	you're not a lion tamer, like, like, what, what, you don't have a hat that says Dave
635040	636360	on it, your name's Dave.
636520	638880	It's like one of eight names that we have.
638920	640480	It's just, it's nothing wrong with it.
640480	643400	My name's Dan, but I can't shout.
643440	646560	So here's the thing I wish I could say at the same time as that, because it
646560	648840	sounds like I'm bullying guys with unremarkable names.
649080	654040	Uh, uh, I also don't, I don't want you to be named Xander or any, or, or, or
654040	659320	Ginger root or a fucking safari with two R's and a, and a T.
659560	662320	I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't like that either.
662320	663720	I don't like, I don't like you.
663720	664560	I don't like people.
664560	667480	I don't, I don't, your, your names are, are not words.
667480	669160	They, they should be like everyone.
669160	672000	If you fought a bear when you were a kid, your name should be fought a bear.
672000	677760	And I think we know we had a chance at that society and, uh, someone fucked it up.
678480	683440	Uh, what, what would your, what would your, uh, given Indian name be?
683440	686800	If you were a native, if you were a Cherokee or a Navajo.
687120	689120	You know, I liked the idea of it not being up to me.
689120	691960	I mean, that's a lot of pressure I put on a guy because then everyone's name
691960	700400	would be like struggles under the burden of his own dick, like weakens in the
700400	704880	knees when he pees and, uh, people would be just doing bits, you know, like, like,
704880	715240	like constantly the target of jealousy among eagles, uh, you know, comes, comes a river.
715600	717480	Come, comes a river.
718240	723760	Uh, let's say, use your, use your imagination as a, as a, as a gifted writer.
723760	725120	Sick TP owner.
725840	731280	Uh, pretend you're the village and there's an eight-year-old Dan Harmon walking around.
731280	735480	What do you think, please, uh, poops his pants.
735520	735920	I don't know.
735920	738840	It's a dirty, dirty, dirty face.
739720	740600	I was very dirty.
740600	744520	I would play under the stairs and stuff, but maybe on the prairie,
744520	746000	maybe I was longing for the prairie.
746040	747720	Well, there was no, there was no stairs there.
747920	748880	I think I am.
748920	753360	I'm, I'm a little part native American, uh, in the sense that one of my dad's eight,
753400	756120	uh, dad's, uh, uh, was, uh,
756120	757080	Your dad had eight dads?
757120	757360	Yeah.
757360	758760	Well, he's passed around a lot.
758800	762960	Uh, so it's not a biological connection, but sometimes I feel the nature calling
762960	772600	me, uh, cause one of the guys that, that hit my grandma, uh, was, uh, a hundred
772600	773880	percent Choctaw.
776840	777400	I feel it.
777880	781400	Sometimes I, like when I drive past a gas station, I'm like, I want to get, I
781400	784480	want to get some lucky strikes and, and, and wear more denim.
786920	788200	If you had, I want a Jeep.
788760	791880	If you, if you had, if you were the chief of a tribe and, uh, you know, cause you
791880	793640	kind of are, you're the mayor of Harmon town.
793640	794960	It's similar King Harmon.
794960	795520	King Harmon.
795520	799080	Uh, how would you, would you give an Indian name to your girlfriend, Aaron?
799880	800680	What would that be?
800920	804560	Uh, uh, uh, uh, grips like a vice.
804560	804800	What?
807360	809440	What am I, what am I supposed to know?
809880	811960	When did comp trolling become instigating?
814400	815440	I'm not trying to provoke you.
815440	819720	I'm saying like, you could have said, uh, you know, uh, uh, uh, chases clouds away.
819760	824400	You could have said, you made it dirty.
825840	827840	Strawberry head.
831680	832720	Strawberry head.
832720	833680	That's what I call her.
833680	835280	And I'd be a little cloud baby.
835320	839720	Aaron, uh, Aaron, you're off mic, but what would your Indian name be for Dan?
840960	841680	You can think about that.
841680	842160	You can come back.
842160	844880	Yeah, we'll come back to you when you, when you've got it, raise your hand.
844880	846120	And we'll, we'll, we'll mic you up.
847520	848800	We'll send a guy out with a lav.
849960	850360	All right.
850680	853120	Um, moving on the segments working.
853240	856480	I'm getting, I feel toothbrushes in hotel rooms and tooth, more
856480	858760	importantly, toothpaste, I'll bring the toothbrush as long as you don't
858760	863520	outlaw that, uh, TSA, which is a private company, not a fucking government agency.
863640	866120	Fucking lose people, uh, at the goddamn airport.
866320	869160	And, uh, by the way, I'm not going to leave the charge, but let's all opt
869160	871000	out of the fucking scatterback machines.
871240	872920	Uh, they, they make me dizzy.
873280	875000	Uh, they, they make me nauseous.
875040	876160	Something's going wrong.
876200	877240	I'm sure it's an urban.
877520	880840	We went, we went through an airport with Dino and Dino was like in line.
880840	884960	And he said like, you know, the guy who invented that thing won't go through it.
886920	891920	And, and, and, and like, he didn't say it, he said it louder than, than I'm
891960	893440	comfortable saying anything in an airport.
893440	897880	But he, uh, uh, but, but he didn't say it like, but, but you could tell that they
897880	902960	were like, they, they, they were, they were, and I don't know that it's true.
902960	906720	I just know that they reacted to their, their, their, their sick of hearing about
906720	913280	that little, little, little, little nub, uh, little edit, uh, and, and also look
913280	916400	up synonyms for, uh, moments, I don't know.
916880	918880	And patch it in later with a voice synthesizer.
919280	920920	I got to keep moving, man.
921640	923440	I don't want to get on a lot of tangents tonight.
923760	927280	That's, that's my new, that's my Jack Benny, like catchphrase.
929360	930640	Did Jack Benny have a catchphrase?
931080	932480	Uh, what does this say?
932480	934120	He, he, he, he, the physical thing.
934120	934360	Yeah.
934360	938520	It was like, but he started on the radio.
938560	941640	I mean, so he must've had the verbal equivalent of doing that.
941640	943240	Like my, oh my.
943320	946600	Oh, Rochester heavens to Mercatroyd.
947360	948760	That was, that was snaggle puss.
948800	949080	Yeah.
950080	956000	Uh, toothpaste, toothpaste in hotel rooms.
956040	959960	You're not allowed to bring toothpaste on the plane hotels.
960160	964360	Your whole, like you're in the business of trying to anticipate
964360	965320	what your guests want.
965640	968120	You, we know you have toothpaste.
968120	971400	The cat is out of the bag because every time we call down to the front desk
971400	973080	and ask for it, you have it.
973080	974800	You have a box of toothpaste.
974960	978840	You just don't want to put it in the room because some people might not
978840	983680	use it and you're going to get rich one nickel at a time.
984040	985400	I, unbelievable.
985400	987320	You have a hotel chain.
987760	991120	Did you make it out of empty toothpaste containers?
991520	995040	Did you, did you, did you use the money to build the 13th floor that
995040	997360	you saved on in toothpaste?
997360	1001560	Like there's, there's leftover change somewhere in the hotel business.
1001880	1003440	A little packet of toothpaste.
1003600	1005760	You don't make us call down for soap.
1006360	1008520	N words.
1011760	1013160	I may have mentioned this before.
1013160	1016080	I have a real problem with the, uh, housekeepers.
1016600	1020320	It's not, they didn't invent this, the, the, the women and mostly women,
1020320	1024080	but probably some men that, that are the housekeepers in the hotels around the
1024080	1028720	world, they didn't invent this, but apparently there's a bit of a rule,
1028720	1031960	a mandate that they must fold all Kleenex and all toilet paper into
1031960	1037600	that neat little V thing to make it easier to use, like the first sheets
1037600	1042160	set up for you, man, or sometimes your next shits on us or they'll take the
1042160	1044720	first three Kleenex and fold it into some kind of rosette.
1044960	1046520	I was like, that doesn't say fancy.
1046520	1048080	That says previously handled.
1048120	1048560	Yeah.
1048840	1049160	All right.
1049240	1049520	All right.
1049520	1050880	Now, now we're getting into this.
1050920	1052080	Maybe we'll bring some of you up here.
1052160	1056520	I always say, uh, little less touching on the toilet paper and the Kleenex.
1056560	1059120	We got, I, I, I'm going to put this in my nose in a moment.
1059320	1063000	Why, why do I want your, you, you clean bathrooms for a little bit.
1065120	1069000	The title of this episode will be, I'm mad as hell for no real good reason.
1069000	1074600	And, and I am going to take it big, but I'm going to keep complaining anyway.
1075320	1078200	Uh, uh, uh, my bathtub doesn't work.
1078200	1079760	The one that would shoot water up my butt.
1079800	1082600	I, I, I broke it, I guess by loving it.
1082800	1088440	And, uh, uh, and, and, and, and, and the motor burnt out and I don't know who
1088440	1090920	installed this thing, but nobody can find the motor.
1091120	1093440	And, uh, I'm going to complain about my contractor too.
1093440	1095320	He's, he can't find my bathtub's motor.
1095520	1099040	Uh, he's, uh, he's punching holes in walls and then he's going, nope,
1099040	1099800	it's not in there.
1099800	1101760	And there's like three holes.
1101760	1102640	He can't find the motor.
1102640	1104600	I'm mad at the guy that invented the motor.
1104600	1106000	I'm mad at the guy that installed it.
1106000	1107080	I'm mad at the contractor.
1107080	1111280	I'm mad at these, these two old German people that I bought this house from.
1111280	1115920	And they ran down the driveway, uh, sniggering and chuckling about, about
1115920	1119440	there, counting my money because they knew that fucking bathtub was going to break.
1120000	1123280	I have to say that there's, there's, there's, there was a Dan Harmon that moved
1123280	1127160	into that house and there was this big bubble bath and used to get in the bubble
1127160	1130360	bath because Dan, not, not famous for bathing, right?
1130400	1132200	Uh, all of a sudden became Mr.
1132200	1136200	Bubble Bath and, uh, he was, he was, uh, he was up to his, uh, up to his tits and
1136200	1140160	lather for the, for the first few months and shooting a water jet out of the side
1140160	1144360	of the thing up his asshole, uh, jerking off to heaven knows what.
1144560	1148920	And, and, and you were, you were happy as a pig and shit for a long time.
1149000	1151040	That's when you know, you know how happy I was.
1151160	1152560	I didn't have to jerk off to anything.
1152640	1153640	Cause that's your big question.
1153680	1154760	What do you, what do you take?
1154760	1157400	You take your iPad in there and you put it in a plastic bag case it falls in.
1157400	1160240	What, yeah, this doesn't sound, what do you, what do you, what are you looking at?
1160640	1162000	It's so fun.
1162040	1162520	Nothing.
1162520	1163400	I'm not looking at anything.
1163400	1164720	I was in a little rave.
1164760	1169440	I was, uh, I was just dancing and maybe I'd put on some music.
1169440	1173240	Maybe like, uh, you had this, you had the jet going up the booty and, uh,
1175000	1176400	I'm, I'm doing the moves.
1176440	1178920	You're covered in suds and then the thing broke and you've
1178920	1180360	become an irascible asshole.
1180400	1182160	I fucking, I'm angry at that's what it is.
1182160	1183160	I'm glad we figured this out.
1183160	1185160	This is why it's important to talk to people.
1185200	1185800	Well, fix that.
1186560	1190040	I said the moment you fix that motor, we're going to, we're going to know the difference.
1190200	1190520	All right.
1190520	1196160	So, uh, uh, uh, at the, uh, at the, uh, uh, airport, okay.
1197040	1202320	Uh, at the airport, these bars that you go to in the airport, remember you guys
1202320	1204760	don't remember there's a, there's a culture to this.
1204760	1209960	The idea when you would go to the airport, the idea was they had bars at the airport
1210560	1216080	and it was a judgment free zone because you might be flying in across the world.
1216160	1220000	Like, you don't know, like, Oh, it's, uh, it, what's at six a.m.
1220000	1223000	I'll have a margarita cause I'm from Australia.
1223000	1224440	I'm selling socks down there.
1224440	1225800	And to me it's 2 p.m.
1225800	1229200	Or, you know, like you didn't, so the airport was like this, the idea of an
1229200	1232680	airport bar, it was supposed to be a better bar than a regular bar.
1232680	1235600	It was a bar where, where you could, you know, you were floating through.
1235600	1238400	It was like most isolate, you know, hammerhead could be there.
1238400	1242760	And, and, and, you know, you talk to a guy that distributes, uh, you know, parts
1242760	1246480	for machines and stuff from the blasters and then you get, you get so drunk because
1246480	1248600	you're all you're going to do is get on a plane and maybe die.
1248640	1250960	So you're everyone, you get drunk.
1250960	1254280	And it's like, it's like, it's the one fun thing about, about stuffing yourself
1254280	1261280	into a metal tube and being like bossed around by some of the, like the least
1261280	1266280	remarkable people, like I just, the anxiety level, the idea that you could
1266280	1271480	die on one of those things that's safer than, uh, than a car, I don't care.
1271480	1274160	It's like, like, I want to die in a car.
1274160	1277000	I don't, I should probably knock on some kind of wood.
1277280	1281560	Uh, I just like, like, like my hands are on the wheel or at least I'm in the thing.
1281560	1281880	I don't know.
1281880	1282920	I see what hits me.
1282920	1285400	I would much rather die in a plane crash than in a car wreck.
1285400	1289920	If I'm going down, I want to, I want to be a participant.
1289960	1293480	That's like, I want to be in that roller coaster and go, Jesus Christ, this is it.
1293680	1298240	That's like, that's like, uh, that's, that's like, that's like getting shot at a DMV.
1298520	1305280	Like the last thing you see as threshold guardians feel like you know, at 350 miles
1305280	1306640	an hour though, that's fun.
1309480	1311160	It's going to be awesome to die in a plane crash.
1311720	1315520	A car wreck is in a movie where they like this, there's always that act two bullshit
1315520	1319040	where some like happy couples backing out of the driveway and like, all right, I see
1319040	1321040	this, I could smash and some truck drives them over.
1321160	1324280	That's the, I hate anybody that writes a movie with that scene.
1324280	1325480	And I'm going to punch in the dick.
1325560	1325960	All right.
1325960	1327840	Well, Hey, listen, man.
1327880	1329720	Uh, what kind of rice?
1332400	1333360	Uh, at my wedding.
1333800	1334280	Yeah.
1334280	1336360	You're wedding to getting in plane crashes.
1338960	1339960	Uh, that's a new thing.
1341200	1342280	That's a new thing.
1342440	1344600	It's a, it's called, I call it a chain zinger.
1345200	1348560	You, you, you ask somebody a nonsensical question and you string them
1348560	1352240	along into your zinger, but sometimes you can, you can chain them real long.
1352240	1354200	You know, I could, I did it wrong.
1354200	1354600	Do it again.
1354600	1358760	So I go, I think that anyone that writes a, uh, that sneak attack car crash in a
1358760	1360640	movie should be punched in the dick.
1360880	1363240	Hey, listen, uh, was there a fine involved?
1363520	1364040	For what?
1364120	1371120	For, well, did, uh, did the, uh, ASPCA, uh, fine you, uh, for, for doing what?
1371160	1374040	Well, cause all of those, didn't all the pigeons like explode and stuff?
1375440	1376400	Do the pigeons explode?
1376440	1379200	Well, cause the rice, although I thought they eat rice and then they explode
1379200	1380120	like when they're at a wedding.
1381280	1383680	Wait, I was talking about car crashes and plane crashes.
1383680	1386640	And I thought you were going to marry getting in fucking plane crashes.
1388640	1390600	You won't shut the fuck up about it.
1390720	1399560	Well, our next guest, chain zinger, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron insists on calling
1399560	1404560	them what kind of rices, which is easier to remember, but it's not going to take
1404560	1404880	off.
1404880	1406440	I'm not going to sell that paperback.
1406440	1409360	You know, I want to Harris Whittle's career here.
1409360	1412440	I want to, I want to, I want a humble brag book on every table.
1412680	1417240	Uh, can we talk about your brother's, uh, bucks, uh, the doll hairs thing?
1417920	1418320	Oh yeah.
1418320	1425840	My brother, my brother, I don't know how many of you are longtime, uh, listeners,
1425840	1431240	but, uh, his brother bones, uh, he's a, he's a recurring character on the show.
1431480	1432320	Well, not anymore.
1432320	1434000	Cause I read some of his emails.
1434000	1436000	I had Adam read some of his emails.
1436360	1439880	Um, and he was very, I, I, I understand completely.
1439880	1443160	I, I'm not going to, I'm not complaining about my brother being offended by what I,
1443200	1444880	what I, how I talk about him.
1445480	1448280	Um, cause I, my goal is to make fun of him when I talk about him.
1448280	1451560	Like I, I, I'm, I'm squeezing him like a sponge.
1451560	1454280	I'm trying to get joy for other people out of him.
1454400	1456560	Like, I don't, I don't, he's had enough.
1456840	1460080	Like, uh, he doesn't, he doesn't get any more from me.
1460080	1462000	I want something from him.
1462280	1463960	Uh, and, uh, he's my big brother.
1463960	1464840	So you get to think about him.
1464960	1468680	I challenge him to fly out from wherever he is to come to Hollywood,
1468680	1472720	California and be on the show, live on stage.
1473000	1473480	Everybody.
1475720	1477240	You hear that bones, you pussy.
1478200	1479080	They're calling you out.
1480280	1481800	They're calling you out, you pussy.
1481800	1484920	He can, he can stay at your place, man.
1488160	1491720	I got a couch and maybe he'll try to convince you.
1491720	1493320	He invented peanut butter and jelly.
1495480	1495960	Yeah.
1496000	1496320	Yeah.
1496320	1496840	No.
1496880	1497280	Yeah.
1497320	1499200	That was, I mean, that's, that's standard.
1499200	1500880	I get to tell people about that.
1501160	1502480	He doesn't get to be mad.
1502480	1506240	If I, if your brother tries to convince you, he invented peanut butter and jelly
1506240	1510400	when your kids, when you're 39 and you tell people about that, like he,
1510400	1511480	he doesn't get to be mad.
1511560	1511960	Whatever.
1511960	1512920	He can be as mad as he wants.
1512960	1513480	I don't care.
1513480	1516200	That's, that's adorable big brother, you know, stuff.
1516280	1516480	Yeah.
1516480	1517160	You get to do that.
1517200	1517760	Anyways.
1517760	1518840	Why, why'd we bring him up?
1518840	1519040	What?
1519080	1520080	Oh, doll hairs.
1520120	1522000	One time, you know, that doll hairs thing.
1522000	1523840	I go like, Hey, I'll give you $20.
1523840	1527560	If you, uh, if you run into the traffic and then the, you know, the little brother
1527560	1530640	does it and then the big brother says, uh, I said doll hairs.
1531680	1535320	Um, so my brother did that to me once and I was like, okay, all right.
1535560	1537440	You know, my brain grew a little bit.
1537440	1538840	I was like, all right.
1539920	1540800	Note to self.
1540800	1543680	Like, uh, we'll keep a little leprechaun file.
1543680	1549080	If, uh, if it seems too good to be true, dot, dot, dot, uh, and all that, uh, add a
1549080	1553520	little serotonin connection to the concept of currency and possible word play.
1553720	1558960	Uh, and so one time he said, like, I don't remember what the dare was.
1558960	1562280	Like, go jump over that, that prickly plant or something stupid.
1562280	1562760	Like, what are we?
1562760	1563520	Braille rabbit.
1563560	1567640	Uh, I, he said, I'll give you, I'll give you a hundred bucks.
1568360	1571680	And I said, and I was a little precocious little, little kids.
1571680	1573040	I went, yeah, right.
1573240	1575560	I know that means male deer.
1576160	1580200	Like, like he's going to give me a hundred male deer, but I was, I was running
1580200	1582400	through, I was like, okay, let's, you know, let's figure this out.
1582400	1584600	In the old West, I would have been worth like $5,000.
1584600	1587280	And he said, he said, no, I'm not going to give you male deer.
1587280	1588160	I said bucks.
1588160	1589480	I'm going to give you a hundred bucks.
1589640	1593160	And I was like, okay, bucks, bucks, bucks, then nothing, nothing like, okay.
1593160	1595760	And I jumped over the thing, whatever it was.
1596000	1600760	And then he, he grabbed me and, and he kind of started humping me and
1600760	1604000	said, uh, bucks is short for butt fucks.
1615360	1619120	Now, if he, if he heard me telling that story, he'd, he'd get apparently
1619120	1623480	getting a big huff and I mean, you know, he was, he was probably 12.
1623520	1625240	I mean, like, say it didn't happen.
1625400	1625880	Right.
1625880	1628040	He would, he would impugn your memory of that.
1628040	1630040	And I, why would I make that up?
1630040	1633760	And by the way, he was, he was especially livid about this, uh, insinuation
1633760	1637680	that I had concocted that he would, uh, he would wear, he would put a tube
1637680	1641720	sock on his dick and balls, um, and let the sock hang down and be like naked.
1641720	1644480	And he'd run into the living room when my mom was there and be like, ah, and
1644480	1645880	my mom would go stop it.
1646240	1652560	Um, and so he wrote in his email, he was like, what the fuck are you making shit?
1652720	1654120	Like, what are you fucking like?
1654240	1656240	People pay you to make up shit like this?
1656240	1658680	Like kind of like, like really trying to high road me and like, like
1658680	1663000	make me feel like I'm like, and I, and I said, I have a Polaroid of you doing it.
1663000	1670040	Like you just, I literally have photographic evidence in my home of you.
1670040	1674320	Stan, I think mom took the Polaroid because you're standing with your
1674320	1676560	hands on your, on your, on your waist.
1676760	1679960	Like, like a, like a superhero with your, with a sock on your cock.
1680280	1683280	And then, so then his, in his next response, he was like, see, this is
1683280	1684480	starting to sound a little gay.
1684480	1686400	You got pictures of me naked of that.
1686400	1690480	Like, like, you know, like, like, like just dip, dip, dip it and dodge it.
1690480	1692240	And like, like, just own the fucking sock.
1692240	1693200	Like who cares?
1693400	1696880	Anyways, uh, what was the, uh, God damn it.
1696880	1700320	Also he said, and then he said in the same email, he said, and I did it
1700320	1702360	years before the fucking chili peppers.
1704320	1705680	Because I, I mentioned it.
1705680	1707640	I said, I think that the chili peppers did it too.
1707640	1710840	And he bothered to, it's like, you got to pick a flag, man.
1711200	1714240	Like that one I like, like that, be a big brother like that.
1714240	1716040	Like, I'm an innovator.
1716040	1717360	I did it way before, like each other.
1717360	1718920	I was like, Hey man, yeah, you know what?
1718920	1722680	I will put a correction section in my, I didn't, I never, I don't think I
1722680	1725760	implied that the chili peppers did it first, by the way, uh, like we could,
1725760	1729920	we could talk about this all day, but his, his indignance was like, you
1729920	1730960	know, kind of shut things down.
1730960	1734240	And he successfully made me feel bad for making him the butt of my jokes.
1734240	1736720	It's like behind the music, except he's not in a band.
1736760	1740840	And I, when I, when I, when I put myself in his shoes, I, I fully support
1740840	1745440	his, uh, his right to be, uh, emotionally like offended, pissed off,
1745440	1747560	frustrated, irritated, whatever.
1747600	1750280	Which is why I challenge him to come to California.
1750680	1753160	I was offering him, I was giving him the heads up and saying, right.
1753160	1756200	You, anything you write in an email back in response, like I'll just, I'll,
1756200	1757760	I'll have Adam read that too.
1757840	1761400	And, uh, um, at, you know, like, like, like, like, you know, try to get your
1761400	1764080	revenge, I'm not saying that's fair, but it's like what I'm offering.
1764680	1767600	And then he was saying like, you should, you should, I should do, you know,
1768280	1769520	it takes more than that, man.
1769520	1770920	And I was like, what do you, what do you want?
1770960	1771360	I don't know.
1771360	1771960	I don't like them.
1772280	1774920	Um, so he wanted me to get him a, I don't know.
1774920	1778200	I just felt like it was moments from asking for a truck or something.
1778200	1783200	I mean, uh, uh, but what, why, why, why, why, why'd you bring him up?
1784000	1784600	Oh, butt fucks.
1784600	1785400	Yeah, he's, he's done.
1785440	1786000	He's toast.
1786040	1786440	Okay.
1786760	1787120	That's it.
1787520	1790160	Well, we were talking about, we were at the drawing room and talking to Joe
1790160	1791560	Unger about ring of fire.
1791840	1792440	Right.
1792520	1793560	That's how that came up.
1793760	1798600	Joe, who's a regular at the drawing room, uh, we're talking about Johnny Cash.
1798600	1801720	Everyone loves Johnny Cash, playing them on the jukebox for having a good time.
1801760	1803120	Our friend Joe is a great, uh, dude.
1803120	1804360	He's from Tennessee.
1804360	1807240	He's like, he talks with a great Tennessee accent, man.
1807240	1808440	Like you're the real deal.
1808440	1810400	Like he's, he's the, he's the grooviest guy in the world.
1810440	1814400	He's like an old, yeah, kind of Sam Elliott kind of figure at the drawing room.
1814640	1817320	And then he said today, you know, he wasn't perpetuating this
1817320	1822120	myth, but he was in, so somebody, you ever hear of somebody had told me to
1822440	1823360	ring a fire.
1823920	1824760	It was a prisoner.
1824760	1828120	He talked to, he says, I was talking to a prisoner.
1829400	1830720	It was a guy who had been in jail.
1830720	1833520	Like that's like, that's the person that told him that that was going
1833520	1834280	around a prison.
1834280	1835040	That's all right.
1835080	1836360	That, uh, yeah.
1836800	1843120	That Johnny Cash was gay and, uh, that ring of fire is about a man's, uh, butthole.
1846280	1848360	I don't think that's how being gay works.
1849320	1852720	And I don't think that's how being secretly gay country superstar works.
1852720	1855720	And you're like, Oh, I feel like such a fraud.
1856320	1860760	I gotta somehow express myself and my sexuality.
1860960	1864360	I know I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll make a song called ring of fire.
1864360	1866360	The ring of fire secretly be a butthole.
1867080	1870400	That's just, I didn't, that's, that's, uh, I don't think that's how it works.
1871040	1872240	I don't, I don't believe that theory.
1872240	1873200	How do you think it works?
1873520	1874520	Uh, I don't know.
1874520	1875320	Like, well, what do you mean?
1875320	1876400	What did George Michael do?
1876400	1879680	What do you, what do you, what do you do when you're, when you're, when you're,
1879680	1885200	uh, polysexual and you, you live in a, in a straight laced homophobic world and
1885200	1887960	people like to hear you sing and women like to throw panties at you, but you,
1887960	1888920	and you have to write songs.
1889200	1892520	You, you, you are ambiguous about the object of your love.
1892520	1895440	You say, baby, baby, I love, I love sleeping with you.
1895440	1898000	And you know that you're talking about Steve.
1899080	1899240	Yeah.
1899240	1900880	You, you leave he and she out of it.
1900880	1906360	You don't, you don't say, um, there's a circular tunnel in my future.
1907040	1913720	And I'm going inside it like a train, it's walls are brown.
1913720	1922880	And I look around and I like to go here again, but but hold, but hold.
1925080	1929760	You don't do that because that's not what's, uh, gay people are human
1929760	1931680	beings is the theme of the show tonight.
1932000	1935640	Uh, we hate to bury the lead.
1935720	1940000	They're not like, uh, they're not like kids, cereal spokes models that just
1940000	1945400	crave butt holes, like the way a rabbit craves, lucky charms or tricks or whatever.
1945560	1949160	They're not, they're, they're not defined by rabbit craves, lucky, well,
1949160	1956600	whatever, whatever an Irish rabbit, they're not like, they're not like the
1956600	1961920	cookie, the cookie crook, uh, they're, they're, they're, the, the, the butt is
1961920	1965760	just a thing that, uh, you know, is, uh, it's, there's a co-relation.
1965760	1967120	It's not a cause effect relationship.
1968880	1970160	They're not mythical creatures.
1970680	1975320	So tonight, Harmon town tackles the, uh, the, uh, sensitive issue of homosexuality.
1975320	1977920	We're going to, we're going to face this head on and not, not in a weird,
1977920	1979480	like make policy kind of way.
1979480	1982840	And I haven't there, but there's been some big old, uh, big, there's been
1982840	1984960	some big doings in the world of gay rights.
1984960	1986640	I was, I saw something on Reddit.
1986640	1987760	I can't remember what it was.
1987840	1989320	Is it, is anybody well versed on this?
1989320	1990960	Anybody know the, uh, the recent stuff?
1990960	1997480	Wasn't there something in California that can't, ah, yeah, yes, yes.
1997720	1999080	Uh, what's your name, sir?
1999640	2000280	Nathaniel.
2000520	2006280	Uh, though try trying to be the fancy version of, of, of me, uh, I, I've grown
2006280	2010960	up hurt by Nathaniel's when you're, when you're a Daniel in a, in a Nathaniel's
2010960	2016480	world, it hurts, it's, you always feel like less.
2017720	2019560	I wish, I wish, don't, don't complain.
2019600	2023240	I wish some, some, some, some, uh, just hearted, uh, gym coach could
2023240	2024720	have made you into a Daniel.
2024960	2028560	Uh, yeah, that's what Nathaniel, uh, reminded me of is, yeah, they
2028560	2030520	passed legislation in California.
2030600	2032640	It's, it's unconstitutional.
2032640	2034920	I don't know what the, what the language is going to be.
2035160	2040240	It's against the law to, uh, try to, uh, straighten, uh, gay kids when they're
2040240	2045000	like, you know, you can't, it's not, it's not, it's illegal to have, uh,
2045000	2050360	programs that, uh, that cure, oh, these cure camps that you go to and you
2050360	2052640	learn that the reason you're gay is because you don't have enough Jesus in
2052640	2055920	you and stuff, and they've put enough into you to make you a straight.
2055920	2057920	And then they basically kidnapped them.
2059600	2063200	And so it's sort of like, because they're, because they're minors, that guy
2063200	2065760	said they, there's, they, they kind of kidnap you when you're crying.
2065760	2069080	Yeah, because it's like, if you're a, yeah, we, we, the law gets fuzzy when
2069080	2071520	it's like drug addiction and mental illness and stuff.
2071520	2073920	And if you're a minor, then you don't have any, right.
2073960	2077360	But what if you're not addicted to any drugs and you're not crazy, you're just
2077360	2082880	16 and you're kind of gay, uh, you're, you're, you know, the California now says
2082880	2088000	mom and dad have to have to answer to, to the law, if they stuff you in the
2088000	2091720	station wagon and take you to a special place where they show you the glory of
2091720	2101920	the vagina by flashcard is pointing at it with a pointer and that's how I learned
2101920	2112000	it then and it's a trail of M&Ms into these fiberglass vaginas or a little,
2112000	2113000	little trails of dicks.
2113000	2116080	I got like, like, like, cause they're, they're like, look, we, you know, like
2116080	2117880	we're going to, we're going to wean you off it.
2117880	2122320	So no pun intended or little flashcards, the flashcards, there's a hundred of them.
2122320	2126080	They start off like dicks, but they slowly morph into like, kind of neuter.
2126080	2129840	And then they become a vagina at the end of the, if they actually made
2129840	2132640	approaches like that, it would be great because they don't actually just break
2132640	2136960	down even more barriers because halfway through the morphed dick vagina, some
2136960	2140200	kids will go, wait, that's what I like.
2140200	2142480	I didn't even know that was a thing.
2142480	2144120	I'm Googling it.
2144120	2146240	I like that half dick vagina thing.
2146240	2147240	I like that.
2147240	2153000	I like that very small hole with a clitoris the size of a flashlight.
2153000	2154000	I don't know what you call that.
2154000	2156680	Some kind of Dr. Seuss creature.
2156680	2158080	I want, I want one of them.
2158080	2159080	I learned it.
2159080	2161080	I learned it by watching you.
2161080	2162080	Anyways.
2162080	2163080	Yeah.
2163080	2164080	Thank you, California.
2164080	2166320	And there was, I thought it was other stuff.
2166320	2171000	You know, it's, you know, how can we, is it, you know, what I love about gay rights.
2171000	2176320	This is what I love about it as a, as a straight white, fat, lazy liberal.
2176320	2178240	Gay rights is so easy.
2178240	2179800	It's not easy for gay people.
2179800	2183120	They're going through a turbulent time of trying to be treated equally.
2183120	2185160	There's being bullied and whatever.
2185160	2188600	They want to, they want to create a world for, for, for themselves and their loved ones
2188600	2193240	where it shit, like that doesn't matter to the goddamn government, uh, in a world where
2193240	2197720	so much, so much more weird shit doesn't matter to the government.
2197720	2201400	Like they can look the other way on, um, I'm, I'm, I'm proof in it.
2201400	2202400	I'm not going to do it.
2202400	2204240	I'm not, I'm not at his level.
2204240	2208920	I don't read the newspaper, but, but the gay rights thing is so easy.
2208920	2214000	Like you don't expend any energy being in favor of it, but it's, it's, it's like, you
2214000	2221920	know, like, you know, those women that, uh, like, um, yeah, like remember when, uh, remember
2221920	2227920	when that little girl got killed, Joan Benet Ramsey, the little girl, and sometimes this
2227920	2228920	happens on the news.
2228920	2233720	I know it's all, it's all quiet down.
2233720	2238960	There's always the people, like you read about them in like kind of articles and it's like
2238960	2244560	a periphery to the story that because the story is happening, there's people outside
2244560	2250240	the suspect's house, like yelling at them, going like, like you see it on the news, you'll
2250240	2254360	see like B roll of just like these women, it's, it's, it's usually women.
2254360	2261080	I, I, it's okay for me to say that because I realized that women are, I, I, I, these
2261080	2262080	are crazy women.
2262080	2264320	This is not, they're not crazy because of their women.
2264320	2269440	I think they're like watching the news and they see that someone may have killed a baby
2269440	2274040	and they like, they're get, they get so excited, uh, like because the lines between good and
2274040	2276520	evil are so simple for them for a change.
2276520	2280760	And they, they just show up outside these houses with like bloody Barbie dolls and go
2280760	2289040	whore killer, you're a killer, baby killer, like, and it's like, you want, like, what
2289040	2292120	a brave stance.
2292120	2293320	I'm such a hero.
2293320	2298240	You're so like, I should really pitch in, you know, and here I am on my way to work
2298240	2301760	while I let the justice system deal with someone who may have killed a baby.
2301760	2306480	I, I should really be on the front lines of things, letting that person who may or may
2306480	2310040	not have killed a baby know that I'm against killing babies.
2310040	2314360	Dan, are you soft on baby killing?
2314360	2316200	Softer than these strange people.
2316200	2320120	And I guess that there's, there's a relationship I'm trying there.
2320120	2321120	I'm pointing at myself.
2321120	2322120	I'm looking at the man in the mirror.
2322120	2327320	Dan Harmon would rather have a jacuzzi jet up his asshole than save a baby being killed.
2327320	2328320	Come on, man.
2328320	2339880	I'm in the middle of, I can't remember what I was saying, it's just more like comp interop-terr-ling.
2339880	2340880	Interloping.
2340880	2341880	I don't know.
2341880	2346960	I, is that, cause I, when I, I think, I think, well, why am I, I'm, I'm, I'm a pretty, I'm,
2346960	2350280	I'm an advocate of my, my, my, my gay chums.
2350280	2354840	I want them to have everything that they can possibly have and more, I'll say that more,
2354840	2357960	I think they're, I think they should be gayer and I think I should, and they should have
2357960	2359320	more of the gayer they are.
2359320	2362960	I think you should, I think there should be a social program that if you, if you register
2362960	2368840	as an official gay person, you should, you should have a better car because you're out
2368840	2373760	there representing the forefront of, of, of, of, of a raised consciousness.
2373760	2374760	A gay reward system.
2374760	2380920	Yeah, give you like a little, whatever, I'm, I'm being glib, but, but why is that so easy
2380920	2381920	for me to say?
2381920	2383400	Well, because it's easy.
2383400	2387840	Because the alternative is, is like you're, is like these, these idiots, like who cares
2387840	2390000	what gay people do?
2390000	2395400	How often do you get an opportunity to be heroic by saying, I don't care what you do?
2395400	2397640	It's like, that's, that's a lazy person's dream.
2397640	2400280	So I'm calling myself out on that as my point.
2400280	2405200	I'm being like a, just a fat Southern lady on the front lawn of a suspected murderer
2405200	2410480	yelling baby killer when I say, great job, California, I'm passing that gay legislation.
2410480	2411480	Yeah.
2411480	2412480	Yeah.
2412480	2415240	So who cares, Harmon?
2415240	2420040	Your cookies in the mail from the gay Federation.
2420040	2424000	How do you think you, uh, you could properly, uh, properly reward the gay community?
2424000	2425000	Like what?
2425000	2431200	Big kiss.
2431200	2432200	I don't, what do you mean?
2432200	2433200	Money?
2433200	2434200	I don't know.
2434200	2437280	I got, I give to that, I give to that, uh, that, uh, that organization, I should give
2437280	2438280	more actually.
2438280	2441200	I think I'm, I, I slouched out of it this year.
2441200	2443880	There's a, and I'm not saying this is where anybody should spend their money, but I, I,
2443880	2445920	I, something very comforting to me about it.
2445920	2451520	There's the, I can't, it's called the, uh, the Los Angeles, uh, Gay and Lesbian Center.
2451520	2457400	Uh, and they, they, the money that you give them goes to just helping like super, like,
2457400	2462160	you know, like, like teen runaways, basically specifically who are running away from a life
2462160	2467520	that's being hard on them because they are lesbian, gay, bisexual, whatever, uh, transgender.
2467520	2472200	Uh, and, uh, and they, they, like, like, like, like kids that are going to end up like because
2472200	2475160	of that, you know, they're just going to become a statistic.
2475160	2476360	They're going to, their life's going to go downhill.
2476360	2480560	They kind of like, there's, it's a shelter you can go to and like, they give you a certain
2480560	2484960	amount of time that you can just stay there for free and get your shit together.
2484960	2487560	And there's some, you know, there's, there's programs and stuff from there.
2487560	2491320	And they try to kind of just try it because a lot of people come to LA like running from
2491320	2496640	shit in Iowa and, uh, and it's a, it's, it's a nicer place for someone to end up if they're
2496640	2500080	anyways, you know, hunger is a better thing to solve with your money.
2500080	2504600	I'm not, uh, whatever I, uh, you asked how to give back to the gay community.
2504600	2508440	If you're wondering, the library of Congress suggests the LA gay lesbian center.
2508480	2509440	I probably got the name wrong.
2510640	2512480	I was on the road doing comedy shows.
2512480	2515240	We were like in central, like Missouri and Illinois.
2515600	2520760	And, um, I'm straight, but not, you know, you wouldn't, like, if I walk, when I walk
2520760	2527200	into a restaurant in, uh, or a bar in, uh, in really rural America, they're safe to
2527200	2529000	assume that I could be from the moon.
2529040	2531240	Like, I don't look like anybody that's from there.
2531520	2534320	And when I say, Oh, uh, do you have anything as vegetarian?
2534400	2538120	I, that it's, it's, I almost get gay bashed for that.
2539040	2543640	Like, uh, yeah, it's, uh, being vegetarian in certain parts of the country is pretty
2543640	2544120	rough.
2544920	2553200	So, uh, I feel like I can relate to the, uh, to the, to the persecution.
2555400	2555640	Yeah.
2555640	2558600	Well, it's like, I feel, I feel bullied by my gardener.
2563200	2564520	I don't know what he's doing.
2564520	2566280	I don't think that's fair.
2566280	2568960	Like, do I have to learn special gardener language?
2569640	2570400	What would you call it?
2570400	2576920	Spanish in order to, in order to be able to say, sorry, Julieta, our friend visiting
2576920	2580880	from Mexico, uh, the, uh, you're not a gardener.
2582920	2585040	You are, you have a gardener.
2587920	2588600	She's rich.
2591040	2592400	What nationality is your gardener?
2593600	2594160	There you go.
2594840	2597080	It's supposed to be so much more uncomfortable there, right?
2597120	2599840	And you're like, I'm kidding.
2599840	2604520	I don't, I don't, can we talk about the fact that you told me a story about
2604640	2606200	sometimes your TV turns on.
2606200	2607680	Wait, I want to ask Julieta something.
2607680	2610680	I just, I was, I have an actual Mexican national in the audience.
2610680	2614680	I want to ask about the music because there's guys working on my house right now.
2614840	2617120	This is continuing the theme of unlikability.
2617120	2619520	I'm an un, uncharismatic person.
2619560	2621360	I am, I am, I'm lazy.
2621360	2622520	Well, it sounds like polka.
2622520	2622960	Yeah.
2623160	2623840	Oh, sorry.
2626000	2626480	Okay.
2627200	2627880	Want a cookie?
2628000	2630280	Uh, no, I know.
2630280	2630640	I know you.
2631640	2635080	He made a very sad face and held out his hand and not at his head.
2635800	2637520	It's not, not, not, not in your style.
2637520	2637760	Right.
2637760	2640320	That, that, that, that, that accordions, right?
2641360	2641680	Yeah.
2641720	2644520	It sounds so much like polka though, that it's crazy.
2644720	2646600	It's like Joseph Campbell would go crazy.
2646640	2649080	Like what, how, how did, I don't understand the connection
2649080	2650560	between Poland and Mexico.
2651240	2653320	Well, that's the geographic connection.
2653320	2653480	Yeah.
2654640	2654920	All right.
2654920	2655360	There you go.
2655360	2661520	So, so the German immigrants to the north of the country and then it just, it just
2661520	2664280	merged and now everybody likes it.
2664280	2665320	And I'm running away from it.
2667200	2669920	Do we have that mic or should we repeat that for the podcast?
2669920	2671240	So that's probably not going to be heard.
2671240	2671480	Right.
2671520	2673520	Should we have Julieta come up as a special pass?
2675120	2678880	We're going to bring Julieta up from Mexico.
2680760	2682080	Julieta, everybody from Mexico.
2682080	2686320	She's going to explain to us why the, why the polka music sounds like here.
2686320	2687800	You can take this mic and I'll grab one.
2688440	2688840	Okay.
2689280	2689520	Yeah.
2689520	2692160	This is a very interesting story from the north of the country.
2692280	2693480	Wait, I want to introduce you first.
2694360	2698920	Julieta for, uh, for, for hardcore Armenians, like people who are cross
2698920	2702840	platform, multiple year Armenians.
2703200	2708720	Uh, Julieta was a community fan who drew, draws a lot of the cool community fan
2708720	2710840	art you, you'd see her on Twitter.
2710840	2714720	She's at Juju Juliet, Juju Julieta at Juju Julieta.
2714720	2719560	I've seen you, you, you've seen some, some interesting like community fan art,
2719560	2721040	some of which I have hanging in my home.
2721040	2724840	Julieta is one of the many, uh, anyways, but she, but she was based in Mexico
2724840	2728080	and that she's out here visiting and looking for job opportunities and stuff.
2728360	2730600	So now don't tell, don't tell immigration.
2730640	2731480	I want to hear the story.
2733960	2735920	She said she's out here getting married.
2737040	2738560	Is that, is that what the, how it works?
2738560	2738880	I don't know.
2739680	2742960	She's, she's out, she's out here taking pictures of the Hollywood sign.
2744280	2745280	Over and over again.
2745840	2747800	Do you think immigration listens to podcasts?
2749800	2753640	I absolutely have no intentions instilling jobs from American or, or, you
2753640	2754640	know, stealing their wives.
2754680	2755840	That's not what I'm doing here.
2755920	2759880	Just also don't check, check your clothes for seeds and other agriculture.
2759880	2762640	When you go home, I'm definitely not smuggling anything.
2762640	2767280	I don't want any of our fine iceberg lettuce, uh, growing and it'll
2767320	2768600	fuck up your whole ecosystem.
2768600	2770680	You know, it's 98% water.
2771360	2772160	That's the secret.
2772280	2775680	Um, I don't, I don't, I don't, I want to hear the story of the guy
2775680	2779200	climbing in your window and you really want to hear that story.
2779200	2779440	Yeah.
2779440	2783320	It's like, uh, you know, I watched CNN to get, we don't watch CNN.
2783320	2787600	So like, here's a glimpse of, of, uh, just this small part of where
2787600	2788520	in Mexico are you from?
2788560	2790080	I'm from, uh, Monterey.
2790120	2792320	It's the Northeast of the country, just south of Texas.
2792880	2796240	Uh, yeah, it's the pretty cool way to the States.
2796280	2798160	Do you want to tell that story that you were watching?
2798160	2799320	You were watching community.
2799360	2802080	I was watching, uh, the claymation episode.
2802200	2805160	Uh, it was like 7 45 PM.
2805160	2807080	I was watching it on stream or something.
2807080	2809880	And suddenly a guy just went into this room.
2809920	2811200	My house is very weird.
2811600	2814080	And I just like looked away from a computer.
2814080	2818680	I was reading an article on the studio and I was like, excuse me.
2819640	2822680	And, uh, then he was just like, I'm going to take this.
2822680	2825160	He was just trying to grab my brother's laptop.
2825200	2825960	He came in the window.
2826240	2827520	No, no, just through a door.
2827560	2828840	Oh, it came through the door door.
2828840	2833360	Yeah, she's still illegal.
2833360	2838240	Somebody said we got a lawyer in the crowd.
2839600	2843520	Ladies and gentlemen, the jury, you're going to hear the defense emphasize
2843520	2847800	that he came through a door and that you come through doors on your birthday.
2847800	2849760	And when you love your mother, you come through a door.
2850040	2851600	It's still illegal.
2852600	2853600	It's not a,
2856000	2857520	the actual clips from Twilight.
2857520	2857920	Actually,
2857920	2858920	isn't that true though?
2858920	2861120	Jilly, I don't know that you use your door as a window.
2861120	2863840	Sometimes don't you?
2863840	2866800	I quote your uncle at a movie theater.
2866840	2868800	This is from last July.
2868800	2871200	He said, you made a better door than a window.
2874720	2876000	That's prosecution rests.
2877000	2877400	All right.
2877400	2877680	Sorry.
2877680	2878000	Anyways,
2878800	2884200	actually he jumped a fence and he dropped about 18 feet.
2884480	2885840	So my house is really strange.
2885840	2887480	And then he came to through that door.
2887600	2888200	Oh Jesus.
2888240	2888720	Yeah.
2888720	2890560	He was a desperate man coming in.
2890560	2890880	Yeah.
2890880	2894920	I think I'd already tried to steal a car before that same guy, same guy.
2895080	2897880	And he also tried to rob a woman with a knife before that.
2897920	2902640	He, he got nothing right because in the end, my dad, he just beat the shit out of him.
2902760	2903040	Right.
2904040	2904600	Good.
2904600	2909280	And, uh, yeah, it's like, it's like dead wood down there.
2910880	2911200	Yeah.
2911200	2913600	At some point, my mom came out with a sword.
2913640	2914840	I am not kidding.
2914840	2917680	Wait, wait, wait a second down there.
2918720	2919320	I am not.
2919320	2921480	Your, your, your mother wields a sword.
2921840	2924000	She, she wasn't, she's a fencer.
2924080	2924480	She is.
2924480	2926000	She, uh, she did fencing.
2926040	2926480	Oh, really?
2926480	2927080	She did fencing.
2927080	2929800	So she likes swords and she had a like a saber or a pay.
2930000	2931040	Uh, no, it wasn't a pay.
2931040	2931320	All right.
2931320	2931720	Okay.
2931720	2932200	That's good.
2932480	2934240	Either way, this guy picked the wrong house.
2935720	2937360	Then my dad is like six four.
2937680	2940240	So it was just, he's like, he's like the Spencer.
2940400	2942160	He's they call him L Spencer.
2942280	2944560	Uh, Spencer's our dungeon master.
2944560	2945520	He's a giant.
2945520	2946480	So what happened to the guy?
2946520	2950280	He, your, your dad, your dad kicked the tar out of him.
2950280	2950920	And, uh, yeah.
2950920	2954040	And, and then my mom was like, your dad's glasses.
2954040	2957640	He can't say without these glasses because he took the glasses off to find the guy.
2958000	2959000	Uh, yeah.
2959000	2961920	No, the guy's in jail, uh, for the next 14 years or something.
2962240	2965280	It was like, finally, something worked out.
2965320	2967800	Uh, and you left all that to come here, huh?
2970680	2972200	That was like two years ago.
2972240	2972600	Really?
2972880	2973560	Almost three.
2973560	2975560	So, uh, but that was the point where you started.
2975560	2975720	Yeah.
2975720	2977280	You're like, I should get a passport.
2977520	2981920	Uh, I already had one, but yeah, I was like, I need to, I really need to get the fuck out of here.
2983880	2986120	Well, for the first thing pushing me out was the music.
2986240	2986480	Oh yeah.
2986480	2986640	Yeah.
2986640	2986800	Yeah.
2986800	2986880	Yeah.
2986880	2986880	
2986880	2987680	We're talking about the music.
2987680	2988040	So all right.
2988040	2992840	Just poker music, repeat what you said as an explanation for how poker ends up, poker
2992840	2994720	sounding music ends up coming out of a boombox.
2995000	3000440	Uh, or the guys that are painting my ceiling, like who don't, who don't seem Polish, but
3000440	3002920	the music sounds so, I'm from Milwaukee.
3002960	3006600	I know, uh, uh, uh, uh, Polish culture.
3007480	3008280	I bowl.
3009880	3014960	I have like 150 average spares and stuff.
3014960	3018480	But this, this start is not as interesting as just, uh, German immigrants coming to the
3018480	3023520	north of the country and just settling there and mixing with the people from there.
3023600	3028240	And that's why people like me are white, um, in Mexico.
3030600	3032360	So yeah, that's, that's basically it.
3032360	3036440	And it's like just regional music and, uh, it's, it's, it's awful.
3036840	3039240	Uh, but it's mostly from the north and north of the country.
3039240	3043520	But I, I assume like, like, yeah, cause country Western is pretty, it sounds pretty similar
3043520	3048560	and a lot of like, uh, like when you get specific with a specific type of music, like,
3048560	3052800	and you're just listening to that type of music, like, I can't, I can't tell the difference
3052800	3055560	between, uh, I don't know what, what, what genre of music you call it.
3055560	3062600	When you hear like, uh, uh, a young black woman going, cause you made me feel it.
3066600	3070240	Like, it's kinda like, it's more of a, like a showcase of their vocal cords.
3070240	3072120	And there's no, you can't even hear the music behind it.
3072120	3079680	She's got some pipes on her, like, like, I, I don't, I wouldn't know, if you played three of those in a row,
3079680	3081080	I'd be like, is this the same album?
3081080	3087720	And you get, you get mad and go, uh, no, that was like, one thing was from 78 and I'd go, I'm sorry.
3087720	3089120	Can we hear a little more of that?
3090120	3102520	You treated me kind, but it is from the break of dawn to the evening light.
3102520	3123520	We felt the time when you give me, give me, give me, woo woo woo, woo woo woo, in the city.
3125520	3126520	In the city.
3127520	3128520	That's Lou Reed.
3129520	3131520	Uh, let's, let's hear it for Giulietta.
3131520	3132520	Thank you for coming.
3135520	3137520	Our correspondent from south of the border.
3139520	3154520	If you're looking for someone to draw something, uh, and you can, uh, provide a, uh, something that would, that would, uh, uh, work on a work visa form, you know, you want to be an animator or you are, you are an animator.
3154520	3159520	Yeah. So Juju Giulietta at Twitter.
3159520	3160520	Was that a fight?
3160520	3161520	Did you guys have a fight there?
3161520	3162520	Do you want to be an animator?
3162520	3164520	I am an animator.
3164520	3165520	It was a little fight.
3166520	3168520	I'm the only one that picks up on this stuff.
3168520	3171520	I know when people are pissed, Giulietta is pissed.
3171520	3173520	That was pretty good singing, Harmon.
3173520	3175520	I didn't, uh, I didn't know you had that range.
3175520	3177520	You made me feel school.
3178520	3180520	There are my titties.
3181520	3183520	Going down to the avenue.
3184520	3189520	I mean, I'm very seventies, uh, racist with the titties in the avenue and the street.
3190520	3195520	The lyrics, like they, they, they, it's like, like, like, like, like, who am I thinking of?
3195520	3204520	Like, they say, if you pick out the lyrics, like, it's really just about, like, it's about loving and, and people being loved and are you coming to love me and I knew you, I let you go.
3204520	3210520	And yeah, it's just like, it's just so, because you're not listening, you're listening to the person and going like, holy shit, she can really sing.
3211520	3215520	But, but you, you have a surprising range of octaves.
3215520	3217520	You're like, you're like, you're like Mariah Carey.
3218520	3219520	God rest your soul.
3223520	3225520	I wasn't, I wasn't trying to be funny.
3226520	3233520	Do you remember when, uh, do you remember when Whitney Houston died and the next day her best of album was like...
3233520	3234520	Cynically released?
3235520	3238520	Uh, no, it was already, it was, it was just five dollars more.
3238520	3239520	Oh yeah, that's right.
3239520	3245520	And, and everyone thought it was, everyone wrote into Apple and said, how dare you, that's really crass and disgusting, have some respect.
3245520	3251520	Uh, and Apple went, oh no, no, we have, as you might expect, Apple is run by a computer.
3251520	3254520	Uh, the price goes up when the wholesale price goes up.
3254520	3258520	Like, it's just an algorithm and everyone slowly turned to Sony Records.
3258520	3262520	And Sony Records went, oh, what, what the hell?
3264520	3265520	What a mistake.
3265520	3266520	I don't know.
3267520	3271520	No apology, no admission of, of ghoulism.
3272520	3274520	Just, just a simple, like, I didn't do it.
3275520	3276520	Jerry, did you do it?
3276520	3277520	I didn't do it.
3278520	3279520	What's her algorithm?
3285520	3287520	I ain't got no algorithms over here.
3287520	3302520	I, I hope, I hope her ghost, her, I hope her beautiful sounding ghost is, uh, is, is, uh, hitting high C boos, uh, in their breezeways, keeping their children awake.
3307520	3308520	What's the highest note you can hit?
3308520	3309520	Cause you got pretty high in there.
3309520	3315520	Start, start, start in your, start in your middle, like, baritone tenor, and then I want to see how high you can actually hit a note.
3316520	3317520	I was impressed there.
3317520	3319520	Is there a song that goes up to a certain point?
3320520	3321520	Should we get a song?
3326520	3327520	I will always love you.
3327520	3329520	I don't know the lyrics to that.
3329520	3330520	I'm sorry.
3331520	3336520	And, uh, well, I know that part, but, but I need to lead up to it, right?
3338520	3341520	Don't, don't, don't hit your wagon to any real song.
3341520	3345520	You, I want to, I want to lead up to it.
3346520	3352520	You gave myself the best of me, and you gave you myself too.
3353520	3366520	You treated me, treated me good, and you made me feel like I could go high, high, high.
3367520	3368520	What is that?
3369520	3371520	Is that like a, is that like an A cup?
3372520	3373520	What is the terminology?
3373520	3376520	I think that was a, that was flat L.
3380520	3388520	Um, I think I'm, oh, I'm sick of having these conversations about head high versus body high at the dispensary.
3389520	3395520	Oh, I'm sick of having these conversations about head high versus body high at the dispensary.
3396520	3399520	I don't get it. I'm never going to get it.
3399520	3404520	I, it seems to me that if my body gets high enough, my head's going to freak out anyway.
3405520	3408520	I don't know. There's no logic to that distinction.
3408520	3413520	If my head gets high, because here's what I want to avoid, smoking pot and freaking out and going like,
3413520	3414520	I shouldn't be smoking pot.
3414520	3416520	I'm 39. What am I doing with my life?
3416520	3421520	And then running into the street like Martin Lawrence in my underwear, but I'm pot, you know,
3421520	3425520	I'm just going like, I'm getting hungry and falling asleep.
3425520	3429520	But, uh, I just, you know, like, how is that?
3429520	3432520	How does that help with going, well, there's more of a head high.
3432520	3433520	What does that mean?
3433520	3435520	What is it? What is a head high?
3435520	3436520	That's stupid.
3436520	3437520	I'm complaining about this.
3437520	3441520	This is in my segment of complaining about things you have no right to complain about.
3441520	3444520	But you can't tell the difference between those two things.
3444520	3445520	Well, I don't know.
3445520	3449520	I can't because if my body gets high, what does that mean?
3449520	3450520	That doesn't make any sense.
3450520	3452520	Your arms and legs don't work.
3452520	3454520	And like your body is all like...
3454520	3455520	It doesn't. That's not how...
3455520	3456520	For me, like...
3456520	3457520	That's not a thing, though.
3457520	3461520	Your head's not like on top of a body that's like is high.
3461520	3462520	That's dumb.
3462520	3464520	Wait, Dan, Dan, Dan, hold on.
3464520	3467520	Do you do drugs?
3467520	3468520	No, I just...
3468520	3471520	If I find out that you have been doing drugs, I'm very disappointed.
3471520	3474520	I have a lot of anxiety and I have a prescription.
3474520	3477520	This is the great state of California.
3478520	3479520	So you got renewed.
3479520	3480520	Yeah.
3481520	3482520	What did you get?
3482520	3483520	Body high.
3484520	3485520	I'm just going to commit to that.
3486520	3487520	I don't know.
3487520	3488520	See, it's always...
3488520	3489520	Body high.
3489520	3490520	It's got stuff on the board.
3490520	3500520	It says like banana fruit, yuckas, Obi-Wan, Skywalker, Yoda plenty, O.G., kush kush,
3500520	3503520	the orange dynamite.
3503520	3504520	Orange?
3504520	3506520	You give it a rest.
3506520	3507520	You guys are high.
3508520	3511520	You go into these places and it's like...
3511520	3514520	You guys are high when you furnished this place.
3514520	3517520	You were high when you said let's open a pot store.
3517520	3520520	You were high last night when you took inventory.
3520520	3523520	You're high when you're giving me change.
3523520	3524520	It's adorable.
3525520	3531520	I'll take 20 grams of apple nut cinnacruz.
3532520	3535520	I want to give you a challenge.
3535520	3542520	I love apple nut cinnacruz, but would you name me three other strains of weed at your
3542520	3543520	dispensary?
3543520	3557520	Yeah, like octo, octo diamonds, and blue monkey, and critter bitter, back tacks.
3557520	3560520	That's right.
3560520	3561520	That's right.
3561520	3568520	Romney razor, back to the future part kush.
3576520	3583520	Desperado, Mindy Kaling, extreme.
3584520	3587520	Did Spencer get here?
3587520	3588520	Spencer?
3588520	3589520	Spencer, come up on stage right now.
3589520	3595520	Spencer, our dungeon master, get up here.
3595520	3601520	And also, before Spencer sets up, a reminder, Halloween, what's the Harman town right before
3601520	3602520	Halloween?
3602520	3605520	There's one on the 22nd and then there's one on the 29th.
3605520	3610520	For the 29th, I would say that's going to be our Halloween night.
3610520	3613520	Dan and I and Aaron McGathey.
3613520	3619520	We will all be dressed as Jareth from the movie Labyrinth, David Bowie's character.
3619520	3621520	And we encourage you all to come here.
3621520	3624520	We want a room full of Jareths.
3624520	3628520	We want the more Jareths, the better, and may the best Jareth win.
3628520	3632520	And we're all going to find some poor fucking bar in Los Angeles.
3632520	3636520	And I want 900 Jareths to walk into that bar.
3636520	3641520	So please, October 29th, please come in your Jareth costume.
3641520	3643520	You got a mic over there, Spencer?
3643520	3644520	Yeah.
3644520	3651520	Did anyone who wasn't drinking as much as me remember, did Adam Goldberg close the show last week?
3651520	3652520	He did.
3652520	3654520	Adam, are you here?
3654520	3657520	If I recall, you sang an aria to end our show last time.
3657520	3658520	Did you come up on stage?
3658520	3659520	He did.
3659520	3660520	He stood right here and he sang a...
3660520	3661520	It's all a blackout.
3661520	3664520	He kind of sang like a Man of La Mancha kind of thing up here.
3664520	3665520	It was fantastic.
3665520	3666520	Was it good?
3666520	3667520	It was a good.
3667520	3668520	It ended our show.
3668520	3669520	Well, I don't know.
3669520	3672520	Maybe people got mad and left.
3672520	3674520	No, it was triumphant.
3674520	3675520	I can't remember.
3675520	3676520	It was a triumph.
3676520	3686520	Spencer, catch us up with one of your patented Spencer recaps.
3686520	3687520	All right.
3687520	3689520	Let's see here.
3690520	3692520	When we last met, our heroes...
3695520	3697520	You guys are throwing me off.
3697520	3703520	When we last met, our heroes were turning in a quest to the captain of the wardens, Ferris,
3703520	3705520	played by Greg Proops.
3705520	3707520	It was cool.
3707520	3713520	After getting the quest turned in, they adjourned to the tavern where they met with Cha-Cha.
3713520	3718520	Cha-Cha reminded them of their encounter with Tylenol with Codeen, a mystical unicorn
3718520	3723520	revealed to be the patron saint of the Connie Forest.
3723520	3725520	There was a guy who gave you guys horses.
3725520	3728520	He gave you a strange emerald dagger.
3728520	3729520	Right.
3729520	3737520	You were introduced to the hastily cobbled together figure, Admiral Darkstar.
3738520	3745520	It was said that he's lords over part of the forest that Tylenol lives in.
3745520	3749520	There's an evil part of the forest that is threatening to overtake the good part of the forest.
3749520	3755520	The forces of Admiral Darkstar threaten to overtake the forest of Connie through the shadows.
3755520	3758520	He's an admiral in what, Navy?
3758520	3759520	You don't know.
3759520	3761520	You don't have the internet.
3761520	3763520	Okay.
3763520	3764520	All right.
3764520	3766520	Snap.
3766520	3767520	Dungeon snap.
3767520	3771520	It's a very snarky god.
3771520	3774520	You got dungeon snapped.
3774520	3775520	All right.
3775520	3778520	Dungeon snapped me.
3778520	3782520	Feeding my bosom like the ocean.
3782520	3784520	Deep as my heart.
3784520	3785520	Snap.
3785520	3786520	Dungeon.
3786520	3787520	Snap.
3787520	3788520	Dungeon.
3788520	3790520	Snap.
3790520	3799520	You guys are clapping wearily like anyone asked you to clap.
3799520	3805520	Dan, that got precisely the amount of applause that deserved.
3805520	3808520	I didn't want any.
3808520	3814520	And I resent you acting like I wanted any by going by slow clapping it.
3814520	3816520	Like a tired old rich uncle.
3816520	3817520	No.
3817520	3819520	They were just punctuating it.
3819520	3822520	All right Spencer, where do we stand right now?
3822520	3825520	You had fell in a sleep at camp.
3825520	3828520	You awaken a stupor and you're not sure exactly what's happening.
3828520	3830520	Tylenol with Codeine is gone.
3830520	3834520	Was he really there or did you imagine the whole thing?
3834520	3839520	All the same you feel like you should investigate the forest of shadows.
3839520	3841520	Where did Mulrain Sedana go?
3841520	3844520	Our half elf companion.
3844520	3846520	You want to come up here?
3846520	3847520	Is she playing?
3847520	3848520	I don't know.
3848520	3852520	She was gone last week and we just went and hung out with the unicorns.
3852520	3854520	I don't think she's there.
3854520	3859520	In your high adventures you had managed to wander away from your compatriot Mulrain Sedana.
3859520	3863520	But being a ranger adept at tracking, she's managed to find you.
3863520	3869520	You'll never get away.
3869520	3874520	Yeah, that's good dungeon mastering there.
3875520	3877520	Adventure.
3880520	3882520	I investigate our surroundings.
3882520	3887520	You see a winding path that heads towards gnarled dark trees.
3887520	3892520	Perhaps these are twisted by the arcane workings of the forest of shadows.
3892520	3893520	That's where we're going.
3893520	3895520	You know we're still first level.
3895520	3899520	We keep acting like we're up for bigger and badder shit.
3899520	3901520	I don't know. I'm just a little worried.
3901520	3903520	I would like to exercise caution.
3903520	3905520	I don't want to die.
3905520	3908520	We're not level two.
3908520	3910520	Well, look.
3910520	3917520	I'm a gnome barbarian and I'm always spoiling for a fight.
3917520	3922520	There's one thing that I hate. It's a gnarled tree.
3922520	3924520	I'm going to go right out those motherfuckers.
3924520	3925520	We don't even know.
3925520	3927520	So far we've been mercenaries.
3927520	3930520	Working for a promised reward.
3930520	3931520	Some bauble.
3931520	3933520	Are we after anything right now?
3933520	3937520	Now we're just caring about a unicorn's forest.
3937520	3940520	Spencer, what are we headed toward?
3940520	3942520	What's our goal right now?
3942520	3949520	Admiral Darkstar hosts a dark ziggurat deep within the forest of shadows where his dark cult...
3949520	3951520	What's a ziggurat again?
3951520	3953520	It's like a temple.
3953520	3955520	Temple to ancient evil.
3955520	3960520	Mayhaps where dark rituals and sacrifices and midnights...
3960520	3966520	Well, I have you. What's a duvet?
3966520	3968520	It's just a blanket, right?
3968520	3970520	I thought it was a blanket.
3970520	3974520	It's a sheet that you put a blanket inside.
3974520	3976520	No, it's the inside part.
3976520	3978520	There's a duvet cover and then there's a duvet.
3978520	3979520	Yeah, you put the duvet in there.
3979520	3984520	Isn't that just a comforter?
3984520	3987520	Do you have a duvet in your inventory?
3987520	3989520	He knows what a ziggurat is.
3989520	3991520	I've got a bedroll. Is that like a duvet?
3991520	3994520	Yeah, I had a bedroll. I lost my bedroll.
3994520	3995520	Spencer...
3995520	3996520	I'm going to go out on a limb here.
3996520	3998520	Here's a bad pitch. Crazy pitch.
3998520	3999520	Okay.
3999520	4002520	Hey, just spitball.
4002520	4006520	It's a very dangerous life we're living.
4006520	4011520	There's nothing wrong with just walking away from...
4011520	4015520	This dark forest is going to take over the light forest.
4015520	4018520	Is anyone really going to die? It's just going to be a darker forest.
4018520	4021520	They're already hazardous places.
4021520	4025520	What sort of life are you going to go back to? What do you got back home?
4025520	4028520	I'm not going to go back home. I just want to do different adventures.
4028520	4029520	Do what?
4029520	4032520	We don't even know who we are, man.
4032520	4037520	What is this world?
4037520	4043520	I thought we made an agreement that when we met in the mines of Calderon...
4043520	4045520	The howling mines of Calderon.
4045520	4048520	Dude, do you not remember the howling mines of Calderon?
4048520	4050520	It's not cool to bring that up.
4050520	4054520	And I storm off into the woods.
4054520	4056520	I catch up with Quark.
4056520	4057520	Quark.
4057520	4059520	Sharpie. I'm Sharpie.
4059520	4061520	Oh, sorry. I'm very sorry.
4061520	4063520	Should I leave?
4063520	4067520	No, no. I was speaking to the both of you.
4067520	4074520	Perhaps you should just kiss each other's ring of fires and be happy.
4074520	4076520	Call back.
4076520	4079520	Why do we keep hanging out with a homophobic elf?
4079520	4081520	I'm not a homophobic. You're a homophobic.
4081520	4083520	You keep making us gay.
4083520	4085520	You're a homophobic by discouraging the homosexuality.
4085520	4090520	I'm a homo-encourage-omic.
4090520	4098520	I'm out of earshot of this because I've picked a sentimentally lit clearing in the woods.
4098520	4102520	If possible, if there's a place where there's a lake, I'm looking at the lake.
4102520	4104520	But I'm not presuming the presence of a lake.
4104520	4105520	Is there a lake?
4105520	4111520	And I'm looking and I'm seeing the reflection of my father's face on the water.
4111520	4115520	And I'm having flashbacks to my early life.
4115520	4119520	I'm just hearing echoey voiceover of things like,
4119520	4125520	Sharpie, you've got to try harder than that.
4125520	4127520	You're no son of mine.
4127520	4128520	Mine.
4128520	4133520	I'm kissing my arrows.
4133520	4136520	That's how I count.
4136520	4139520	Well, if you guys are going to stand around and play grab-ass,
4139520	4142520	I'm going to go toward the gnarled trees.
4142520	4148520	If you want to park company, I'm more of an adventurer than maybe you are.
4148520	4151520	I feel guilty and catch up with Quark.
4151520	4156520	I want to keep having my emotional moment, but I want to do it in turns.
4156520	4160520	I don't want to take up any more time than an average round of melee.
4160520	4161520	Do you want to do it in song, maybe?
4161520	4162520	No, no.
4162520	4165520	Do you want to look in the lake and maybe sing in a high falsetto?
4165520	4171520	I'm having a Dexter flashback to a conversation with my dad and his magic workshop.
4171520	4173520	Dad, what are you doing?
4173520	4177520	I'm making a wand, son.
4177520	4182520	I'm making a wand, son.
4182520	4186520	So is the wand magic automatically just because you make it?
4186520	4189520	Oh, you're magic. We're all magic.
4189520	4193520	I am magic.
4193520	4196520	God damn it, you're going to hit.
4196520	4197520	Dad.
4197520	4199520	I hit you.
4200520	4204520	Sorry, son, it's not about you.
4204520	4209520	Dad, what is it? You can talk to me about anything.
4209520	4211520	It's your mother.
4211520	4214520	I had a mother?
4214520	4220520	You have a mother, I keep her in a hole underneath pounds and pounds of leaves.
4220520	4226520	She's giving me a lot of shit lately for keeping her in that hole.
4227520	4232520	Just don't get mixed up with a woman and don't put her in a hole.
4232520	4237520	Also, I have pancreatic cancer.
4237520	4241520	All right, I shake out of my doldrums and I find my compatriots,
4241520	4246520	newly invigorated by a recent emotional epiphany.
4246520	4250520	Meeting back up with your compatriots, they seem surprised that you've arrived so quickly.
4250520	4257520	I just had a flashback at the lake about my parents and I want to go back to my hometown.
4257520	4260520	That's right, son. Believe in yourself.
4260520	4265520	That fire inside of you is true and it's going to burn down any dishonesty.
4265520	4268520	I can hear him right now.
4268520	4271520	And I'm not going to be able to give my all to this admiral dark star mission
4271520	4274520	while I'm listening to thoughts of my father.
4274520	4276520	I've got to go back and talk to him.
4276520	4278520	I've got to find out who I am.
4278520	4281520	Is there a chance that your father is admiral dark star?
4281520	4285520	You'd love that, wouldn't you?
4285520	4292520	Maybe the atonement with the father on this mission is maybe a literal father.
4292520	4298520	Maybe what we're after is for you to atone with yourself and your lack of self-worth
4298520	4302520	and what you call your superiority complex, this weird inferiority complex
4302520	4307520	because you never live up to the expectations your father put on you.
4307520	4311520	Promise me something, Quirk. If I do this mission with you,
4311520	4317520	we bring admiral dark star to justice. Come with me to my homeland
4317520	4323520	so I can learn who I am.
4323520	4329520	I will do it under one condition and you have to make me a promise.
4329520	4332520	I will.
4332520	4340520	That she'll consecrate this pact in song.
4340520	4346520	And I want you to hit a note higher than you've ever hit in this entire show.
4346520	4357520	From volcanic mounts of mist, nestled in gondors' shores,
4357520	4366520	the butts a lot, clan majesty spread forever through the fields,
4366520	4374520	and the heart of Zaraan himself couldn't bring the skies to horn.
4374520	4382520	But the swords and steel and horses' hides make brew inside the storm
4382520	4390520	and the heart of the mountain makes the butts a lot's heart twice as strong.
4390520	4396520	And if you want my steel inside you, don't do me wrong
4396520	4404520	because my father's father's horse groomsman was a mightier man than thee.
4404520	4412520	And I'll poop the sun and oceans and I'll turn the skies to pee.
4412520	4416520	That's how I'm going to tell everybody. Thank you for coming.
4416520	4420520	We'll have a real adventure next week.
4420520	4422520	Next week is...
4422520	4426520	Well, next week apparently the skies turn to pee.
4426520	4430520	Ladies and gentlemen, Spencer, our dungeon master.
4430520	4431520	Good job.
4431520	4437520	Aaron McGathey recreating the role of mole rain, Santana, Savannah.
4437520	4441520	All of you wonderful people here, Julieta.
4441520	4445520	Also while we're at it, Katie Levine, our audio recording, Zach McKeever,

4453520	4455520	Once again, I'm Jeff Davis.
4455520	4459520	Hear it for Dan Harmon, the mayor of Harmon town.
4459520	4465520	Dan.
4465520	4469520	Dan.
4469520	4473520	Danadu.
4473520	4476520	Danadu.
4476520	4478520	Now we are here.
4478520	4481520	It's Danadu.
4481520	4486520	Danadu, your light and heart will shine.
4486520	4494520	Good night, you motherfucker.
4494520	4497520	We did it.
