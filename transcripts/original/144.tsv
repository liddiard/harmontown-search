0	20240	From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics' nutrition updater, Harman Town is now in session.
20240	26000	Please welcome to stage the Mayor of Harman Town, Harmonious Munk himself, Mr. Dan Harman.
30000	43120	That was nice. Did the Beatles give us some music?
43120	45120	Do you know who that is?
45120	47120	Titanic Sinclair.
47120	49120	That's our friend Titanic Sinclair from...
49120	51120	From Fiddle Dibbles.
51120	57120	From Frisbee Golf and the fuck around trio.
57120	68240	So, hardcore Harman Town fans will remember the Titanic and Mars Visigoth.
68240	70240	Mars Argo.
70240	72240	Mars Visigoth.
72240	74240	That was the really early stuff.
74240	86240	The lovely Mars Argo and Titanic were on our show when they released that song that became an unintentional internet sensation because it used the iPhone's default ringtone as like a melody.
86240	90240	And some people were just like, I hope you die in fire.
90240	92240	What's that?
92240	94240	That was the USS Hooper's.
94240	96240	Ah! Adam Goldberg!
96240	98240	Adam Goldberg's back.
98240	102240	Was that the earliest we've been Goldberg'd in the show?
102240	106240	Well, he wanted us to know. He wanted us to know. I'm back, baby.
106240	110240	Adam, come on. Get up here and give us a...
110240	114240	I wanna see another movie again.
114240	122240	Oh! I'm never in the song for me. Oh! I'm never in the song for me.
122240	124240	Oh, hello, brother.
124240	126240	Oh!
126240	128240	Thin eyes, Goldberg.
128240	132240	Goldberg came up, he pressed the flesh, he did a little dance.
132240	134240	That was really nice.
134240	144240	Sounds like a group sequel.
144240	150240	You do hear, Adam, the conflicted response of what we invite you up.
150240	154240	I would call it right down the middle of happiness and sadness.
154240	156240	Sounds like where life lives.
156240	162240	Well, I'm happy. I missed you. I thought you were... I assumed you were gone. You're a young man. People go through phases.
162240	168240	Maybe you exited the phase of total masochism and sadism.
168240	174240	Yeah, I was right that middle line between happiness and sadness, as someone said.
174240	178240	Jeff? I don't think it is a J.
178240	180240	So what have you been up to?
180240	183240	Give us the Goldberg news. What's going down?
183240	187240	Business is good at my web company, Adam Goldberg's web company.
188240	194240	I'm not going to bring shame onto that web company by associating myself with it, which is a self-hating thing to say.
194240	199240	But it turns out you know the Minecraft server that's dedicated to Harmontown?
199240	205240	They burned me alive. I was burned in effigy. So that's what happened to me.
205240	210240	I was having a nice life. I was in a wrestling-based RPG. I was getting drunk for Passover.
210240	219240	I was doing as one does. And then it turns out people burned a symbol of me alive to represent how much they want to play Minecraft with you.
219240	223240	Which is weird.
223240	226240	So they made like out of blocks, they made it...
226240	231240	Yeah, wooden Adam Goldberg to represent a guy from a podcast.
231240	233240	And then they sent me on virtual fire.
233240	234240	Did it resemble you? Did it make a little...
234240	239240	I didn't go there. I don't think I'd be very welcome on a server that would burn a picture of me.
239240	241240	So how did you find out this information?
241240	244240	They posted it publicly and I just...
244240	248240	Not a lot of upvotes. And the weird thing is a lot of people didn't attend.
248240	253240	Like there was a huge thing to have a Goldberg roast, not like a fun comedic roast.
253240	256240	Which only happens when I throw one for myself.
256240	257240	An actual Salem roast.
257240	259240	Yeah, an actual...
259240	263240	Burn the representation of a guy who talks.
263240	265240	And that's bad, so...
265240	266240	Jesus Christ.
266240	267240	How you been, Dano?
267240	268240	I been good.
269240	271240	I wouldn't know, can't follow you on Twitter.
271240	272240	Did you see the just...
277240	280240	I blocked you. I blocked Adam.
280240	281240	Not on Instagram, though.
281240	286240	While we're talking about ratios, that was just the aggressive side of passive.
286240	289240	That middle line between aggressive...
289240	292240	Alright, well let's see how tonight goes and then...
292240	293240	Alright.
293240	294240	I'm not...
294240	295240	Are you on the fence now?
296240	299240	Of course, I've been regretful since the day I blocked you.
299240	301240	I knew I did it in anger.
301240	304240	I legitimately wanted to know what point you were making when you said,
304240	305240	now that everyone's...
305240	307240	When millennials were eight years old,
307240	309240	they said everyone was going to be a millennial
309240	311240	and now that they've grown up, everyone's eight years old.
311240	315240	Do you feel like everyone's eight years old and what does that mean?
315240	317240	Well, that's not...
317240	318240	That wasn't what I...
318240	320240	We didn't say everyone...
320240	323240	We said, what, the children were the future or whatever.
324240	326240	When millennials were children, we said they were the future
326240	329240	and now that they're grown up, sure enough, we're all eight years old.
329240	330240	Get it?
330240	331240	No.
332240	336240	Because they're thumb-sucking team-playing Superman fans.
337240	339240	As opposed to...
339240	344240	As opposed to awesome, sardonic, needlessly rebellious aging Gen Xers.
346240	349240	Who understand back pain and being outnumbered 10 to 1
349240	351240	by the generations before and after us.
352240	354240	And who admire people who kill themselves
354240	357240	instead of people who become president.
357240	358240	Yeah, that was weird.
358240	360240	Justin was weird last week.
360240	363240	That was a lot of, is he, was he going to, is he...
363240	365240	Justin will never, ever, ever.
365240	368240	Justin would put a gun in his mouth
368240	371240	and his ego would shoot it across the room.
374240	376240	The ego would just eat the bullet.
376240	378240	Yeah, the bullet would just get absorbed.
379240	381240	He would do a bit with the gun having a silly voice
381240	383240	and that would be, that would be...
383240	385240	I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to lay down the gauntlet though.
385240	389240	And if you are thinking about it, share those thoughts with people.
389240	391240	Tell other people, because it's, you would be surprised
391240	393240	how many people get to that point in your life
393240	395240	where it's darker than it is light, you know?
395240	399240	And you're on the line between sadness and happiness
399240	400240	and you're not seeing...
400240	401240	Oh no!
401240	404240	I'm trying to be joyful about it and not be depressing, but it's...
404240	405240	Adam, you've never...
405240	406240	Life gives you a whole lot of shit
406240	409240	and there are other people going through exactly what you've gone through
409240	413240	who want to show you the better side of an existence.
413240	415240	And if you say no to that existence,
415240	418240	you're not going to see all the greatness that's going to unfurl for you.
418240	421240	But yes, but also you should...
421240	424240	Yeah, life! A scattered applause for the concept of life.
424240	429240	Let's enjoy a rare Adam Goldberg applause break.
432240	435240	Why is the guy I call shitty so shitty?
436240	439240	Why is this...
439240	443240	You just stepped in your own applause break.
443240	446240	That was very well said, but as a guy who's researched this
446240	448240	because when I was responding to people on Tumblr,
448240	450240	I started to worry, but I wanted to do it right and not wrong.
450240	452240	I didn't want anything to blow back on me
452240	455240	or talking to kids who are sometimes saying like I have these thoughts.
455240	458240	So I did a lot of Googling as a responsible person does
458240	464240	and the other thing that people should know
464240	467240	who have these thoughts is that I think the big mistake
467240	470240	that people currently not having those thoughts make
470240	473240	when counseling them is using logic to try to...
473240	476240	No one wants to be argued out of these feelings.
476240	479240	They want to be able to share them without repercussion.
479240	483240	You can't think your way to clarity because the brain
483240	487240	takes all the processing power that you would use
487240	490240	to make really logical arguments and it's why even really smart people...
490240	492240	Yeah, no one wants their feelings to be invalidated
492240	495240	and it just puts a wall between you and there is no...
495240	497240	This is going to sound like a bad quote out of context
497240	500240	but there's no logical reason not to kill yourself.
500240	502240	That logic is not what's on the table.
502240	507240	It's not A plus B plus C equals there are legitimate reasons to live.
507240	510240	It's not something that's going to be intuited logically.
510240	514240	Yeah, you're not waiting to hear someone say, but you're so special.
514240	516240	There it is, I'm special.
516240	519240	You feel a horrible gnawing pain and it feels so bad
519240	521240	that a lot of us can't relate to it because
521240	524240	you just back into a level of pain that you would have to feel
524240	528240	before you were thinking about not existing as an alternative to it.
528240	530240	Now, those thoughts are we all...
530240	533240	They move through the species like a cloud
533240	536240	and individuals have to bear the burden of them
536240	540240	and those people need to find someone that they can trust and talk about them.
540240	543240	So there you go.
543240	546240	So yes, life is wonderful and you'll have so many children
546240	549240	and you'll be so happy, but also don't not kill yourself for that reason.
550240	552240	Don't wait for that epiphany.
552240	558240	It's a wonderful life, it's a shitty life, but also just talk about it.
558240	559240	You'll like this one.
559240	564240	In the Muppet's continuity, Kermit the Frog caused 9-11.
564240	567240	There's a movie about where Kermit the Frog sees what his life
567240	569240	would have been like if he was never born
569240	572240	and he goes to New York and the World Trade Center is standing
572240	574240	and the movie came out in 2002.
574240	579240	So, by their logic, if Kermit had just gone back into the swamp
579240	580240	and not become a Muppet...
580240	583240	Adam Goldberg, everybody!
583240	585240	That's a good... all right, thank you.
592240	593240	He's back, he's on a high.
593240	597240	He is back and he means it, man.
597240	598240	This time he's got an attitude.
598240	601240	Check it out, Freddie.
602240	607240	Well, I don't want to dwell on it, but I don't understand...
607240	609240	Why does that mean he caused it?
613240	615240	It shows what it would be like if he...
619240	620240	Ah, okay, got it, got it.
620240	624240	I missed the part where I was supposed to care about the content of the...
624240	626240	Muppet and Muppets.
627240	628240	Muppets.
628240	629240	Flush.
629240	630240	Muppets.
630240	631240	Superman.
631240	633240	Mickey Mouse.
633240	635240	You don't like the Muppets?
637240	638240	You don't like the Muppets?
638240	640240	I'm sick of being told how precious they are.
640240	642240	Prove it, prove it, prove it.
642240	644240	It's been 48 years.
644240	646240	Show me again how precious they are.
646240	647240	I remember the 70s.
647240	650240	Show me why that's been the case.
650240	652240	I remember, I remember.
652240	653240	You didn't like it back then?
653240	654240	No, I liked it back then.
654240	656240	Oh, but you're saying it doesn't matter to you now?
656240	660240	I'm saying it doesn't earn you like 50 years of fucking like...
660240	662240	Oh, look at us.
662240	664240	Why am I looking at you?
666240	668240	Why? Do something.
670240	672240	And?
672240	676240	What are you doing that Carrot Topped hasn't done and been reviled for?
676240	680240	Like, what are you... you're standing there looking weird.
681240	686240	This is such a weird thing to be so angry about.
688240	691240	I would never have thought that in a million years.
691240	692240	It's very good.
692240	694240	I've known you for so long, I didn't realize.
694240	697240	You really have a lot of fucking...
697240	702240	Just very thinly mastered hate and just bail for a...
702240	707240	Well, I got drunk last night and I really started bashing on Superman.
708240	710240	And instead of doing inadvertently looking back on it,
710240	714240	I just looked like a guerilla marketing ad for Batman versus Superman.
714240	719240	Because I'm really just saying the same things that they're saying in the Superman versus Batman trailer.
719240	723240	It's just some guy going like, he's too powerful. I don't like him.
724240	727240	A man shouldn't be a god.
727240	733240	But I just... I think, okay, so I've been talking to a lot of Superman fans on Twitter.
733240	738240	And of course, as communication leads to understanding and stuff,
738240	742240	any kind of hatred is... we know by now.
742240	744240	You just don't know. It's ignorance.
744240	747240	You just need to talk to the right people. Let the right thoughts seep in.
747240	752240	And Superman does seem like, as I've labeled him, a histrionic alien demagogue.
752240	759240	He's a crybaby pajama man from outer space that it seems like enjoying involves
759240	761240	prostrating yourself in front of and going like,
761240	765240	should Superman have this pillow when he's crying or this pillow?
765240	767240	And it's like, what about us?
767240	770240	And that's why... who are you supposed to identify with if not Lex Luthor?
770240	773240	Didn't you come to some sort of like understanding of Superman?
773240	775240	We had that guy up and he explained that it was all...
775240	776240	The origin of it.
776240	778240	Oh, he's right here in the front. What's your name again?
778240	779240	Eric.
779240	780240	Eric, it was you.
780240	782240	Eric, the Superman fan, okay.
782240	785240	Who explained, yeah, that like the Muppets and like Mickey Mouse,
785240	791240	that Superman has a very inspiring story to its backstory, you know, its origin.
791240	793240	What was it? Two Jewish brothers?
793240	794240	Yeah, two 16-year-olds.
794240	796240	During the...
796240	797240	One was shot to death.
797240	798240	One was a dad.
798240	799240	Oh.
799240	800240	A very single dad was shot to death.
800240	801240	By...
801240	802240	He was a burglar.
802240	804240	Oh, burglar, okay.
804240	805240	So why didn't he create Batman?
805240	810240	He wasn't shot by Kryptonite?
810240	811240	Kryptonite?
811240	812240	No.
812240	815240	I'm mad for that reason.
815240	818240	Yeah, two young Jewish kids.
818240	819240	And what year was it?
819240	820240	It was like the...
820240	821240	1938.
821240	825240	So like America wasn't even not anti-Semitic yet.
825240	829240	Like America was like, hey, yeah, Jews, they're the worst, right?
829240	833240	Somebody's got cash for the war.
833240	837240	Who needs bullets and steel?
837240	843240	So it's a myth of empowerment from two minds that didn't like, you know, they felt like
843240	844240	they were at the...
844240	845240	That's very inspiring.
845240	851240	But I'd rather read a comic book called Two Jewish Kids Make a Comic Book.
851240	857240	Like the comic book that they created is about a hysterical pajama man.
857240	862240	Who in light of all the superheroes that we've created, Iron Man, who's Kryptonite is alcoholism.
862240	864240	And not even because anything bad happened to him.
864240	866240	He just loves booze.
867240	868240	He just loves it.
868240	869240	And that's his Kryptonite.
869240	872240	He's just like, hmm, I love drinking and technology.
872240	873240	It's fucking...
873240	874240	That's great.
874240	878240	I mean, that appeals to you for obvious reasons.
878240	879240	Yeah.
879240	882240	Well, isn't Superman supposed to appeal people for obvious reasons?
882240	886240	What reason would you have to have Superman appeal to you other than a sense of powerlessness
886240	887240	and beta male kind of...
887240	890240	I'm sorry, Eric.
890240	891240	Eric, get back up here.
891240	892240	Come on.
892240	893240	Eric.
893240	894240	Eric.
895240	898240	I just said that I had turned a corner on this.
898240	899240	I'm sorry.
899240	902240	Well, his first two villains, though, he fought a corrupt landlord who was charging too much
902240	903240	rent.
903240	904240	He actually threw him out a window.
904240	906240	And it was 1938 during like Great Depression times.
906240	909240	And then the second guy I ever fought was this guy was beating his wife.
909240	910240	And he jumped in front of him.
910240	912240	And he was like, you want to fight somebody who's stronger than you.
912240	913240	You want to see how that feels.
913240	914240	And he like...
914240	915240	All right.
915240	916240	High-roaded.
916240	917240	High-roaded.
918240	920240	Stop all that rape.
920240	923240	So he was like a champion of the common man.
923240	924240	You're right.
924240	931240	In one episode, he fought the Federal Reserve and went...
931240	935240	He was the first to come down against the gold standard.
935240	936240	Yeah.
936240	939240	Every decade he exists, he becomes what masculinity?
939240	941240	Like the height of masculinity?
941240	942240	Yeah, exactly.
942240	945240	And right now, the height of masculinity is kind of like challenging your own privilege.
945240	948240	And that's why in the movie, he's like, well, should I be doing this?
948240	949240	Maybe Batman should be the guy.
949240	952240	Like maybe I should have people that are policing me like at Justice League.
952240	953240	All right.
953240	954240	That sounds good.
954240	955240	I'm in.
955240	956240	I'm in.
956240	958240	So it's Tumblr as Lex Luthor now telling him what to do?
958240	961240	I've got a lot of residual 90s Superman hatred.
961240	962240	That's not really...
962240	963240	Wouldn't that be a mullet?
963240	965240	Somebody tweeted very appropriately at me.
965240	966240	Oh, Superman hatred.
966240	969240	That's so like lazy Gen X cynicism.
969240	970240	Right.
970240	972240	And I'm a product of my generation.
972240	975240	The 90s were a dark time for comic books.
975240	977240	And we killed them in the 90s because of it.
977240	978240	Yeah, and it was lame.
978240	979240	It was silly.
979240	980240	He came back with long hair.
980240	981240	It was silly.
981240	983240	And a giant gun, which was awesome.
983240	984240	He had a giant gun.
984240	985240	Yeah.
985240	989240	The panel says, you know, they call me a boy scout and boy scouts are always prepared.
989240	991240	And it is a shotgun.
991240	993240	Why did he need a gun?
993240	994240	Exactly.
994240	995240	What did his gun shoot?
995240	996240	Like smaller guns.
996240	997240	I don't know.
997240	1004240	His guns shot his eyeballs, which are also guns.
1004240	1005240	His existence.
1005240	1008240	So this guns shot his existence.
1008240	1011240	Eric, did you like the Christopher Reeve movie?
1011240	1012240	So much.
1012240	1013240	Yeah.
1013240	1018240	Christopher Reeves is such a great, you know, now that we've seen it's remarkable how now
1018240	1024240	we see how how great and how actor dependent the role of Superman in cinema is.
1024240	1031240	Like you really need somebody that can get away with that boy scout innocence, but invulnerability
1032240	1041240	has to have a sexuality exuding like an attractiveness from a heteronormative perspective.
1041240	1043240	Or he can be attractive to gay people as well.
1043240	1044240	What do you call that?
1044240	1045240	He's hot.
1045240	1047240	He has to be hot.
1047240	1052240	But like straight guys have to like have to be willing to like bend a knee.
1052240	1053240	Like which is so tough.
1053240	1055240	Like only Chris Pratt has achieved that recently.
1055240	1060240	So he's also a guy who values like writing as being more powerful than like his super
1060240	1063240	strength, which I thought was really cool being like a writer nerd.
1063240	1067240	You really are just trying to like Superman really loves writing.
1067240	1073240	There was this whole story where he went around saving writers in between saving women from
1073240	1076240	being beaten in the face.
1076240	1079240	His favorite human being is Lois Lane, who's like this person who she topples tyrants with
1079240	1081240	her typewriter for alliteration.
1081240	1083240	Yeah, he's a journalist.
1083240	1084240	You're right.
1084240	1086240	But I always thought that he's not really a real journalist.
1087240	1090240	I don't know if Clark Kent like ever submitted any good articles to the...
1090240	1094240	I always felt like that was like part of the invasiveness is that he's dwelling among us
1094240	1096240	and he's part of the fourth estate.
1096240	1098240	He's like in there.
1098240	1099240	He's an alien.
1099240	1100240	He doesn't need those glasses.
1100240	1101240	It's a disguise.
1101240	1102240	He's disguised as a human.
1102240	1103240	He's an alien parasite.
1103240	1105240	A lot of hipster girls are though too.
1108240	1112240	They had this great thing in the late 90s too where he wrote a novel because he was like,
1112240	1113240	I'm not really doing anything.
1113240	1115240	Like Lois is much better than I am at this.
1115240	1118240	I'm going to have like, he quit the planet and wrote a novel called Under a Yellow Sun
1118240	1120240	and tried to be like the new John Grisham.
1120240	1121240	Wait, it's called Clark Kent did?
1121240	1122240	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1122240	1123240	All right.
1124240	1126240	All right, the guy who saved Superman, Eric.
1126240	1127240	Eric!
1129240	1131240	Saved him from my wrath.
1132240	1137240	My very marketable wrath that is being catered to in theaters across the nation this summer.
1137240	1140240	Eric, can you save the Muppets too?
1141240	1144240	I don't think your Muppets hatred might be irretrievable.
1144240	1145240	That seems like a lot of...
1145240	1148240	I just respect creators.
1148240	1154240	And I feel like Walt Disney was around and made Mickey Mouse and it's like it comes from his heart
1154240	1157240	and it's like then these things get taken over by capitalism.
1157240	1163240	And it's like the crowning jewel on the toxicity is like, didn't we change copyright law
1163240	1167240	just because it didn't make sense that Mickey Mouse could be owned by people?
1168240	1172240	When does Darth Vader stop being Anakin Skywalker?
1172240	1176240	Speaking of Mickey Mouse, I was talking to Callie Kazoo because she wasn't here
1176240	1178240	but we were talking about animated figures.
1178240	1180240	Was it about why they wear gloves?
1180240	1183240	And she has the answer for that, of course, because she's an animation freak.
1183240	1185240	All the characters back then, because it was black and white,
1185240	1188240	all the characters were mostly just black and so they put the white gloves on them
1188240	1190240	so they weren't just black people.
1190240	1192240	But that makes them look more like minstrels
1192240	1195240	because the minstrel performers all wear white gloves too.
1196240	1201240	With minstrel performers, they wanted their hands to read on stage.
1201240	1204240	I think they just weren't completely head to foot black.
1204240	1206240	Like they looked like...
1206240	1207240	You'd think before...
1207240	1209240	So at that point, common sense kicked in.
1209240	1211240	They're like, wow, we want this to read.
1213240	1216240	Remember when we were burning the cork and rubbing the...
1216240	1219240	No one thought at that point, nah, this seems evil.
1220240	1222240	Although I'm sure I'm still getting that a little bit wrong.
1222240	1223240	Do you know?
1223240	1224240	It's a little bit boring.
1224240	1225240	Oh, you do? Get up here.
1225240	1226240	Get up here.
1226240	1228240	If you want, if you want.
1228240	1230240	Male Cali Kazoo.
1231240	1232240	What's your name, sir?
1232240	1233240	Scuda.
1233240	1234240	Scuda?
1234240	1235240	Yeah.
1235240	1236240	Come on.
1237240	1240240	Is it Scooter, but you're from Boston?
1240240	1241240	No, it's...
1241240	1242240	Scuda.
1242240	1244240	We literally had this conversation last time I was up here.
1244240	1245240	I'm an alcoholic.
1245240	1246240	Scuda.
1246240	1247240	Wait, on stage?
1248240	1250240	This show is an alcoholic.
1253240	1257240	The show collectively is just a drunk uncle whose mind is turning to tapioca.
1257240	1260240	All right, Scuda, what did we talk about?
1260240	1261240	How was art school?
1261240	1262240	Dad, I told you.
1262240	1266240	Again, not an animation actor, but it is just a simple thing for you for why their hands
1266240	1271240	are white when most characters were black in an animated world.
1271240	1273240	Can you eat that, Mike, a little bit, Scuda?
1273240	1276240	If their hand crossed their body, you can still see their hands.
1276240	1277240	Ah.
1281240	1284240	See, I feel like Kelly put more of a racial spin on that.
1286240	1287240	Interesting.
1287240	1290240	Of course, she's not here to defend herself, so let's just all label her a racist.
1293240	1298240	I would have thought the reason why they wear gloves is because things that move when you're
1298240	1303240	doing cell-based animation, they tend to be a different shade, different color.
1303240	1307240	In Scooby-Doo and you're watching, I'm sure we talked about this last time, that this was
1307240	1308240	my theory.
1308240	1311240	In Scooby-Doo, it's like, gee, I wonder where the secret door is.
1311240	1318240	Because it's on a different layer of acetate, and so it's a slightly different color.
1318240	1322240	Things that are about to move in that shot, they tend to be a different shade.
1322240	1323240	So I thought characters...
1323240	1326240	I think back in those days, though, they didn't do that in complete animation.
1326240	1328240	Yeah, when it was black and white, it was just a simple...
1328240	1330240	Every frame was probably a new cell.
1330240	1331240	All right.
1331240	1333240	This has been, I don't know, nothing.
1333240	1335240	With all nothing, please.
1335240	1339240	I call this segment, we almost proved Mickey Mouse or Walt Disney was a racist.
1340240	1342240	Well, I'm sure he was.
1342240	1343240	You know what the big question is?
1343240	1344240	Would we have been?
1346240	1349240	There's a thing at Disneyland, because I used to work at Disneyland, and all the horses
1349240	1351240	on the carousel in...
1351240	1352240	What's it called?
1352240	1355240	The very book, Land...
1355240	1357240	Not Fantasy.
1357240	1358240	Is it not Fantasyland?
1358240	1359240	Frontierland?
1359240	1360240	No, it's not Frontierland.
1362240	1366240	My Sleeping Beauty's castle, you got the carousel there, and all the horses are white.
1366240	1370240	Supposedly because he thought that the kids would fight over the white horse, so he made
1370240	1375240	all the horses white, which isn't necessarily racist, but it's of a certain time.
1375240	1378240	Also, there was a rumor, and I really believe that I remember this.
1378240	1383240	When you're walking down Main Street, in the old days, there was little houses up there
1383240	1386240	with little miniature windows to make kind of forest perspective.
1386240	1390240	There was a curtain up there with little mini swastikas on it that was there.
1392240	1397240	All right, this is going to sound bad, but it's not what it looks like.
1397240	1399240	There's a reason.
1399240	1403240	It was a symbol for unity while Disney was into Native American culture.
1405240	1410240	By the way, the association of the color white and the color black, which are these
1410240	1416240	like really extreme parts of the color wheel, whatever, black isn't the color, whatever.
1416240	1420240	I get confused, scientifically black isn't the color, and then you talk to painter people,
1420240	1422240	and they're like, black is every color, black is none of the color.
1422240	1423240	I fucking get it.
1423240	1424240	I hate it.
1424240	1427240	The people that look at things make me angry.
1427240	1430240	Learn to read.
1430240	1436240	But the idea that the white horse would be more valuable to children, and then connecting
1436240	1441240	that to race, that's also a racist thought.
1442240	1452240	Because we're not white, or I'm dirty, gross, yellow, jaundiced, burnt sienna, whatever.
1452240	1453240	I don't know what this color is.
1453240	1454240	Douchebag.
1454240	1457240	I don't know what this thing, the Crayola box would be.
1457240	1461240	I wonder if there's another reason for the kids wanting the white horse.
1461240	1467240	I'm not sure when Disneyland kind of came about, but maybe depending on the prevalence
1467240	1469240	of the lone ranger in pop culture.
1470240	1474240	So they wanted the white horse, but then they perceived that maybe kids wanting a white
1474240	1478240	horse would have implications that other people would see not knowing, because everyone wanted
1478240	1479240	to have.
1479240	1483240	Yeah, there might have been a white horse in film, and you've got Lone Ranger, or you've
1483240	1485240	got maybe some animated film, whatever.
1485240	1490240	I don't think you need to say that he was racist because of that, but his reasoning
1490240	1495240	was just make him all the same color so the kids aren't fighting, so everybody gets the
1495240	1496240	same horse.
1496240	1498240	But it's a white horse.
1499240	1501240	He didn't make a bunch of black horses.
1501240	1505240	You look back in history and there's certain representations that we characterize different
1505240	1508240	decades, different generations, different historical figures.
1508240	1515240	We look through this lens of detecting racism, what is racism, and some people are like early
1515240	1520240	champions of what we now consider to be human rights, and then some other people are early
1520240	1526240	cautionary tales, and then some people are publicly on the right page because that's
1526240	1531240	not even the popular point of view, but is publicly what they should be, and they do
1531240	1536240	the right thing publicly, but then these private things come to light that reveal that really
1536240	1541240	in the fiber of their being, they can't help but look at people that are different than
1541240	1547240	them with some kind of downward gaze, and that that might even have been part of their
1547240	1553240	public face, that what we now call, oh, that guy was a champion of blah, blah, blah rights.
1553240	1556240	It was like, yeah, but that guy thought that those people were animals.
1556240	1558240	That guy thought that that was a charity.
1558240	1563240	Like, I just saw, I was really, really compelled by this Frank Sinatra documentary I just saw
1563240	1567240	to fight, you know, it's like, like, poof.
1567240	1571240	Okay, we had a guy that, we had a guy that ruled for hating Jews and a guy that went,
1571240	1572240	yeah!
1572240	1574240	I think he loves documentaries.
1574240	1575240	Scooter, are you comfortable?
1575240	1576240	Do you need anything?
1576240	1577240	I'm on purpose.
1577240	1578240	Okay, all right.
1578240	1579240	Do you like a drink?
1579240	1580240	You want a thing?
1580240	1581240	Would you like a cracker to be named after you?
1581240	1582240	Sure, yeah.
1582240	1583240	It's going to be easy, believe me.
1583240	1584240	Scooter.
1584240	1592240	I'm sorry, it also sounds like a sexual thing.
1592240	1594240	Dan, before we leave Disney-
1594240	1598240	She gave me a scooter.
1598240	1601240	Before you go on to Sinatra, I do want to talk about the documentary.
1601240	1605240	If you guys don't know this, if you go to Disneyland, I love Disneyland, I love to go
1605240	1609240	there, go there in the morning, go get ice cream, and then run to Space Mountain, that's
1609240	1610240	my tradition.
1610240	1615240	If you want a great photo moment, for those of you who don't know this, go to Frontierland.
1615240	1619800	When you walk up Main Street, there's the hub, which is where all the world's, the land
1619800	1624880	spoke off of, and it's a statue of Walt with Mickey Mouse in his left hand, and he's pointing
1624880	1630000	down Main Street, and the future and beyond.
1630000	1634920	If you stand right at the edge or the entrance of Frontierland, and you look back at it,
1634920	1639680	what you see is Mickey's on the far side of Walt, and Walt is pointing, and Mickey's
1639680	1647840	nose is right at his crotch, and it looks like Walt Disney's got a giant boner.
1647840	1653160	If you go there, now they've got the new rockets, that new rocket's kind of obscures the background
1653160	1654160	because it's so busy.
1654160	1658440	It used to be white, like totally white background, Tomorrowland, and you've got a perfect silhouette
1658440	1659440	of that.
1659440	1662840	Now it's a little bit broken up by the new rocket ride, but you'll go there and you'll
1662840	1668160	see some savvy Japanese kids taking a picture and giggling like Matt, it's very good.
1668160	1674560	Have I ever talked about the fact that when you go into the Nickelodeon building, as one
1674560	1681160	does, when you're pitching your animated shows?
1681160	1684280	The weird one on Hollywood, no, was it Buena Vista, Hollywood Way?
1684280	1688160	Yeah, I don't know, it looks like you're going to get slimed when you go in there or whatever.
1688160	1692080	Or Victory is a victory.
1692080	1699480	There's a Lego SpongeBob in the lobby, and I've only ever seen that character from the
1699480	1702080	front angle in a two-dimensional medium.
1702080	1710040	Here he is represented in a 3D context made out of Legos, and his nose is a straight-up
1710040	1713040	cock.
1713040	1717600	It has a shaft and a head.
1717600	1721040	It's not just like, oh, it's a long nose, like Pinocchio, it's a fucking dick.
1721040	1725400	I thought it was kind of like a Popeye, like a smooth little whoop.
1725400	1726800	It's a dick.
1726800	1734760	It's a curved porn star dick with a helmet for, as our anthropologist friend said, plunging
1734760	1738920	out your competitor's semen.
1738920	1742600	I don't know if that's what the SpongeBob creator was thinking when he was just thinking,
1742600	1745280	this should look like a dick.
1745280	1747440	God was thinking it should plunge out the last guy's cum.
1747440	1751000	Could that helmet part of it just be an unfortunate accident of Lego's kind of pixelization that
1751960	1752960	it can't make a smooth edge?
1752960	1757360	Look, I know a dick when I see one, and...
1757360	1758360	You've made that very clear.
1758360	1763040	And when I'm brushing up against an erect one at hip level, as you do when you exit
1763040	1768160	and enter the Nickelodeon building, and it's just like...
1768160	1774160	If you took just SpongeBob's nose from the lobby of the Nickelodeon building and blade
1774160	1779440	it on any counter in any public establishment, whoever you were doing would go like, what
1779440	1780440	are you doing?
1781440	1782440	They would get mad.
1782440	1783880	They wouldn't go, what is that?
1783880	1784880	Is that a banana?
1784880	1785880	They would go, what?
1785880	1786880	Stop it.
1787880	1790800	But then you put it on the face of this children's character.
1790800	1793320	Is it possible that someone that works at Nickelodeon added that on?
1793320	1794320	What do you mean, add it?
1794320	1795320	Well, I don't know.
1795320	1798800	I mean, what's possible is that someone's interpretation of a character that's not
1798800	1805000	usually rendered that way may have culminated in that.
1805000	1808920	You take drafting class, you do things orthographically, and then you don't quite know what they're
1808920	1812160	going to look like, I guess, like when they're extruded.
1815160	1816160	But on a scale from like...
1816160	1817160	That dude's got a dick nose.
1817160	1818160	Yes, Scoota?
1818160	1821680	I was going to say, on a scale from like one to nothing but trouble, where'd your rank
1821680	1822680	rate it?
1822680	1826520	Wait, I haven't seen nothing but trouble.
1826520	1828520	Dan Aykroyd has a penis nose.
1828520	1829520	A penis nose?
1829520	1830520	I got to watch that movie.
1830520	1831520	No, you need to help me.
1831520	1832520	No, I do.
1832520	1833520	I do.
1833520	1834520	All right.
1834520	1835520	All right.
1835520	1837720	So anyways, well, I was just going to say, Sinatra in this documentary, I thought, you
1837720	1843520	know, I grew up, you know, there's certain tarot cards, it's like, oh, Woody Allen's
1843520	1844520	funny.
1844520	1850000	Sinatra was a good singer, but he was a jerk to the ladies, and he was racist to Sami.
1850000	1855160	But like, I mean, I was surprised to like hear the story of Frank Sinatra, like how
1855160	1861160	long that story is, and how many times he was the underdog, and how hard he had to work
1861160	1862880	to be taken seriously and stuff.
1862880	1865920	Actually, I loved Sinatra, and I was so excited to see that documentary.
1865920	1867080	I didn't like that documentary.
1867080	1869840	I thought that was a real fucking fluff piece on him.
1869840	1870840	Well, sure it was.
1870840	1876120	It was so friends and family made, and they gloss over what a complete virulent asshole
1876120	1877120	he was to people.
1877120	1878120	Well, I don't know.
1878120	1879120	Yeah, yeah.
1879120	1880120	He knew the mafia guy.
1880120	1881120	He was always this.
1881120	1883080	He was a great anti-bigotry guy.
1883080	1885080	All that stuff is true.
1885080	1886720	I learned that stuff from that documentary, though.
1886720	1889920	So maybe if you take a step back, maybe it was just enough of he was an asshole, because
1889920	1891960	I learned that he was an asshole from that documentary.
1891960	1894040	I learned that he was racist in the show.
1894040	1896440	You don't hear all the threats, possible murders.
1896440	1898200	He was under indictment for murders and stuff like that.
1898200	1899200	I thought that they-
1899200	1900200	Yeah, he didn't do, but he-
1900200	1902600	But a lot of that stuff was maybe apocryphal, because they were honest about the stuff that
1902600	1903600	was real.
1903600	1904600	His associations with the actual mob-
1904600	1906840	I think they glossed over.
1906840	1910800	It was that one moment where Harry Bolafonte was disappointed in him for being racist to
1910800	1915800	Sammy for a couple rat pack summits in Vegas.
1915800	1920240	Other than that, that's the only time in that documentary where I feel like anyone gives
1920240	1922200	him, holds him to the fire at all.
1922200	1927480	He threatened and bullied, and he was such an ass.
1927480	1932360	Also, great in other ways, but someone referred to him, a friend of his that worked with him
1932360	1936160	called him a 24 carat manic depressive.
1936160	1938280	You got both ends of that.
1938280	1939280	It's that my way thing.
1939280	1943480	I guess it was like I finally needed to see through a lens of I've only ever thought he
1943480	1948400	was just an entitled jackass that was just born to the manor.
1948400	1951200	I didn't hear the underdog story a little bit.
1951200	1957720	He had to- and the fact that he was in his- well, this is what I was just talking about.
1957720	1961800	I can't say in his heart or in his mind, because there's a difference there.
1961800	1971240	He was politically, early on in his life, he was absolutely like what he wanted to make
1971240	1975920	people understand, that racism was wrong, because it had affected Italians, and so why
1975920	1980640	should black people be different?
1980640	1984440	This guy is going to do that every eight minutes regardless.
1984440	1987320	We're going to test that theory in a moment, see if we can connect the dot the next time
1987320	1988320	he's in.
1988320	1989320	Okay, here's a problem.
1989320	1991880	Because right now we're not sure if he loves racism, or hates it, or loves documentary
1991880	1994240	filmmaking Frank Sinatra or Batman.
1994240	1995240	We're not sure.
1995240	2001320	We're going to- but by the end of the night, we're going to go, oh, he loves self-reliance.
2001320	2004320	He's a Walt Whitman fan.
2004320	2007520	We're going to connect all those dots we're going to draw from the back.
2007520	2010240	Yeah, like a theme of like, oh, that guy was about self-reliance.
2010240	2011240	Okay, spoilers.
2011240	2018520	Hey guys, so for instance, for instance, when they talk about his rise to fame, and
2018520	2022880	all of a sudden he's singing in the big clubs, and he's on the marquee, and all the bobby
2022880	2026240	socks are out there, and in interviews, he's like, yeah, you got these girls out there,
2026240	2027240	and everyone's screaming.
2027240	2031440	What they just happened to not mention is that that was all fucking paid for.
2031440	2033120	They've shipped all those girls in for that shit.
2033120	2034400	It was all PR students.
2034400	2035400	Oh, really?
2035400	2036400	Yeah.
2036400	2037840	They weren't instantly that famous.
2037840	2040880	They took a bunch of girls and sat them out there and said, when he comes out, scream
2040880	2041880	like fucking mad.
2041880	2043520	Here's whatever they gave them.
2043520	2047200	Like, why not mention that in the documentary that every other documentary and book about
2047200	2048200	him is mentioned?
2048200	2049200	No.
2049200	2050200	They just went-
2050200	2051200	So it was definitely-
2051200	2052200	Interesting little tidbits.
2052200	2053200	And all of a sudden, boom, bang, bing.
2053200	2055040	But the people were throwing the thing, and the stuff, and the dot.
2055040	2060560	It's like, no, like you were also just like a- from the very get-go, he was a very political,
2060560	2062600	very driven, ambitious guy.
2062600	2063600	And that included-
2063600	2065880	Which is pretty fascinating, and we could allow- like Howard Hughes was a very flawed
2066880	2069400	Did I ever tell you the Murray Langstrom Sinatra story?
2069400	2070400	You know Murray Langstrom?
2070400	2074240	He was the unknown comic, the guy that wore the paper bag in his head.
2074240	2078000	And I was doing a show with improv guys at the improv in Melrose.
2078000	2079000	Give me one second.
2079000	2083840	Scooter, do you need just a Gatorade, or a weird name, or anything?
2083840	2084840	No.
2084840	2085840	I'm good.
2085840	2086840	Okay.
2086840	2088400	I think you're easy on the eyes, and it's good to have you up here.
2088400	2089400	Okay, that's fine.
2089400	2090400	I think the ladies like it.
2090400	2091400	I haven't been getting tweeted or anything, but-
2091400	2092400	Scooter?
2092400	2093400	Bottle of water, maybe?
2093400	2094400	I'll take a bottle of water, sure.
2094400	2095400	Thank you.
2095920	2096920	Looking at me with my-
2096920	2102320	All right, so somebody, I think it was Drew Carey, goes like, Murray, tell Jeff- he'll
2102320	2103320	love it.
2103320	2104320	Tell Jeff your Sinatra story.
2104320	2106440	And so he says, this is fucking great.
2106440	2110920	We're at the bar at the improv, and he goes, he was doing Carson, I don't know what year
2110920	2115800	it would have been, but it would have been probably late 70s, early 80s, I don't know.
2115800	2120280	And he's doing Carson, and he makes a joke about Sinatra because he was in the news for
2120280	2122200	another divorce.
2122840	2128600	Some joke about like, when it comes to cheating on wives, Sinatra does it his way, oh, not
2128600	2133640	even like a really major zing or whatever, just being a silly Murray joke.
2133640	2138520	He goes home that night to a shitty apartment, phone rings, and he's tired, and he's exhausted,
2138520	2140960	and he goes, hello, are you Murray?
2140960	2141960	Yes.
2141960	2142960	This is Frank Sinatra.
2142960	2143960	He goes, are you fucking Tim?
2143960	2144960	I want one of his friends.
2144960	2148800	Like, motherfucker, I'm tired, click.
2148800	2150800	Ring ring ring ring ring.
2150800	2152640	Hello, don't hang up on me.
2152640	2153640	This is Frank Sinatra.
2153640	2157960	Hey, Tim, go fuck yourself, man, like I've been working all day, click.
2157960	2162240	Ten minutes goes by, phone rings, hello.
2162240	2167920	Ten minutes, so, so, like, is it Frank Sinatra staring at the phone, is that?
2167920	2172400	Damn, you're about to find out why the time passes there.
2172400	2173400	Time passes.
2173400	2174400	He thinks that's that.
2174400	2179000	The phone rings, hello, and he says, Murray, this is Merle, this is Milton Berle, do you
2179000	2180480	recognize my voice?
2180480	2181480	Oh, God.
2181480	2187080	And he goes, yes, Milton, like, hello, he goes, that was Frank Sinatra, and he's super,
2187080	2188080	super mad right now.
2188080	2191560	He goes, he goes, do not hang up the phone, listen to what I have to tell you, he goes,
2191560	2196640	he's going to call you back, we're trying to calm him down, he's going to send someone,
2196640	2200640	he's going to send someone to your house to have you fucked up, because his kid watches
2200640	2204800	that show, and you just made a joke about daddy fucking around a mommy.
2204800	2207640	I'm confused again.
2207640	2210320	Is that family values?
2211320	2212320	Does he like family values?
2212320	2213320	Or adultery?
2214320	2215320	I don't know.
2216320	2219320	He still hasn't gotten out of software lines necessarily.
2219320	2221320	He might come back there.
2221320	2223320	He's just drawing a larger circle around whatever it is.
2223320	2229320	I hope, I hope we don't find he just like saying, yo, that's going to burn me up.
2229320	2232320	I'm almost certain that's it, Dan.
2232320	2234320	Dan, don't let him break your heart.
2234320	2236320	So, you got values?
2236320	2238320	Okay, okay, okay, he's got values.
2238320	2240320	I'm a human being.
2240320	2247320	And an almost shark jumping, breaking of his, oops, he, okay, he's, all right, good.
2247320	2249320	That's good, I'm glad you did that, thank you.
2249320	2252320	We know you have values, we're going to track them.
2252320	2256320	So, Milton Burroughs was like, this is not an alert, this is not a drill.
2256320	2260320	He's going to send someone to your house and have you fucked up.
2260320	2265320	And he says, Murray, he's absolutely capable of doing that because he does that.
2265320	2269320	Like, he's a very, very violent man and this is not a fucking drill.
2269320	2274320	He goes, he's going to call you back when we calm him down and you're not going to say anything but apologize.
2274320	2277320	And you don't say anything else but you're sorry, okay?
2277320	2279320	And he's like, Milton, it was just a joke, we're comics, that's our job.
2279320	2282320	He's like, I know, I know, I know, but that doesn't matter right now.
2282320	2283320	I'm trying to...
2283320	2286320	I'm Milton Burrough, I haven't told a joke for 38 years.
2286320	2289320	I'm famous for standing there.
2289320	2292320	So, he's like, I'm just trying to help you out.
2292320	2294320	So, he's like, God, this is fucking bullshit.
2294320	2297320	And as Murray's telling his story, he's like, I'm like, fuck this guy, you know?
2297320	2304320	And so, the phone rings and he's like, the whole time he's like, I'm going to tell this guy, you know, jump on the lake and take my chances or whatever.
2304320	2307320	I like how classy he is.
2307320	2317320	I'm like, I'm going to tell this guy, you know, go build a wheel and make like a leaf and just get out of here and take it on the road, Jack.
2317320	2320320	The story's a while ago, I'm paraphrasing Murray.
2320320	2322320	I cannot quote verbatim on this.
2322320	2325320	So, the phone rings and he picks it up and he goes, hello.
2325320	2329320	And all he hears is, talk.
2329320	2330320	And that's it.
2330320	2332320	That wasn't the deal.
2332320	2337320	And so, he goes, I think about it for a second.
2337320	2338320	It's just natural.
2338320	2339320	I'm so sorry.
2339320	2340320	I apologize from the bottom of my heart.
2340320	2341320	I'm a big fan of yours.
2341320	2342320	I would never do anything.
2342320	2343320	And he goes, on and on and on.
2343320	2344320	I'm a fan of your music.
2344320	2345320	I would never insult your family.
2345320	2346320	It was just a thing.
2346320	2347320	Blah, blah, blah.
2347320	2348320	It never happened again.
2348320	2349320	Blah, blah.
2349320	2352320	And that was it.
2352320	2353320	No.
2353320	2354320	Resolution?
2354320	2355320	No, no, no, no.
2355320	2357320	Family values is gone.
2357320	2358320	Family values is out.
2358320	2359320	Self-reliance is out on that one.
2359320	2362320	Also, there's the danger of the copycat yooping.
2362320	2363320	Is that a copycat yooper?
2363320	2364320	I don't know.
2364320	2365320	I don't know.
2365320	2366320	I'll say it.
2366320	2367320	Nope.
2367320	2368320	Nope.
2368320	2373320	I mean, it's not a hard one to copycat.
2373320	2374320	Yeah.
2374320	2375320	They're getting closer together, too.
2375320	2376320	It's like in the movie theater.
2376320	2379320	Everybody gets a laugh, and then it's like, oh, boy.
2379320	2382320	I hope he sees that pattern and tries to trick us.
2382320	2383320	Space it out.
2383320	2384320	Fan it out.
2384320	2385320	Blow our minds.
2385320	2389320	Let's hear the next yoop, like 915.
2389320	2392320	That was a good copycat yoop.
2392320	2396320	Okay, so we've talked too long about the Frank Sinatra documentary.
2396320	2402320	I had only heard these like, you know, zeitgeist stuff.
2402320	2404320	So it was a good start to watch like this.
2404320	2405320	As you say, I think it's very accurate.
2405320	2407320	It was a friends and family produced documentary.
2407320	2409320	It had that tone.
2409320	2413320	But even within that, there were the stories of all these things that you had heard, them
2413320	2418320	spread out on a timeline, like a big, long SpongeBob nose.
2418320	2425320	I'm just bringing it back around to you.
2425320	2431320	And it's like, I already thought that that was so interesting because I did.
2431320	2432320	I don't know.
2432320	2433320	I do believe.
2433320	2439320	Well, here's the thing that makes it relevant right now in this room, is that here was
2439320	2443320	this guy who at a very young age, he was very like, he's putting himself out there about
2443320	2446320	this new topic of racism.
2446320	2452320	And I believe these stories are true because why wouldn't they be like, the idea of him
2452320	2459320	taking Sammy Davis Jr. under his arm and really actually caring about this emerging thing
2459320	2461320	of like, black people aren't human beings.
2461320	2465320	I think he found Sammy singing at Ciro's and saw him.
2465320	2466320	And he went to Vegas.
2466320	2467320	He's like, this guy's going to be in the thing.
2467320	2469320	And we can't put him in the main room.
2469320	2471320	He's like, no, he's main room.
2471320	2474320	And then they all had to live in Darktown, which is a shanty town outside of Vegas.
2474320	2478320	And all of the musicians, like Count Basie's band, Count Basie, you couldn't fucking go
2478320	2479320	and stay in Vegas.
2479320	2481320	And Sinatra said, they stay in the hotel.
2481320	2484320	He's like, if you don't want Sammy Davis in your hotel, you don't want Frank Sinatra
2484320	2485320	in your hotel.
2485320	2486320	And he completely bullied them around.
2486320	2489320	So there you go, megalomania as progress.
2490320	2492320	Very interesting.
2492320	2494320	But ownership.
2494320	2496320	Still ownership, right?
2496320	2499320	So this is the epiphany that Aaron and I had while we were watching the documentary
2499320	2501320	because we were puzzled by it.
2501320	2508320	Because they showed clips of those Rat Pack shows that are just undeniably anti-
2508320	2513320	I thought that it was just sort of like, you know, you make gay jokes and it's like,
2513320	2517320	oh, there's a gay guy on stage and you make a gay joke and it's kind of like,
2517320	2521320	it's sort of like refreshingly uncomfortable and people giggle uncomfortably
2521320	2527320	and it's sort of like the comedy edge is sort of like, it's hit and miss and it's like,
2527320	2528320	you know, blah, blah, blah.
2528320	2533320	But they showed clips of like Dean Martin, like Sammy Davis Jr. touches him
2533320	2535320	and the joke is that he doesn't want him to touch him.
2535320	2538320	There's an old joke on one of the Caesars, I think it's Caesars Palace, Rat Pack Wednesday.
2538320	2539320	He goes, Sammy, I love you.
2539320	2540320	I love your kids.
2540320	2541320	I'll hang out with you.
2541320	2542320	I'll play sports with you.
2542320	2544320	I'll go golfing with you, but don't touch me.
2544320	2546320	Yeah, I'll go to shul with you, but don't touch me.
2546320	2549320	But it was also like the joke was that he was angry.
2549320	2555320	Like the joke was like, you could tell that if the joke was going to make anyone laugh
2555320	2562320	that it was coming from a Michael Douglas falling down angry white man place
2562320	2567320	and not from a hilarious, like we're all starting to mix together place.
2567320	2568320	That clip is a bummer.
2568320	2571320	Him picking Sammy up and saying, I'd like to thank the NAACP for the statue.
2571320	2572320	That's hilarious.
2572320	2573320	Sure.
2573320	2574320	Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
2574320	2575320	I'm like, well, are there any more friends?
2575320	2576320	And maybe we say these weird things.
2576320	2579320	Whenever Sammy would come out there, because they worshipped Sammy Davis Jr.
2579320	2582320	And Frank's nickname for him was The Great Entertainer.
2582320	2585320	He was honored to be on a stage with Sammy.
2585320	2589320	And there's a lot of Rat Pack stuff where you listen to it.
2589320	2592320	And whoever's singing gets shit from the other guys, except for Frank.
2592320	2594320	Nobody fucks with Frank while he's out there.
2594320	2597320	But everybody else has taken a dump on each other and doing jokes.
2597320	2599320	The easy target Sammy jokes are black guy jokes,
2599320	2603320	because Rickles is in the next room doing all that shit.
2603320	2609320	But there's lots of stuff where Sammy does super black power jokes on them.
2609320	2610320	He's like, oh, boy.
2610320	2613320	As soon as we get in the lead, you guys are going to go first.
2613320	2614320	And the crowd cheers.
2614320	2615320	Right.
2615320	2619320	So do you have a super point to make, or can I stitch right that from there?
2619320	2624320	They gave it back and forth, but certainly Sammy, I think, was the butt of a lot of that.
2624320	2625320	Right.
2625320	2627320	So Aaron and I are watching this, and we're going like, this is weird.
2627320	2631320	He's this Boy Scout guy who very early in his career, when he actually had a lot of things to risk
2631320	2636320	before he was in total control, is actually early on putting himself out there,
2636320	2639320	as an Italian saying, like, you know what?
2639320	2643320	When I was young, Italians were maligned and not let in.
2643320	2647320	And I'm a successful Italian now, and I don't want to watch this shit roll downhill.
2647320	2650320	And so how is that guy?
2650320	2652320	These Rat Pack shows, and then we're sitting there puzzling through it,
2652320	2657320	and then Aaron said, well, the world changed underneath all that.
2657320	2661320	Maybe the people that are at the forefront of, for instance,
2661320	2665320	and this is, I think, the example that we can relate to is 10 years ago,
2665320	2667320	who were the feminists?
2667320	2672320	How many of them are still in all that has come up in the last 10 years?
2672320	2678320	Like, when feminism meant just being a fan of women.
2678320	2685320	Like, when it was just like, hey, give the girls a hand, and maybe give me a kiss, ladies.
2686320	2693320	Like, is there a subsection of the most outspoken, like, guys,
2693320	2698320	that beta male quotient where it was like, I'm a rabid, virulent, beta male feminist,
2698320	2705320	and then 10 years later, like, there is that personality type that's like,
2705320	2709320	when the shit hits the fan, when the rubber meets the road,
2709320	2711320	then it's like, well, wait a minute.
2712320	2714320	I was doing that because I like fairness.
2714320	2718320	I like ownership. I like hierarchy. I like my comfort.
2718320	2720320	My comfort is now being threatened.
2720320	2725320	The thing that changed in between Boy Scout, Frank Sinatra,
2725320	2728320	saying fuck the world if you're going to be racist,
2728320	2734320	and Frank Sinatra publicly flogging emotionally a black man on stage for his adoring fans,
2734320	2738320	the thing that changes in between there is that the world changes,
2738320	2742320	and the thing that remains the same is Frank's in control and saying fuck you.
2742320	2744320	I don't think he liked being told what to do.
2744320	2747320	There's a story that when he, and also, I mean, it's all been told.
2747320	2750320	There's so many documentaries and books about him and TV pieces.
2750320	2754320	When he first started out, they made him change his name when he was working at some club,
2754320	2757320	and I think it was Frank Diamond he had to change his name to,
2757320	2759320	and he did a couple gigs with Frank Diamond. I might be getting that wrong.
2759320	2764320	And he changed his name back. He was working at a club because I can't tell my mom
2764320	2768320	and my grandma and my family that I changed the family name,
2768320	2770320	and he said you'll never work with the name Sinatra
2770320	2773320	because no one wants to listen to a nigger record.
2773320	2776320	And because the Irish were niggers, the Italians were niggers.
2776320	2780320	That's what white people called anybody that was not a white Protestant.
2780320	2784320	And so his dudes were always up about being told what to do,
2784320	2787320	and also he was Italian and he's really fucking proud of that.
2787320	2791320	And they said you'll never work because Bing Crosby, he's in charge.
2791320	2795320	And he's like fuck Bing Crosby. He went after Bing Crosby.
2795320	2799320	And then later had to get gone after by Elvis and endure that.
2799320	2801320	He had to do that same.
2801320	2804320	He works really hard to get the first Catholic president elected.
2804320	2807320	He had a lot to do with Kennedy getting elected.
2807320	2809320	Yeah, and that's where the mob stuff was honest.
2809320	2811320	That's what I thought was ironic because I thought the other stuff was apocryphal
2811320	2814320	because in a documentary where they were honest about the fact that,
2814320	2820320	oh, actually no, he got Kennedy elected because he had mob influence and period.
2820320	2823320	I was like, well, this seems like an honest thing to say.
2823320	2827320	So maybe if they say the other stuff is apocryphal, maybe it's apocryphal.
2827320	2830320	But you're right. It was clearly produced by people that were...
2830320	2832320	I think the thing was always that he was in charge.
2832320	2834320	I think I've even heard like when he was a little kid,
2834320	2837320	his mom was like super alpha, like really in charge.
2837320	2839320	And the kids would come over and she'd make dinner for all the neighborhood kids.
2839320	2842320	And he was a little guy. He wasn't a tough guy,
2842320	2846320	but he was like the mayor of his block when he was a little shrimpy kid
2846320	2849320	because he was just super in charge.
2849320	2852320	Like he had to be the boss of everything, even as a little boy.
2852320	2855320	Scooter, how do we undo talking about Frank Sinatra for 25 minutes?
2855320	2856320	What do we do?
2856320	2859320	Scooter rap. Scooter rap.
2859320	2860320	Are you ready, Dan?
2860320	2862320	I genuinely can't rap anymore.
2862320	2865320	This is your rap. Well, you put in a rap about you.
2870320	2875320	Now his name is S-C-U-D-A, Scooter.
2876320	2883320	Now his name is S-K-O-O-D-A.
2886320	2895320	His name is S-K-U-D-A, H-T-A,
2895320	2901320	S-K-U-D-A, S-K-U-T-A.
2901320	2904320	Hey, hey, hey, yip guy. Come up and say he wanted to be the hype man
2904320	2906320	and do some yips on this.
2906320	2909320	Oh, shit!
2909320	2910320	Grab a mic.
2910320	2914320	And when you feel the time in the rap to do it, you lay it in there.
2914320	2915320	Okay.
2915320	2916320	Yo.
2916320	2917320	Uh-oh.
2917320	2918320	Yo.
2918320	2919320	Okay.
2919320	2922320	Yo, we're gonna get some scooter.
2922320	2926320	I said we're gonna get some scooter.
2927320	2931320	I got my boy's got a 72 barracuda.
2931320	2935320	I got my boy, his name is Scooter.
2935320	2937320	He's wearing all these checks.
2937320	2939320	He's writing all these checks.
2939320	2941320	He's eating all these checks.
2941320	2943320	He's writing all these checks.
2943320	2945320	My boy, he's got these checks.
2945320	2947320	He's got these checks.
2947320	2952320	He's a man to be S-E-O-U-T-A-R-A.
2952320	2953320	Family.
2953320	2955320	Yo, family.
2956320	2958320	Yo.
2958320	2959320	Scooter rap.
2959320	2960320	Scooter rap.
2960320	2962320	Yo, Scooter rap, bad family.
2962320	2966320	I got this shit on my motherfucking Ram-a-me.
2966320	2967320	All right.
2967320	2968320	Yip guy.
2968320	2969320	Yip guy.
2969320	2970320	Oh, that's the yup guy?
2970320	2971320	This is yup guy.
2971320	2972320	All right, yup guy.
2972320	2973320	Well, let's have a seat.
2973320	2975320	Let's have some denouement here.
2975320	2977320	Let's have some denouement.
2977320	2978320	Can we go?
2978320	2980320	Do we have the technology to replay the tape
2980320	2983320	and find out what you rhymed family with, Ram-a-me?
2983320	2984320	I don't know.
2984320	2985320	Ram-a-me?
2985320	2986320	I like the refreshing.
2986320	2989320	My thing is that, listen, my family,
2989320	2993320	they've been ramming me with all this negativity, man.
2993320	2994320	Whoa.
2994320	2996320	And I just drove cross-country
2996320	2998320	because I heard some good spirits
2998320	3002320	and some beautiful people, some of which are here tonight.
3002320	3006320	And I love some of what the Hamburglar was saying before.
3006320	3007320	Ladies and gentlemen.
3007320	3008320	Life being beautiful.
3008320	3010320	I'd like to take this moment for $5.
3010320	3012320	You can subscribe to our podcast
3012320	3014320	and find out what this guy actually looks like.
3019320	3021320	It's not, it's not exactly.
3021320	3022320	Oh, no, no, no.
3022320	3023320	Oh, Jesus.
3023320	3024320	Wow.
3024320	3025320	Casualties.
3025320	3027320	He almost broke his own glasses.
3027320	3029320	It's like a one-man Twilight Zone episode.
3029320	3032320	Time enough at last.
3032320	3034320	Finally get to headbang all I want.
3034320	3035320	Oh, wait.
3035320	3036320	My book on headbanging.
3036320	3040320	I can't read it.
3040320	3042320	Yo, homie, you ever see that episode of Twilight Zone
3042320	3045320	when that guy is sitting in the airplane
3045320	3047320	and he's like, he's chilling in the airplane
3047320	3048320	and he's like having a good time and shit.
3048320	3051320	And then at the end of the episode, he looks out the window.
3051320	3053320	That was me, boy.
3053320	3055320	Wait, what?
3055320	3056320	That's an episode of Twilight Zone?
3056320	3058320	The guy takes an entire plane ride
3058320	3059320	and then looks out the window and someone says,
3059320	3060320	now it's me, boy.
3060320	3062320	Yeah, Jeff saw it.
3062320	3064320	Jeff saw it.
3064320	3065320	Jeff saw it.
3065320	3066320	Jeff, you saw me, boy.
3066320	3068320	What's your name for a style?
3068320	3069320	My name's Dave, man.
3069320	3073320	My name's Dave.
3073320	3074320	My name's for real.
3074320	3075320	My name's Dave.
3075320	3076320	That's right.
3076320	3077320	My name is Dave.
3077320	3078320	That doesn't surprise me a bit.
3078320	3079320	My name's Dave Kline.
3079320	3080320	My name's Dave Kline, baby.
3080320	3081320	Dave, where are you from, man?
3081320	3085320	I'm from New Jersey, baby.
3085320	3087320	And you've been Frank Sinatra for real.
3087320	3088320	For real, though.
3088320	3089320	He's from Hoboken?
3089320	3090320	Where are you from?
3090320	3091320	I'm from Paramus, New Jersey, baby.
3091320	3095320	I was born in Manhattan because my mama was an opera singer.
3095320	3097320	Oh, and then she put you in a basket
3097320	3099320	and sent you the wrong way down the river.
3099320	3104320	Well, what an anti-Mosa story.
3104320	3105320	Honey, you'll love this.
3105320	3106320	You'll love this, honey.
3106320	3108320	My mama was the leading coloratura
3108320	3109320	at New York City Opera.
3109320	3110320	She was the leading what?
3110320	3111320	Coloratura soprano.
3111320	3112320	Oh, I know.
3112320	3113320	Which is like real hot.
3113320	3116320	So if you sing up, so like, I'm a bad boy.
3116320	3118320	So like, my voice, my ladies.
3118320	3122320	My voice goes down, girl.
3122320	3125320	That's my popper, who's also an opera singer.
3125320	3129320	My mama was the leading coloratura soprano in New York City Opera.
3129320	3130320	And she got pregnant.
3130320	3133320	And what happened was they brought in an understudy.
3133320	3136320	And they were like, yo, you getting old?
3136320	3138320	We don't like the way you look no more.
3138320	3140320	You getting pregnant?
3140320	3142320	We're going to bring this gal, all right?
3142320	3144320	And we're going to see what she's at.
3144320	3146320	We're going to see what she do.
3146320	3152320	My mama's pregnant with me, looking her destiny in her face.
3152320	3154320	And she keeps singing.
3154320	3156320	My mama kept singing, all right?
3156320	3157320	My mama kept singing.
3157320	3158320	My mama kept singing.
3158320	3159320	Oh, she's pregnant.
3159320	3161320	Well, she's pregnant with me.
3161320	3162320	Daddy's saying bays.
3162320	3164320	My mama kept singing.
3164320	3168320	But wait, she kept singing in the theater was firing her.
3168320	3170320	Did she keep singing in New Jersey?
3170320	3172320	No, no, my mom.
3172320	3177320	That story sounded like my mom said, fuck childbirth.
3177320	3179320	I'm having a caesarean.
3179320	3181320	She has a caesarean.
3181320	3183320	Has me pulled out of her.
3183320	3184320	Which trimester?
3184320	3186320	On stage?
3186320	3191320	This is actually a David Lynch film directed by Matthew Florida in the mid 80s.
3191320	3193320	This is like heavy duty, heavy hitter shit.
3193320	3196320	This is an origin story.
3196320	3198320	This is the most ancient Greek way to describe it.
3198320	3201320	My mom got laid off and had a caesarean.
3201320	3206320	My mom had my body untimely ripped from her womb.
3206320	3209320	That's what would happen to normal humans.
3209320	3211320	But mama Klein ain't a normal human.
3211320	3213320	She had me cut out of her.
3213320	3214320	Your name is Dave Klein.
3214320	3215320	That's right, baby.
3223320	3224320	My name is Dave Klein.
3224320	3226320	You don't have to press rewind on that either.
3229320	3232320	Mama Klein has me ripped out of whatever parts I was growing in,
3232320	3234320	because they weren't the normal parts.
3234320	3236320	That's the damn shit.
3236320	3238320	And they pull me out of there,
3238320	3241320	and I come scurrying out and sniffing around.
3241320	3243320	And I sniff and I say,
3243320	3244320	I'm here, baby!
3246320	3250320	Well, I'm more of a macho main Randy Savage guy.
3250320	3251320	I don't know.
3251320	3252320	So they pull me out.
3252320	3255320	Long story short, mama Klein's a fucking baller and a writer.
3255320	3256320	She was ready to go.
3256320	3259320	They sewed her up, and she was on stage,
3259320	3263320	singing manol as manol
3263320	3266320	three weeks after having her guts split open
3266320	3269320	and having me fall out of her and spill all over the place.
3269320	3272320	You could take away from that that your mom's a workaholic
3272320	3274320	that didn't care about your well-being.
3278320	3279320	No, Jan.
3279320	3282320	She was a writer, and she was a baller.
3282320	3284320	I mean, this gets into it.
3284320	3287320	The thing is like being the son of an extraordinary woman
3287320	3288320	is a difficult thing.
3288320	3289320	Oh, okay. I like that.
3289320	3290320	That's good.
3290320	3291320	And that's true.
3291320	3292320	You know what?
3292320	3293320	And it was hard for her, and they gave her a check,
3293320	3294320	but she still had you.
3295320	3302320	Yeah, so your burden as a white male with a remarkable mother.
3302320	3305320	Yeah, I have a lot of guilt, and so I have a lot of guilt.
3305320	3306320	She paid a little forward.
3306320	3307320	She's like, fuck that guy.
3307320	3308320	He'll have privilege.
3308320	3311320	I'll semi-abort him and then go back to work.
3314320	3317320	Let him go up to the plates with a couple of strikes.
3317320	3321320	She knew that she had a fury line in her,
3321320	3323320	and that she could kind of throw the kid to the wolf.
3323320	3326320	Some kids, when they get thrown to the wolves, they get eaten.
3326320	3327320	Right.
3327320	3328320	I got thrown to the wolves.
3328320	3330320	Others become Oedipus.
3333320	3334320	Yo, Harmon?
3334320	3335320	Harmon?
3335320	3337320	It was also very fucked up as a momma.
3337320	3339320	Harmon, what'd you just say about my momma?
3339320	3341320	What'd you just Greek Oedipus say about my momma?
3341320	3344320	I said you may be destined to have sex with her.
3344320	3346320	I implied, I implied.
3346320	3350320	Yo, all I'm going to say is that good hair runs in the bloodline.
3351320	3355320	Is your mom still with us?
3355320	3356320	She is.
3356320	3357320	Her name is Claudette Peterson.
3357320	3358320	She's a beautiful woman.
3358320	3360320	Where does she live?
3360320	3362320	How beautiful is she, Dave?
3366320	3368320	Oh, boy.
3368320	3371320	How beautiful is my momma?
3371320	3374320	My momma is so beautiful.
3374320	3377320	How beautiful is she?
3377320	3382320	My momma is so beautiful that Aristotle had to go into the future.
3382320	3384320	Find my momma.
3384320	3385320	Find the time machine.
3385320	3391320	Go back in time so that he could write the right answer for what's beauty.
3391320	3394320	Because when Aristotle wrote it right in the future past, he said,
3394320	3396320	duty is mama Klein.

3404320	3408320	Find out what Dave Klein fucking looks like.
3409320	3412320	He's like Spencer on ketamine.
3418320	3420320	I was going to say it's super cool.
3420320	3423320	I guess you take a marijuana joint and you lace it with PCP.
3423320	3425320	You ever have one of those, Dave?
3425320	3427320	You ever puff a super cool?
3427320	3429320	I actually love to smoke weed.
3429320	3431320	That's a huge reason why I claimed out here.
3431320	3432320	It's 9-11, by the way.
3433320	3435320	I don't know if Dave Klein has any take on that.
3435320	3437320	Well, not to get too real on that,
3437320	3441320	but I went to an all-boys Catholic super sport factory for high school.
3441320	3446320	We lost a couple of boys in the towers,
3446320	3449320	and I was in a classroom watching it.
3449320	3452320	But you confused me with, you went to a factory for...
3452320	3454320	For collegiate athletics.
3454320	3456320	For super sports.
3456320	3458320	Is that like a puppy mill?
3458320	3460320	Like you went to a factory instead of a school?
3460320	3461320	We're going to make you an athlete.
3461320	3464320	What they do is like there's certain places in America where they say like,
3464320	3466320	yo, society's real fucked up and they don't know anything.
3466320	3469320	So like we don't really know a lot of things,
3469320	3471320	but what we do know are like a couple of them.
3471320	3473320	And like what we know...
3475320	3479320	And like what we know, what we know we're going to fucking like do.
3479320	3481320	And we're going to do this shit like hard.
3481320	3483320	We're going to go hard on what we know.
3483320	3485320	Now listen, boy, we don't know nothing.
3485320	3490320	You got to never forget that you know nothing.
3491320	3493320	Think about that. Nothing. You really don't...
3493320	3496320	Anyway, Harmon knows this. Harmon knows you don't know anything
3496320	3500320	until you channel the fury into one or two pursuits.
3500320	3503320	You start jumping down on them all the way, sniffing around.
3503320	3506320	The exits are two in the back.
3506320	3508320	One behind me.
3508320	3510320	So your school had a lacrosse team? What is the...
3510320	3512320	No, no. My school like...
3512320	3514320	Please file out in orderly fashion.
3514320	3515320	So here's a real story.
3515320	3517320	Like for instance, our football team
3517320	3520320	produced the defensive rookie of the year in the NFL.
3520320	3522320	No shit. His name's Brian Cushing.
3522320	3523320	But you used the word factory. I just wanted to know,
3523320	3525320	is that like an actual like cultural thing?
3525320	3529320	Yeah. A sports factory or what are called magnet schools
3529320	3531320	for like virtuosic athletes. So not for nothing.
3531320	3533320	I was a virtuosic swimmer.
3533320	3536320	And I fly through the water and struggle on earth.
3536320	3540320	You do seem like a super soldier program gone awry.
3541320	3543320	I think it does seem like genetically you were going to
3543320	3546320	dealt all the cards and then you just made...
3546320	3549320	Well, I'm not to say... 90 degree choices.
3550320	3551320	You came out of the vat and you were like,
3551320	3553320	where's the record store?
3553320	3557320	Gentlemen, we finally received funding for Operation Metal Beast.
3560320	3566320	It looks like if we took you into like an army barracks
3566320	3568320	and you heard like buzz clippers coming for a while,
3568320	3572320	like a really marketable guy might emerge.
3573320	3576320	Here's the thing, Dan. I went to a school
3576320	3579320	where I got to see a lot of things of like where the future was going to go
3579320	3581320	if I went a one direction.
3581320	3586320	And I did a bad and crazy thing and got crazy addicted to drugs and alcohol.
3586320	3587320	Which ones?
3587320	3588320	Marijuana and alcohol.
3588320	3589320	Marijuana.
3589320	3591320	Flood out most of the alcohol.
3591320	3594320	But it was really, well, for whatever, this is all personal choices.
3594320	3597320	It was more that I was just a real dark human being
3597320	3599320	and wasn't like powerful or skilled,
3599320	3601320	which when you're not powerful or skilled
3601320	3602320	and you want to be powerful.
3602320	3604320	So you felt like there's like a shadow from your mom.
3604320	3606320	Like you see these photos of your mom being super talented
3606320	3608320	and this mythology of your mom being so talented
3608320	3611320	that you had to be ripped from her womb
3611320	3612320	so that she could get back to work.
3612320	3615320	Well, I guess my take on it is that I don't think it's a mythology.
3615320	3616320	I think everybody should be extraordinary.
3616320	3618320	Well, when I say mythology, I don't mean lies.
3618320	3619320	Right.
3619320	3622320	I was afforded some truths that like you can be great
3622320	3624320	if you can like be patient
3624320	3627320	and only care about like a couple fucking things.
3627320	3629320	Keep your family fucking close.
3630320	3632320	So it's family values.
3632320	3633320	Family values.
3633320	3634320	Family values.
3634320	3635320	That's what the yips were for.
3635320	3636320	Family values.
3636320	3637320	Family values.
3637320	3638320	We finally got it.
3638320	3639320	All right, Dave Kline.
3639320	3641320	Are you living in L.A. now?
3641320	3643320	Are you going to be coming back with your yips and your...
3643320	3644320	This is the crazy thing.
3644320	3646320	I came out here for my friend's wedding
3646320	3648320	and that turned into, well, I might as well...
3648320	3650320	And that turned into a null...
3650320	3651320	A what?
3651320	3652320	An annulment.
3652320	3653320	Sorry.
3653320	3655320	Well, no.
3655320	3656320	No.
3657320	3659320	It's just because of your toast is what I was thinking.
3662320	3664320	Just imagine your toast.
3666320	3667320	No comment.
3667320	3668320	No comment.
3668320	3669320	Look, I've known Stuart a long time.
3669320	3670320	Wow.
3670320	3672320	Here's the thing.
3672320	3675320	When you know someone and you really know someone
3675320	3677320	and you don't know anyone else but that person
3677320	3680320	and you're focusing your knowledge on them
3680320	3682320	and you have a connection.
3682320	3684320	And then the father of the bride's like,
3684320	3686320	What's the toast?
3687320	3689320	What are you toasting to?
3689320	3691320	I understand it's passionate.
3691320	3693320	What is it?
3693320	3695320	Well, the funny thing is that this actually happened.
3695320	3698320	It's pretty much exactly how it went down.
3698320	3700320	Oh, I'm sorry.
3701320	3705320	But your friend's still married, right?
3706320	3709320	The gal is the most forgiving and beautiful
3709320	3712320	and wonderful and understanding person.
3712320	3714320	Fucking hamburglers.
3715320	3718320	Adam Goldberg's obviously jealous for obvious reasons.
3720320	3722320	Have you ever seen the video game Space Ace?
3722320	3725320	Adam Goldberg turns into you when you hit that button.
3729320	3730320	Daphne!
3733320	3734320	It's an old reference.
3734320	3736320	You can actually download Space Ace on the Apple Store.
3736320	3737320	It's like five bucks.
3737320	3738320	You can play this whole game.
3738320	3740320	Don Bluth made these laser ducked video games
3740320	3742320	back then, Dragon's Lair and Space Ace.
3742320	3743320	It was incredible.
3743320	3744320	We thought that's what interactivity was going to be.
3744320	3745320	Like a video game would be like,
3745320	3747320	you just watch a cartoon,
3747320	3748320	but all it was is you're watching a cartoon
3748320	3749320	and then an arrow would pop up
3749320	3752320	and you had to hit the joystick the right way.
3752320	3756320	Anyways, so are your friends here by any chance?
3756320	3758320	Did you come here with the wedding?
3759320	3761320	Are they still here?
3761320	3762320	Is the groom here?
3762320	3763320	I feel like we should bring the groom up,
3763320	3765320	but we also need to bring our friends out.
3765320	3767320	We got to get the show in the room.
3767320	3768320	I just want to say,
3769320	3772320	there's a constellation of reasons I came out here.
3773320	3776320	One of for real, and it's so lame,
3776320	3779320	but I'm going to give a voice to a lot of fucking people here.
3779320	3782320	What you do here is so cool and powerful and chill
3782320	3785320	and just opens up a lot of cool avenues.
3785320	3787320	I think he knows what he's talking about.
3787320	3789320	It's just...
3789320	3791320	I like you and Superman tonight.
3792320	3794320	Thanks for having us.
3794320	3796320	I listened to the podcast
3796320	3800320	and it let me know that LA has some shit that I want to do
3800320	3802320	that isn't the crazy,
3802320	3805320	like, are you Jeff Spielberg?
3805320	3808320	Are you Bob Tarantino?
3809320	3813320	You can come out here and form a community of your own.
3813320	3816320	This is one of the biggest resources of LA.
3816320	3819320	Now that we can all make movies and put them on YouTube,
3819320	3822320	it's actually not the place you need to come because they're soundstages.
3822320	3825320	The reason to come now is because of the bumper crop of creative people
3825320	3827320	who are all sitting around spinning their wheels.
3827320	3829320	You can form your own communities.
3829320	3831320	You can do new things. You can form a new industry.
3831320	3834320	Dave Cline is now genuflecting.
3835320	3837320	Listen, listen.
3837320	3839320	We're here because he's right, and I love you guys,
3839320	3841320	and I'm going to bounce much love.
3841320	3843320	Oh, nice! And he self-exits.
3843320	3845320	I like this guy.
3845320	3847320	Dave Cline, the yup guy.
3851320	3853320	All right, all right.
3853320	3855320	No, Scooter. No, Scooter.
3855320	3857320	Scooter, don't take that the wrong way.
3857320	3859320	When I say Dave, you say yup.
3859320	3861320	Dave, yup, Dave, yup.
3861320	3863320	When I say Scooter, you spell it.
3863320	3865320	Scooter, S-C-U-T-A.
3867320	3869320	S-K-U-T-A.
3869320	3871320	S-K-U-T-A.
3871320	3874320	It rhymes, so you remember it the next day.
3875320	3877320	I tried to get out, like, mid Sinatra.
3877320	3879320	No, Scooter.
3879320	3881320	Scooter, we needed you here as ballast.
3882320	3885320	As a physical buffer, like, you took a couple hits there.
3887320	3888320	Scooter.
3888320	3889320	I don't want anything to deal with that.
3889320	3891320	I did get, like, several, like, hair whips to the face.
3891320	3893320	Yeah. And it's fine. It's totally fine.
3893320	3895320	Scooter, it's a different case with you.
3895320	3899320	I mean, that guy, he was a character.
3899320	3901320	We like it when the characters self-exit
3901320	3904320	because otherwise the alternative is, like, cattle prods and stuff like that.
3904320	3907320	You have a very kindhearted nature.
3907320	3909320	We knew we could have asked you to leave at any time.
3909320	3911320	I'm sorry. I praised him for self-exiting.
3911320	3913320	Did not mean that you have been lingering like a...
3913320	3915320	I hadn't said anything for a while.
3915320	3917320	Scooter, you're not leaving. You're staying the whole show up here, babe.
3917320	3918320	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3918320	3920320	Scooter ain't leaving.
3920320	3923320	He's like a... He's our fuzzy dice.
3923320	3925320	Scooter's fuzzy dice.
3925320	3927320	You're what makes... You bring the whole Chevy together.
3927320	3930320	I got my Scooter in the rear view.
3930320	3932320	Poppin' on the AIDS tonight.
3932320	3934320	It's a surf AIDS song.
3934320	3936320	This is a surf AIDS song. I don't know.
3937320	3939320	Poppin' on the AIDS?
3939320	3941320	Yeah, I don't know.
3942320	3946320	I gotta run, run, run and be aware of AIDS today.
3947320	3951320	Say, if the surfer culture came back but was more modern and...
3951320	3954320	I got my red ribbon on my vest.
3960320	3964320	I feel like we're living in a strange vacuum after Dave Klein got off the stage.
3965320	3967320	He brought a lot of empowerment.
3967320	3969320	It's like coming down off ecstasy.
3969320	3972320	The serotonin has just all left our bodies.
3972320	3977320	If you imagine that guy, but if he didn't like me, that's my brother.
3983320	3986320	That's what makes me kind of enamored with him.
3986320	3988320	All the zeal, none of the affection.
3988320	3991320	I love this... My brother was so passionate.
3991320	3993320	That was a pleasure, Dave. Thank you, man.
3994320	3997320	I like that his life is mythical, that he has a goddess for a mom.
3997320	4000320	Really, there's more there.
4000320	4005320	We live in a world where we all have our filters, we all have our things that we keep hidden.
4005320	4010320	Dave, you come up here and you dance and you headbang and stuff like that.
4010320	4015320	You also reveal a lot about yourself, but even then I'm sure there's stuff that you have to hide about yourself.
4015320	4016320	I hide behind a suit.
4016320	4020320	He also revealed a lot about the skill of the carpenters that assembled this platform.
4020320	4023320	I don't think that that was ever expected of them.
4023320	4026320	You think in LA if you're not making a movie, you're probably phoning it in,
4026320	4030320	but whoever made this platform wasn't fucking around.
4030320	4033320	He revealed a lot about the limits of Scooter's physical endurance.
4037320	4042320	I just like it when it's straight, no chaser. It was very good.
4042320	4047320	It's been a wonderful organic show, but only at the expense of we've deprived our friends.
4047320	4049320	That's not the pride of our audience friends anymore.
4049320	4051320	Let's bring out Des Moines Brown and Spencer Crittenden, shall we?
4058320	4060320	It's our fact to follow, boys.
4060320	4079320	Hey, Spencer, what was it like to see the version of you that would have existed had you been Superman,
4079320	4082320	and Superman 4 Quest for Peace had been...
4085320	4087320	Eric clapped. Eric liked it.
4088320	4090320	You know, the internet's a great place.
4090320	4094320	I was trolling the Reddit thread about this episode,
4094320	4097320	and someone pulled up a picture of him with his family from the past.
4099320	4102320	It's creepy, man. It's a creepy world.
4102320	4105320	Oh, not the photo. You're saying the ability to see that is creepy.
4105320	4108320	Yeah, I mean, who knew, right?
4108320	4113320	It's just you come up five seconds later, your whole Zaba search is up there on Reddit.
4114320	4117320	Zaba search is a great website for pervs and stalkers.
4119320	4123320	Your one-stop cyberbullying shop, Zaba search.
4124320	4128320	What was the thing they used to humiliate the Star Wars kid?
4130320	4132320	There was like a certain program that was referenced.
4132320	4134320	Remember the Star Wars kid?
4134320	4135320	It was so long ago.
4135320	4137320	It was like a video that was shared way before YouTube.
4137320	4139320	I know it was on Napster.
4139320	4142320	Yeah, it was like a file sharing service.
4143320	4144320	It was a Z.
4145320	4147320	Oh, I remember.
4147320	4148320	Yeah.
4148320	4150320	I wonder what happened with that kid.
4150320	4154320	It's just like, what a weird phenomenon that was.
4154320	4156320	It's still such weird things.
4156320	4160320	We're 20 years into, everybody's listening, everybody's watching,
4160320	4162320	and we're still...
4162320	4164320	I don't know if this will ever stop.
4164320	4166320	We're still so fascinated with the minutia,
4166320	4171320	because these things pop up that's out of context and brought to the fore.
4171320	4175320	Now I'm thinking of the Africa AIDS joke lady,
4175320	4177320	and how that phenomenon happened,
4177320	4181320	how she was tweeting and she made this dumb, bad joke
4181320	4184320	because she's not a comedian.
4185320	4189320	And by the time she landed in Africa,
4189320	4192320	she was literally world famous and definitely fired
4192320	4193320	and definitely like...
4193320	4196320	And it's absolutely no judgment on...
4196320	4198320	I think that's the thing.
4199320	4201320	Why judgment, why...
4201320	4204320	Outside of that, the phenomenon happening becomes the bigger story.
4204320	4207320	We have the power now to destroy human life,
4207320	4211320	outside of referendum, outside of criminal courts, outside.
4211320	4212320	We can really...
4212320	4215320	We've always had that power, but it was like broadcast news
4215320	4219320	would occasionally graze across an individual human life.
4219320	4221320	It was like, oh, you were on the nightly news,
4221320	4222320	and it was a rarer thing,
4222320	4225320	but now you can just go from the airport fucking around
4225320	4229320	to the cover of Time Magazine in a bad way
4229320	4233320	in the span of a three hour span.
4236320	4240320	It's equal parts scary and kind of invigorating
4240320	4244320	because also this is the same thing that we're finding out.
4244320	4247320	It's not like cops are all of a sudden going insane.
4247320	4250320	It's like, clearly it's been a high pressure job for a while
4250320	4252320	and some shit's been swept into the carpet
4253320	4257320	and individual instances are becoming like evil.
4257320	4259320	Everybody wasn't wearing a camera at all times.
4259320	4261320	Yeah, now we're just like,
4261320	4264320	we're awakening to this world of taste buds.
4264320	4267320	Everything tastes all fucked up.
4267320	4270320	We're focusing on these individual things.
4270320	4274320	I think, I guess my hope is that we can kind of aggregate that
4274320	4278320	into some common sense stuff about, for instance...
4278320	4280320	Well, it's going to force people to be serious
4280320	4282320	about what they say and what they do.
4282320	4286320	I mean, you see politicians now who are, I assume, older.
4286320	4288320	Maybe this is why, but they're behind the curve
4288320	4292320	and you have them telling stories or their renditions of things
4292320	4295320	because they're used to being caught up to
4295320	4298320	if they're going to get vetted maybe a year or two years later
4298320	4300320	and now it's happening pretty much instantly.
4300320	4303320	It happened to Hillary when she was talking about that plane landing.
4303320	4305320	Yeah, well also this new phenomenon,
4305320	4308320	this next generation politicians,
4308320	4310320	okay, so the guy that took over The Daily Show,
4310320	4313320	he made like, when he was 20-something,
4313320	4317320	like, oh my God, the jokes that I made when I was in my 20s
4317320	4319320	and the guy is taking over The Daily Show,
4319320	4320320	so we saw that phenomenon.
4320320	4325320	He was vetted because Jon Stewart is, for better or for worse, a senator.
4325320	4329320	He's retiring and the guy taking his place needed to be vetted
4329320	4331320	and he was vetted via the internet
4331320	4334320	and there's a public record of him growing as a comedian,
4334320	4337320	including all of his Jew jokes and his misogyny
4337320	4340320	and stuff like him experimenting with trying to be funny.
4340320	4344320	And so politicians, holy shit man,
4344320	4348320	the next generation of people trying to be senators and presidents,
4348320	4350320	you're going to be able to go back and go like,
4350320	4353320	yeah, I want to think of it as a good thing
4353320	4355320	but my concern is that it's just going to enter a new
4355320	4359320	Elizabethan kind of, or Victorian, I don't know anything about history,
4359320	4365320	that prudence will reign and that will not free us.
4365320	4369320	I think what's happening right now is that, I hate politics
4369320	4372320	and I don't like Republicans or Democrats particularly
4372320	4375320	and people have this choice to make with Hillary,
4375320	4378320	she'll be the only nominee, right?
4378320	4381320	And there are people that are like, she's not a perfect candidate
4381320	4384320	but I think nowadays, I don't think there will ever be such a thing
4384320	4387320	as a perfect candidate again because there will be no secrets, no mysteries.
4387320	4390320	All of your warts and pimples and flaws are going to be
4390320	4393320	so much a matter of public record for your entire existence
4393320	4396320	that maybe there's a possible...
4396320	4399320	Or there will be super humans like Barack Obama who,
4399320	4403320	the thing that was significant about him to me
4403320	4407320	was his ability to withstand all of that shit.
4407320	4409320	That became a kind of hero's journey in and of itself.
4409320	4412320	I started rooting for him because as much as I hate politicians,
4412320	4415320	I'm like, fuck yeah, fuck you for trying to dirty this guy
4415320	4417320	and you can't find it, you can't figure it out,
4417320	4419320	you can't figure out why he's a bad guy.
4419320	4423320	But my concern is that then it's just like we evolve in that direction,
4423320	4425320	that these people continue to like...
4425320	4430320	You pull them out of their mother's womb either untimely or not.
4430320	4433320	And you put it on a scale and you barcode.
4433320	4437320	This is already my perception of the political career path.
4437320	4440320	They are pulled out of a womb in a different hospital.
4440320	4441320	Have you noticed that we're getting less...
4441320	4444320	Oops, now that Dave got all that out of his system.
4444320	4446320	Yeah, he's good.
4446320	4450320	He's now in his mind, he's curled up in his mother's brass going,
4450320	4452320	you...
4456320	4458320	Or she's going like, you...
4458320	4459320	Brushing his hair.
4459320	4461320	It's way higher, way higher, she's a soprano.
4461320	4462320	Yup!
4462320	4465320	And the glasses are breaking.
4465320	4468320	That's why he brings two pairs of glasses on stage.
4468320	4470320	What is my point?
4470320	4472320	When I was a communications major in college,
4472320	4474320	my professor Ken Sobiak said,
4474320	4476320	technology comes, we keep trying to figure out,
4476320	4478320	is this good technology or bad technology?
4478320	4482320	MP3, direct broadcast satellite, internet, YouTube.
4482320	4484320	It always turns out it's more good and more bad.
4484320	4486320	I keep...
4488320	4490320	The internet...
4490320	4492320	We put Scooter to work apparently trying to kill me.
4492320	4495320	Scooter's not become bartender, I love that.
4495320	4497320	The internet represents like new...
4497320	4498320	Scooters, you like one?
4498320	4500320	No, I'm good, thank you.
4500320	4503320	New opportunities for the truth to come out
4503320	4506320	and I just worry that it represents a new agenda
4506320	4509320	for lives to get more games of thronies.
4509320	4512320	I think what it's going to inevitably do,
4512320	4514320	and it does, like, to people that,
4514320	4517320	when you first get on Twitter and you have five followers,
4517320	4520320	you make poopy jokes and any joke, you don't give a shit.
4520320	4524320	Then like you, all of a sudden you crossed a critical mass threshold
4524320	4528320	of amount of followers, you already have to start sanding the edges down
4528320	4531320	and then trimming major corners off.
4531320	4532320	Yeah.
4532320	4535320	You have to decide what stick you are,
4535320	4538320	because it's not like I'm just some bland vanilla person,
4538320	4541320	but I did have to pick which fucking specific stick I was.
4541320	4542320	You know what?
4542320	4543320	I was right...
4543320	4546320	I did the wrong thing and I made the right decision afterwards.
4546320	4550320	I posted a video for like ten seconds from...
4550320	4552320	I went against everything I believe in,
4552320	4554320	I went to this music festival called Stagecoach
4554320	4555320	because my friend was singing,
4555320	4558320	and it's Coachella but country music, it's on the same fairgrounds.
4558320	4561320	I despise music festivals because it's a bunch of douchebags
4561320	4562320	and there's dirt everywhere.
4562320	4566320	And you have to eat some horrible pizza.
4566320	4569320	It was great because I saw Merle Haggard, which I loved,
4569320	4570320	and it was very fun.
4570320	4574320	Every girl there unanimously in short shirts,
4574320	4576320	which seems like something that I'd be all for,
4576320	4579320	but they were all this young and just...
4579320	4585320	What bothered me, it was 100% white people.
4585320	4586320	You can't have a festival.
4586320	4587320	Gross.
4587320	4588320	I know.
4589320	4591320	Makes you rich.
4591320	4594320	I don't like when it's homogenous like that.
4594320	4595320	That's not a festival.
4595320	4597320	Have a couple, like other people.
4597320	4601320	So anyway, I was walking by this...
4601320	4604320	Don't just have an all-white festival.
4604320	4607320	Not by design, it's a country festival, so of course.
4607320	4612320	But I was walking by this trash cans
4612320	4617320	and they have Recycle Bin, Landfill Bin, Compost Bin.
4617320	4620320	And there was a security guard, kind of supine,
4620320	4622320	laying there lazily on some hay bales next to those,
4622320	4623320	doing nothing.
4623320	4626320	Like a hee-haw sketch.
4626320	4631320	Out of corn stocks, and at some point Ray Price came through.
4631320	4633320	So, Roy Price, what was it?
4633320	4636320	Anyway, there was this two girls, and I took a video,
4636320	4638320	which is quite hilarious, and I'll show you after the show,
4638320	4639320	if you'd like to see it.
4639320	4642320	Two girls wearing the same outfit, white short shirts,
4642320	4644320	and one girl was holding the other girl's hair back
4644320	4645320	as the other girl was vomiting,
4646320	4648320	and I thought quite cleverly, into the Compost Bin.
4648320	4649320	I thought that was nice.
4649320	4651320	That's good, right?
4651320	4653320	That would be like the best compost ever.
4653320	4655320	It's not landfill, it's not landfill.
4655320	4656320	You don't want to recycle vomit.
4656320	4658320	But also it doesn't ruin the compost process, right?
4658320	4660320	I think you're speeding it up.
4660320	4662320	I think you're halfway home.
4662320	4664320	I'm actually asking.
4664320	4666320	I'm almost certain, if you vomited on a cornfield,
4666320	4668320	you'd grow some nice ass corn.
4668320	4671320	Aren't there worms in there doing work?
4671320	4673320	I don't know, if the vomit kills the worms,
4673320	4674320	maybe that's actually bad.
4674320	4676320	I think at this stage in the game, there's nothing happening yet.
4676320	4678320	Later on, you want the worms to start doing it.
4678320	4679320	Okay, I'm confused.
4679320	4680320	I don't know.
4680320	4681320	This is a trash can.
4681320	4683320	I'd never seen a Compost Bin at a major event,
4683320	4684320	but I liked it.
4684320	4685320	That's very cool.
4685320	4686320	And also I thought, how good for this guy,
4686320	4687320	for holding the hair back.
4687320	4688320	So I guess I'm like, got it.
4688320	4690320	I'm walking by and my thumb is in my hand like, boop, video.
4690320	4692320	And I go by, and what I wanted to do,
4692320	4694320	because the girl's legs was kind of spread,
4694320	4696320	and I wanted to end the shot by going down
4696320	4698320	and seeing the word compost,
4698320	4700320	because that would be hilarious.
4700320	4701320	And then I would kind of zoom in
4701320	4703320	and I would win a Pulitzer Prize.
4704320	4706320	When I get down to the final shots,
4706320	4708320	it turns out her legs were too close together,
4708320	4711320	and I'm just now filming her ass.
4711320	4713320	And you're calling out, spread your legs.
4713320	4714320	Spread them.
4714320	4716320	Show me the compo side.
4716320	4718320	So now I'm just creepy McTavish.
4718320	4720320	I'm 49 years old and I'm 40.
4720320	4721320	Creepy McTavish.
4721320	4723320	I'm double her age, their age.
4723320	4725320	And the hilarious thing is when I watched the video,
4725320	4727320	and it's so good, is that each time she vomits,
4727320	4730320	and she vomits, she hurls twice in this six-second span,
4730320	4733320	she does a little twerky booty shake.
4734320	4735320	And it's really funny.
4735320	4737320	So I put it online on Instagram.
4737320	4740320	I said, a good friend,
4740320	4742320	a good person holds her friend's hair back when she's puking.
4742320	4746320	A great person makes sure it's in the compost bin.
4746320	4750320	It's stagecoach2015, hashtag booty shake.
4750320	4753320	And it was up for fucking five seconds,
4753320	4754320	and I had eight hate mails.
4754320	4756320	Like, you invasive, creepy asshole.
4756320	4758320	Like, take that down.
4758320	4760320	Because the end of your shot, you showed it to me.
4760320	4762320	You were trying for that compost label,
4762320	4764320	but you successfully just framed her ass.
4764320	4766320	Should I show it on camera?
4766320	4767320	Should we show this?
4767320	4768320	Yeah, you should.
4768320	4770320	The audience won't see it, though.
4770320	4771320	I'm not going to.
4771320	4773320	Well, Jamor, you were going to say something.
4773320	4774320	You kept getting derailed.
4774320	4775320	I'll show you after the show.
4775320	4776320	It's hilarious.
4776320	4778320	We were talking about the internet's dual capacity
4778320	4781320	for truth bringing, but also then encouraging lives.
4781320	4784320	I just think that it's going to create other specialties,
4784320	4788320	other jobs, which are the people who vet the people
4788320	4789320	who are telling these stories.
4789320	4791320	So especially in politics, you have people
4791320	4793320	running for office who are going to have these anecdotes.
4793320	4796320	I mean, Romney had an anecdote when she talked about
4796320	4799320	a very clear memory of some sort of convention,
4799320	4801320	being at some sort of convention with his father
4801320	4803320	and his father's holding him in his arms.
4803320	4804320	And the convention he was talking about,
4804320	4806320	he hadn't been born yet.
4806320	4808320	So all it took was an intern at Maddow to go,
4808320	4809320	hey, we got this thing.
4809320	4811320	And then half the episode was that.
4811320	4813320	And then just playing that over and over again
4813320	4814320	and then going, let's look at the timeline
4814320	4816320	and doing graphics and other shit.
4816320	4817320	Well, what is that?
4817320	4818320	So they're going to need people implanted in.
4818320	4820320	And what you had with Obama was you had people
4820320	4823320	who recognized, OK, here's another channel.
4823320	4825320	We can't get everybody directly.
4825320	4826320	But there's this internet thing.
4826320	4829320	And there's this information that's traveling faster.
4829320	4831320	And there's the way people read information.
4831320	4833320	Poll results are coming out because news agencies
4833320	4837320	are not news agencies anymore by the normal sort of accords.
4837320	4838320	Now they just want clicks.
4838320	4839320	That's why he won.
4839320	4840320	So they're reprint.
4840320	4841320	They're reprint.
4841320	4842320	Yeah, they were just faster.
4842320	4843320	They were faster.
4843320	4844320	They were quicker.
4844320	4845320	They were better.
4845320	4846320	It's just like racing grandpa.
4846320	4848320	It was exactly like JFK beat Nixon.
4848320	4851320	It was just sort of like the new technology and understanding
4851320	4855320	and Nixon, I don't know if it's apocryphal or not,
4855320	4857320	but Nixon refused makeup for the first debate.
4857320	4858320	And sweated.
4858320	4859320	And looked nervous.
4859320	4860320	And sweated.
4860320	4861320	And looked horrible.
4861320	4864320	And it's like, no, you're being digitized into a box.
4864320	4866320	He hadn't changed until he was wearing makeup.
4866320	4867320	Like, lay it on me.
4867320	4868320	Like, give me all the stage makeup.
4868320	4869320	Yeah.
4869320	4871320	And so anyways, but yeah.
4871320	4875320	And so with Obama, you've got like, OK.
4875320	4880320	You're good at having even Dan Harmon respect you.
4880320	4885320	Like, you can't even like, he's bulletproof.
4885320	4888320	Like, from all views, you know, there's no stories.
4888320	4890320	There's no, you know.
4890320	4894320	And then it's like, but then it's like, you're president for eight years.
4894320	4896320	And it's like, Guantanamo doesn't close.
4896320	4902320	And the district, the fucking attorney general is like waging war
4902320	4905320	on pot dispensaries while the pot is becoming increasingly legal.
4905320	4907320	It's all the same horseshit political shit.
4907320	4910320	Anything that matters to me, this president is no different
4910320	4912320	from fucking anybody that came before him.
4912320	4914320	He's just another fucking president.
4914320	4917320	My question is, like, are we ever going to get to the point
4917320	4920320	where like, something snaps where we have a choice
4920320	4923320	between having a human being as a civil servant?
4923320	4928320	We go like, well, this guy walks with a limp and hates Malaysians
4928320	4933320	and smoked pot and had a bad divorce.
4933320	4939320	And like, here's all his flaws, but blah, blah, blah, fucking blah.
4939320	4940320	And you know what?
4940320	4946320	Also, not even a big fan of this hot button or that hot button,
4946320	4949320	but civil servant wants to save the country.
4949320	4953320	I would love to go back to Dave where the presidency wasn't a celebrity office.
4953320	4956320	It used to be, it's kind of a kind of a very...
4956320	4957320	But you also have to clerk.
4957320	4960320	You have to go back to the days where the opposition,
4960320	4965320	the group not in power actually respected the presidency.
4965320	4968320	And there was a point where that turned where they said,
4968320	4970320	okay, well, now we're going to violate even that.
4970320	4971320	Right.
4971320	4974320	And there was a point when the League of Women Voters,
4974320	4979320	I think this was in the 70s, who used to always moderate all the debates,
4979320	4985320	retired from the process and issued a statement that should be emblazoned
4985320	4991320	on tablets and thrown down upon us as we dance naked around golden calves.
4991320	4994320	But instead, because it wasn't written by God
4994320	4997320	and was written by the League of Women Voters is forgotten.
4997320	5002320	But they in a paragraph fucking just like summed up.
5002320	5005320	They said, we are not moderating debates anymore.
5005320	5007320	I'm not quoting them at all.
5007320	5008320	Look it up.
5008320	5010320	Look what they said when they retired from the thing.
5010320	5014320	They said that I will paraphrase them for my own purposes and say,
5014320	5019320	they said, we are tired of participating in a bipartisan sham.
5019320	5024320	We are tired of participating in a rehearsed fucking thing.
5024320	5026320	This is all bullshit.
5026320	5028320	We are not doing this anymore.
5028320	5029320	And then...
5029320	5030320	Dave, can I get a yup?
5030320	5031320	There they are.
5031320	5035320	Like the Comedy Central roast was taken over by Comedy Central,
5035320	5037320	I assume because the Friars had a problem with it.
5037320	5040320	For better or for worse, everyone was just like,
5040320	5045320	okay, fine, ladies, no more debates hosted by you anyways.
5045320	5050320	It's just like there is a big, big, big, big...
5050320	5053320	We're drunk on our own success.
5053320	5056320	When you're an empire, who's going to tell you to change?
5056320	5057320	Why would you ever change?
5057320	5059320	The reason you change is because you're losing.
5059320	5061320	You got to look at the team above you and go,
5061320	5062320	we're getting our asses kicked.
5062320	5064320	We got to shake things up.
5064320	5067320	But the people at the top, the empires always just crumble
5067320	5069320	because they don't fucking figure it out.
5069320	5071320	Why can't you just figure it out?
5071320	5073320	Why can't you just look at your own bullshit and go,
5073320	5077320	look at this old mailman landing on the lawn in his flying helicopter.
5077320	5081320	All he's saying is, why is money involved in government?
5081320	5082320	That doesn't make any sense.
5082320	5085320	We're at King's Landing where money runs everything,
5085320	5087320	but why the fuck are our civil servants?
5087320	5090320	Why should money affect your election?
5090320	5091320	That's insane.
5091320	5093320	You're controlling the free world.
5094320	5098320	If you just think about that with common sense for a second,
5098320	5102320	everything says campaign reform, campaign reform, campaign reform,
5102320	5105320	and everyone in charge of everything that would ever change that
5105320	5108320	is already lining their pockets so it will never change.
5108320	5111320	So the fucking guy got in a goddamn flying bicycle
5111320	5112320	and he called the government and said,
5112320	5113320	I'm coming in.
5113320	5115320	And he wrote letters saying, I'm coming in.
5115320	5119320	And he mostly thought he'd be shot down
5119320	5121320	because he thought that might happen.
5121320	5126320	And if that happens, maybe that will be a life well spent as an American.
5126320	5129320	And he landed on the fucking Congress's lawn.
5129320	5133320	And because he got through safely, CNN is just going,
5133320	5136320	so how much more money should we spend on missile defense?
5136320	5138320	First the left, then the right.
5138320	5141320	This is the full view.
5141320	5144320	Well, I believe we should spend $50 million on missiles.
5144320	5146320	I mean, that guy could have been loaded with ISIS people.
5146320	5147320	Well, I disagree.
5147320	5150320	I think only three ISIS people could be on that, copter.
5150320	5152320	So I think we should be $100 million.
5152320	5155320	Well, you've just witnessed the left and the right.
5155320	5156320	Those are your margins.
5156320	5159320	Get back to work, cocksuckers.
5159320	5161320	Sorry if you're a cocksucker.
5161320	5165320	This is having brought to you by Honda Motors.
5165320	5169320	How about the idea that this old fucking hippie civil servant
5169320	5171320	who delivers mail to people,
5171320	5175320	which is a government agency which has never taken any of your taxes,
5176320	5179320	that runs on its own money, which is why they sold stamps.
5179320	5182320	They figured out self-sufficiency in an age when the FCC
5182320	5185320	couldn't give up their fucking power enough to go away
5185320	5187320	when greats would have demanded it.
5187320	5189320	Like, this guy is legacy.
5189320	5191320	He should be a national hero.
5191320	5193320	In Europe, they celebrate the lives of people
5193320	5195320	who tried to blow up the government.
5195320	5197320	They're cool that way.
5197320	5199320	They have maturity on their side.
5199320	5200320	They can handle it.
5200320	5202320	We can't even fucking, like, we fire Bill Maher
5202320	5204320	for calling the terrorists not cowards
5204320	5207320	and then we yell at him for being an Islamophobe ten years later.
5207320	5209320	We don't know what we're doing except that we're scared.
5209320	5211320	We're scared to talk wrong.
5211320	5212320	We're scared to be wrong.
5212320	5216320	This fucking guy is 70 years old and said in his manifesto video
5216320	5219320	when he was absolutely established that he was perfectly sane.
5219320	5221320	He's fucking Joan of Arc saying, like,
5221320	5226320	I just don't want to have spent my life in this great country
5226320	5228320	watching it fall apart.
5228320	5231320	I just want to do something as I enter the twilight of my life
5231320	5233320	that I think might make a difference.
5233320	5236320	So I am a mailman so I'm making this mail vehicle
5236320	5238320	and I'm writing a letter to each senator.
5238320	5240320	We should listen to anybody that in their spare time
5240320	5242320	makes a goddamn helicopter plane thing.
5242320	5243320	That's pretty cool.
5243320	5247320	And we can't handle the fact that we should have been better able to shoot him down.
5247320	5252320	First of all, who gives a fuck if the goddamn House of Congress is defended?
5252320	5253320	Fuck you.
5253320	5255320	It's not an important building.
5255320	5257320	It's a bunch of fucking idiots.
5257320	5258320	I don't fucking care.
5258320	5260320	Defend the fucking coastline.
5260320	5262320	Defend the fucking, like, people.
5262320	5264320	If you want to kill senators, they're never there.
5264320	5266320	That's the worst place to bomb.
5266320	5268320	Yeah, fucking blow up a bathhouse down the street.
5268320	5273320	Like, where the fuck are these people?
5273320	5274320	They grow on trees.
5274320	5276320	They're people that want to be powerful and work for no money.
5276320	5279320	Oh, where will we find another one of those?
5279320	5282320	The government's not going to fucking fail if you blow up that.
5282320	5284320	Okay, all right.
5284320	5286320	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
5286320	5287320	Edit that.
5287320	5289320	Let's play, actually.
5289320	5294320	Why don't we harness our blowing up things into some shadow rub?
5294320	5296320	Scoota, will you play with us?
5296320	5300320	Yeah, absolutely.
5300320	5303320	Scoota, is he going to be Mercy or the Doctor?
5303320	5305320	What would you like to be?
5305320	5307320	Oh, yeah, your choice, Scoota.
5307320	5309320	Doctor is...
5309320	5310320	Curdus.
5310320	5311320	Spelled with a K.
5311320	5312320	No, no, no.
5312320	5313320	Yeah, I'll do the Doctor.
5313320	5315320	I was trying to just run through what they'd done in the past.
5315320	5316320	I'll do the Doctor.
5316320	5320320	All right, so do we be cisnormative and bring up a girl to play Mercy,
5320320	5321320	or do we...
5321320	5323320	We haven't had any women up here, so, right?
5323320	5327320	Adam, no, you had your moment, Adam.
5327320	5330320	It's fucking Dave Klein up here, just fucking do this.
5330320	5331320	Wait, really?
5331320	5333320	No.
5333320	5335320	No, no, Dave Klein had his spotlight.
5335320	5337320	I saw a timid hand here.
5337320	5338320	Jen, I was up before.
5338320	5340320	Oh, you're Jen, you're up before.
5340320	5343320	Well, okay, let's get some new blood.
5343320	5344320	Right here, what's your name?
5344320	5345320	Equally timid hand.
5345320	5346320	Alyssa.
5346320	5347320	Alyssa?
5347320	5348320	Oh, the name would...
5348320	5349320	That's the audition?
5349320	5351320	Do you want to come up?
5351320	5358320	Alyssa, everybody, welcome here to the stage.
5358320	5364320	I guess if you said I am Hitler, it would be a name, it would be like...
5364320	5368320	All right, Dan, do you want to pass down the character sheets, please?
5368320	5371320	Alyssa, what's your backstory?
5371320	5372320	Well, I'm...
5372320	5373320	Hi.
5373320	5374320	I'm...
5374320	5375320	You can figure this out, right?
5375320	5377320	It's a pile of folders.
5377320	5381320	Unfortunately, my background isn't as cool as everyone else's, you know, but...
5381320	5384320	Who's background tonight has been cool?
5384320	5386320	Dave fucking Klein, man.
5386320	5387320	Yeah, Dave...
5387320	5389320	I can't even compare to that.
5389320	5391320	I was born and raised in the valley, so...
5391320	5392320	Well, okay.
5392320	5395320	So, are you a regular here, or is this your first show?
5395320	5398320	Oh, no, I've been here a couple times, actually.
5398320	5400320	You know, I sit in the corner.
5400320	5403320	Do you listen all the time?
5403320	5404320	You mean online?
5404320	5406320	Because I'm kind of cheap.
5406320	5407320	I don't...
5407320	5408320	You're from the valley?
5408320	5409320	What city?
5409320	5410320	North Hills.
5410320	5411320	Yeah, what high school did you go to?
5411320	5412320	James Monroe High School.
5412320	5413320	James Monroe?
5413320	5414320	Monroech, yeah.
5414320	5415320	Monroech?
5415320	5416320	Yeah.
5416320	5417320	Was it... was it... was it Scooby?
5417320	5418320	Yeah, it was pretty nasty.
5418320	5421320	You know Monroe hit women.
5421320	5424320	Was that LA Unified, or is that a different thing as Valley?
5424320	5429320	Yeah, see, anybody from the LA area knows of LAUSD, it's kind of like...
5429320	5430320	Oh, I don't know.
5430320	5431320	I don't know anything about that.
5431320	5433320	Kids come up, they talk about their school, and they go like,
5433320	5434320	I'm from...
5434320	5438320	And I go like, oh, cool.
5438320	5441320	Most people who actually lived in the valley have never heard of Monroe.
5441320	5443320	They know of the other schools around there.
5443320	5447320	But never Monroe, because we're a failure school.
5447320	5449320	So, you're a college student?
5449320	5450320	What's your ambition?
5450320	5451320	What's your interest?
5451320	5452320	I'm like, college student?
5452320	5453320	No, I'm not.
5453320	5455320	Are you in high school?
5455320	5456320	No.
5456320	5458320	I dropped out of college twice.
5458320	5459320	I got confused.
5459320	5460320	Why do...
5460320	5462320	Oh, because he asked you what school you went to.
5462320	5463320	Yeah, that's high school.
5463320	5464320	High school.
5464320	5465320	What do you... what do you...
5465320	5469320	What's your... do you have a, like, a light that you're headed towards?
5469320	5470320	I hope not.
5470320	5471320	Is she dying?
5471320	5473320	That would be terrible, I think.
5473320	5474320	I'm kind of young.
5474320	5477320	An ambition, you know, a fantasy job.
5477320	5481320	Well, I do have a job in working at Universal Studios Hollywood
5481320	5483320	for the past four years as a ride operator.
5483320	5484320	Oh, you had an operator.
5484320	5485320	Which ride?
5485320	5486320	I used to work there.
5486320	5487320	Where are you working?
5487320	5490320	I used to work at Jurassic Park River Adventure, Despicable Me Minion Mayhem,
5490320	5493320	The Mummy Ride, and super silly fun, though.
5493320	5496320	I spent the summer dressed up as Harry from Harry and the Hendersons
5496320	5498320	in a Sasquatch suit.
5499320	5500320	Fucking dope.
5500320	5503320	I want to ask you about the Jurassic Park ride,
5503320	5506320	but I think you'll get fired because it'll come back to you.
5506320	5508320	It's the best place to work at.
5508320	5510320	There's an urban myth about the ride,
5510320	5513320	about the T-Rex malfunctioning and spraying searing hot hydraulic fluid
5513320	5515320	onto the people.
5515320	5518320	That is actually true, and it doesn't, they don't do that anymore.
5518320	5519320	Now it's just pressure that I deserve.
5519320	5520320	Oh, no, they just roar at you.
5520320	5521320	Now they just roar at you.
5521320	5523320	Okay, yeah, now it's just, now it's okay.
5523320	5525320	Now nothing gets sprayed at you.
5525320	5527320	Chris Pratt came in and trained the T-Rex.
5527320	5529320	It's like, stay.
5529320	5532320	Like, touch this nose, and it was just like, be still.
5532320	5534320	Now it doesn't really move anymore.
5534320	5536320	I was working at Universal when that ride first opened,
5536320	5539320	when Jurassic Park ride, well, I think just after it opened,
5539320	5541320	and they wanted to put walk-around characters in there,
5541320	5543320	and so they wanted, like, back to the future,
5543320	5545320	like a Doc Brown, and he would run around and stuff.
5545320	5546320	And I was part of a walk-
5546320	5547320	He's actually still there.
5547320	5549320	Well, maybe the same way.
5549320	5552320	No, he's the actual original guy died like a couple years ago.
5552320	5553320	Oh, so?
5553320	5554320	Yeah.
5554320	5556320	I'm almost certain I shared a break room with him.
5556320	5557320	Yeah.
5557320	5558320	He was a sweetheart, though.
5558320	5561320	But there was, I went and auditioned.
5561320	5565320	They thought about having, who's the doctor, the Attenborough from?
5565320	5566320	Hamond.
5566320	5567320	Dr. Hamond.
5567320	5568320	Hamond?
5568320	5569320	John Hamond.
5569320	5570320	John Hamond.
5570320	5573320	Him and a Malcolm, like a Goldblum character.
5573320	5576320	And I went to the hand prop lot, and I got a leather jacket,
5576320	5580320	and I rehearsed and learned in a Jeff Goldblum impression,
5580320	5582320	and went to the hand prop lot,
5582320	5585320	which is an enormous building down in the back lot.
5585320	5586320	And I walked in, I said,
5586320	5588320	do you have Jeff Goldblum's glasses from Jurassic Park?
5588320	5591320	And they go, yeah, we have the clear ones and the sunglasses.
5591320	5593320	I go, okay, where are they?
5593320	5595320	I just walked in, no one knew who I was.
5595320	5596320	I think he goes, it's right here.
5596320	5597320	He opened the case.
5597320	5598320	He walked away.
5598320	5599320	I just went, boink.
5599320	5600320	Took him.
5600320	5606320	So on my table, I still have the actual glasses that Goldblum wore.
5610320	5613320	Because I'm a bad person.
5613320	5617320	That is the, you know, I talked about women's rights at one point,
5617320	5621320	and you guys were pretty docile.
5621320	5623320	But stealing, no.
5623320	5624320	Yeah, I'm sorry.
5624320	5625320	I keep them up at my desk.
5625320	5626320	I look at him once in a while and go,
5626320	5629320	those are fucking Dr. Malcolm's glasses, man.
5631320	5632320	You guys.
5632320	5633320	They had his prescriptions in there,
5633320	5635320	so I had them popped out, took them to a lens place
5635320	5637320	and had them put just regular sunglasses in.
5639320	5640320	God damn it.
5640320	5641320	I don't want to derail.
5641320	5642320	What's with that?
5642320	5643320	Okay, we should start.
5643320	5645320	But the fucking Jurassic World trailer came out.
5645320	5649320	And yeah, it was like, I don't know.
5649320	5650320	I don't know.
5650320	5654320	There's somebody, it's not like informed nerds kind of hating on it.
5654320	5656320	Like, it's like, oh, it's going to be bad,
5656320	5658320	but I don't really see any evidence.
5658320	5660320	I mean, what the fuck do you want from a...
5660320	5664320	I wanted that girl not to have a history with the guy.
5664320	5665320	You know what?
5665320	5668320	The girl, she had a history with Chris Pratt that they revealed.
5668320	5669320	That's dumb.
5669320	5671320	That's too doc-connecty to me.
5671320	5675320	Yeah, well, I mean, that's in the trailer?
5675320	5676320	What does she...
5676320	5677320	It was in the thing I saw.
5677320	5678320	I don't know.
5678320	5680320	They released like an extra, like a two-minute scene.
5680320	5681320	Oh, was that not the trailer?
5681320	5683320	That makes more sense if it's not a trailer.
5683320	5686320	Well, Sam Neill is a backstory that is like hatred of children.
5686320	5687320	I mean, like, I don't know.
5687320	5690320	Jurassic Park was a pretty satisfying popcorn movie.
5690320	5693320	And, you know, like in the Michael Creighton tradition of theme parks
5693320	5696320	that seem like great ideas that then go wrong.
5696320	5698320	And what that brings out of people, like,
5698320	5701320	we've had a couple of Jurassic Park sequels that are kind of like off the mark,
5701320	5704320	given that that's what really hits the spot is like,
5704320	5707320	hey, it's a park and then the dinosaurs and then it goes wrong.
5707320	5710320	And it's like the first movie is like, the park's not open yet.
5710320	5713320	The fucking park's open. It seems like a good sequel.
5713320	5715320	I love the permits. I really do.
5715320	5718320	I don't like him like being a raptor whisperer.
5718320	5720320	I don't think you need that.
5720320	5722320	I like the idea of like the park is open.
5722320	5725320	There's a couple thousand visitors and now...
5725320	5726320	Disaster.
5726320	5729320	It's kind of a nice parallel to the first one and then a bigger scale.
5729320	5730320	Yeah.
5730320	5731320	I mean, it's a disaster movie.
5731320	5732320	Just make it...
5732320	5736320	If they made a bigger crazier sea world Jurassic Park,
5736320	5738320	I'd be totally fine with that.
5739320	5742320	It was decades where it was like, we just like to go to the movies
5742320	5746320	and watch like man's ambition just go to shit.
5746320	5749320	It's just fun and there's a couple characters and they're like, get out.
5749320	5751320	You introduce each character.
5751320	5754320	I'm the son of an opera singer.
5754320	5757320	You get really specific, you find these characters
5757320	5761320	and then it's like, you kind of get to pick your own favorite.
5761320	5764320	I hope that that guy dies.
5764320	5767320	Get picked off one by one and then one guy walks away from the whole fucking thing
5767320	5770320	falling apart and goes like, the park is closed.
5771320	5772320	All right.
5772320	5773320	I think that's the movie.
5773320	5777320	Spencer, catch us and scoot her up on the events of last time.
5777320	5778320	I'm sorry.
5778320	5779320	One more thing.
5780320	5782320	Frank Sinatra.
5782320	5785320	This is for Los Angeles people.
5785320	5787320	If anyone that's been to Universal City Walk,
5787320	5793320	do you get high off the shot of the pterodactyls plucking people off
5793320	5795320	because it just looks like the City Walk
5795320	5797320	and it's just like, I've been on that City Walk
5797320	5803320	and I just want like flying lizards to come and just grab random people.
5803320	5804320	All right.
5804320	5805320	Spencer, are you good to go?
5805320	5806320	Yeah.
5806320	5810320	I just want to say that when Dan was telling his story about that male guy,
5810320	5813320	I thought it was a metaphor for like two thirds of the story.
5813320	5815320	No, it really happened.
5815320	5816320	Yeah.
5816320	5817320	There was a guy who...
5817320	5821320	The president is like a mailman with a flying bicycle.
5822320	5824320	And I want to know what's going on with that guy.
5824320	5825320	See, I would vote for that guy.
5825320	5827320	Is that guy in Guantanamo now?
5827320	5828320	Like what?
5828320	5831320	I mean, is he going to die mysteriously when we're not made of shit?
5831320	5833320	He's duct taped to a folding chair somewhere.
5833320	5835320	We should have him on the show.
5835320	5836320	Oh, yeah.
5836320	5839320	And we should get him some D&D books if he's in prison.
5839320	5841320	Don't let me forget about that.
5842320	5844320	Spencer, do we have a guest encapsulator?
5844320	5845320	Yeah.
5845320	5847320	His name was Steven Bassett.
5847320	5848320	And also AIDS.
5849320	5852320	AIDS also wrote this intro.
5852320	5853320	Steven Bassett, you said?
5853320	5854320	I think, yeah.
5854320	5855320	Any relation to Angela?
5855320	5856320	I hope not.
5856320	5857320	All right.
5857320	5858320	Here we go.
5859320	5860320	Damn it.
5862320	5864320	That would be so good.
5865320	5866320	Okay, it's coming up.
5867320	5868320	You're going to do some of that music.
5868320	5869320	Oh, am I?
5869320	5870320	You want to?
5870320	5871320	I don't care.
5872320	5877320	And I don't want to distract everybody, but Spencer told me this is the music he fucks to.
5877320	5884320	So don't, I mean, just try to listen to the recap, but then don't picture that.
5888320	5889320	Yeah.
5894320	5895320	Last time on Heart.
5895320	5901320	After a destroyed but surprisingly effective capture of crime syndicate member Arturo Spagouli,
5902320	5907320	our heroes took turns asking intimidating questions that left the man confused.
5907320	5912320	Nightblade cut through the confusion and with wide eyes and a lacerated hand, Arturo pointed
5912320	5914320	them back to the burger tyrant.
5914320	5919320	At the restaurant, Eve started things off using her stun gloves on the nearby guard,
5919320	5921320	kicking them into cry cooks.
5921320	5926320	Dr. Friend used a magical barrier to trap the enemies while Nightblade found jelly dervish
5926320	5928320	locked in a freezer.
5928320	5931320	Uh, sorry, I'm truncating this a little.
5931320	5932320	This long.
5932320	5937320	Child in tow, the group quickly left the shot up burger tyrant with the Doritos eating hortiguard,
5937320	5942320	driving them away to a distinct dark area somewhere in Seattle.
5942320	5944320	But what will they do when they get there?
5944320	5948320	Did Eve ruin the Poisson butterfly kisses for everyone?
5950320	5953320	Let's find out now.
5954320	5955320	Alright, thank you now.
5959320	5962320	So the whole squad right now, we're all in the van.
5962320	5964320	We got jelly dervish, who's a 10 year old kid, right?
5964320	5965320	Uh, eight?
5965320	5966320	Was he?
5966320	5967320	Sure.
5967320	5968320	I don't know.
5968320	5969320	He's a youngster.
5969320	5970320	Yeah.
5970320	5971320	Um, and he's in the van with us.
5971320	5973320	And you also got Arturo Spagouli in the van.
5973320	5974320	And he's tied up.
5974320	5975320	Right?
5975320	5976320	Yep.
5976320	5977320	And, okay.
5977320	5978320	So are we at the dark area?
5978320	5980320	You're in a dark area.
5981320	5982320	What?
5983320	5985320	Uh, we got jelly dervish.
5985320	5989320	We got to bring him back to, uh, Art Johnson, right?
5989320	5991320	Don't we have to bring him back to our Mr. Johnson?
5991320	5992320	Yeah.
5992320	5993320	Who was that, by the way?
5993320	5994320	That's Arturo talking.
5994320	5995320	Uh, cool.
5995320	5997320	Dave was retired for a while, right?
5997320	5999320	Uh, what?
5999320	6000320	Wait, who's asking?
6000320	6001320	Who's...
6001320	6002320	Oh, just me.
6002320	6003320	Arturo.
6003320	6004320	Oh, no.
6004320	6005320	Don't ask about Art Johnson.
6005320	6006320	Oh.
6006320	6007320	Rude.
6008320	6009320	Just trying to make...
6009320	6010320	Spencer, what was the name of Art Johnson?
6010320	6012320	Uh, what was his name?
6012320	6013320	Ryan Dervish.
6013320	6014320	Ryan Dervish.
6014320	6022320	Um, hey, uh, jelly, we want to bring you back to your dad so we can get paid.
6022320	6023320	You okay with that?
6023320	6024320	Oh, interesting.
6024320	6026320	His dad, you say.
6026320	6027320	Hmm.
6027320	6028320	Who's this talking?
6028320	6029320	Arturo.
6029320	6030320	Okay.
6030320	6031320	All right.
6031320	6032320	You've got the floor.
6032320	6034320	Oh, I'm just listening to your guy's conversation.
6034320	6035320	Don't mind.
6035320	6037320	Seems like you're doing more than that.
6037320	6040320	Seems like a very assertive form of listening.
6041320	6044320	Listening usually takes the form of...
6044320	6045320	I don't know.
6045320	6050320	You don't get to be a mafia man by listening unassertively.
6051320	6055320	So, wait, you're saying you didn't know that this kid was Ryan Dervish's son?
6055320	6060320	No, I just didn't know he hired you guys to, you know, steal him from us.
6060320	6064320	You sound so titillated by that, you're talking like a guy that wants to get whacked.
6064320	6067320	I'm talking about a guy who knows who to whack next.
6067320	6071320	Might I suppose that one of us stays with Spigulli?
6071320	6076320	And also that the rest of us get out of the car and come to some sort of plane?
6078320	6079320	Sounds good to me.
6079320	6080320	Sounds good.
6081320	6082320	So this is what happens.
6082320	6085320	We all get out of the van, except for who's staying.
6085320	6086320	He's tied up.
6086320	6087320	We can just leave him there.
6087320	6088320	I'm good.
6088320	6089320	Someone should stay with him.
6089320	6091320	Just in case.
6091320	6092320	I'll stay with Arturo.
6092320	6093320	This is good.
6093320	6094320	I feel like you guys...
6095320	6099320	There might be a little one-on-one scene coming up with you and Arturo Spigulli.
6099320	6103320	This was sort of Hothagod's plan for entertainment purposes.
6103320	6104320	I see.
6107320	6111320	On the com link, is it possible I might call Dervish and find out where he is?
6111320	6112320	Yeah.
6112320	6113320	This is what I do.
6113320	6115320	Bleep, bleep, bleep.
6116320	6118320	Hey, how's it going?
6118320	6121320	Well, we have your target.
6121320	6123320	That's fantastic.
6125320	6128320	Can you give us some sort of location or give me a fix on where you are?
6128320	6132320	Why don't you mean be at Hank's last stand where we first met?
6135320	6138320	Will you tell those people there to stand the fuck down and leave me alone?
6138320	6140320	Hordegard, are you on the phone?
6140320	6141320	Different place.
6141320	6142320	I'm on the com link.
6142320	6145320	Are you on the com with Ryan Dervish right now?
6145320	6147320	This is exactly what I am.
6147320	6148320	Yeah.
6149320	6154320	Do we want to let him know that we just told Spigulli that he hired us,
6154320	6157320	that that might be sensitive information?
6157320	6161320	For the record, I have shut down my com link on mute for a brief moment.
6161320	6165320	I feel like that might be something he wouldn't want us to have said.
6165320	6167320	It's supposed to be more of a blackout.
6167320	6170320	I think we kind of took the shadow out of the Shadowrun
6170320	6174320	and made it more of a great day marathon.
6174320	6175320	A little marathon.
6175320	6177320	A little time jog.
6177320	6179320	Maybe we could tell him when we get to the place.
6179320	6180320	Where'd he go?
6180320	6181320	Drop him off and then just book it.
6181320	6182320	Probably after the payment.
6182320	6184320	Yeah, of course.
6184320	6187320	He'll probably want to know that.
6187320	6190320	That's why I'll stay with Arturo.
6190320	6197320	One good threat to repercussions deserves another.
6197320	6201320	You can punch that up later while we go drop the kit off.
6201320	6204320	I'm not a writer, I'm a bounty hunter.
6205320	6213320	All right, so I call an Uber to get us and the kid to take us to go drop off.
6213320	6216320	I hate that they out-survived Lyft.
6216320	6218320	They were better, right?
6218320	6222320	Do the robots also harass women?
6222320	6225320	I'm a feminist.
6225320	6228320	And I stole Jeff Goldblum's glasses.
6228320	6232320	No, you didn't, you fucking liar.
6233320	6235320	Just so for our youth.
6235320	6237320	All right, so I call up an Uber.
6237320	6239320	You're already, you have the Uber.
6239320	6242320	Okay, so how far away is Ryan Dervish from us?
6242320	6244320	Oh, not far.
6244320	6250320	With Arturo Spagulli in tow, you arrive at Hank's last stand,
6250320	6252320	your home base sort of thing.
6252320	6255320	It's the old rotten bar.
6255320	6258320	You walk in and you see, there's a guy here,
6258320	6260320	it's normally pretty empty this place,
6260320	6265320	he's wearing a fabulous blue and magenta suit with a face mask
6265320	6267320	and he's got a bow slung over his shoulder.
6267320	6270320	He's just enjoying a glass of water.
6270320	6276320	Can I use my sense of perception to see what sort of dangers might exist?
6276320	6281320	He has the danger of potentially shooting you with one of his arrows in his bow.
6281320	6286320	Other than that, you can't really perceive any dangers.
6286320	6288320	Now, Mercy, you're a face woman.
6288320	6292320	You want to go up there and how do you do this?
6292320	6295320	Yeah, I've got a, was it plus two for impressions?
6295320	6296320	Yes, I do.
6296320	6301320	All right, so I want to walk over to this really bright dude.
6301320	6304320	Hi, what are you doing here?
6304320	6309320	I'm just having a drink, alone.
6312320	6314320	I've never seen you around here before.
6314320	6316320	That's not surprising.
6319320	6321320	What brings you around here in this necklace?
6321320	6323320	It's kind of dark and skeevy around here
6323320	6325320	and you seem like a bright color fellow.
6325320	6328320	Just to meet a friend.
6330320	6333320	I look around to see if Ryan Dervish is in the room.
6333320	6337320	Ryan Dervish, he's talking to Teddy over in the corner.
6337320	6342320	Okay, I guess we should, we'll keep an eye on that guy,
6342320	6347320	but let's go over and drop off the football over to Ryan Dervish.
6347320	6349320	I'll stay with the colorful fellow just in case.
6349320	6355320	Okay, I take, I take, well, you're our negotiator,
6355320	6358320	so maybe she should take her over to Ryan Dervish, right?
6358320	6359320	Or take Jelly over.
6359320	6362320	Whatever you guys want, man.
6362320	6365320	It'd be kind of weird if I walked away from this guy.
6365320	6368320	I think it was kind of going weird.
6369320	6372320	It's weird if you stay there, I think.
6372320	6376320	I'll just say, I'll see him later and I walk away.
6376320	6378320	Say you have to take a shit.
6378320	6381320	I have to go potty. I'll see you later.
6381320	6384320	Oh, nice. Down to the potty.
6384320	6387320	I haven't made contact with him yet, so I can stand casually by.
6387320	6391320	If I see him do anything funny with the bow, I can throw up a physical barrier.
6391320	6392320	That's nice.
6392320	6393320	Nice, Doc.
6393320	6398320	So Doc and I will hang back and keep an eye on Fancy Suit Bow Guy
6398320	6401320	while Mercy goes over and drops off Ryan,
6401320	6404320	and Mercy, don't forget to get that extra money.
6404320	6406320	All right, so we got the kid.
6406320	6409320	Walk over to Teddy and the dude.
6409320	6412320	Oh, you brought up my son to Jelly.
6412320	6414320	Thank you so much.
6414320	6417320	I am overcome with emotion.
6418320	6420320	I'm so glad to hear that.
6420320	6421320	Where's our payment?
6421320	6427320	Was there any mishaps or maybe speed bumps along the way?
6427320	6430320	I will have to say, nah, it's all good.
6430320	6433320	We did everything the way you wanted it to be.
6433320	6434320	Very low-key.
6434320	6437320	It sounds like it. I like that.
6437320	6439320	Here is yours monies.
6442320	6445320	You know, it was kind of a long journey,
6445320	6450320	and we had our expenses, food and water and all that.
6450320	6452320	Dude, it took you a couple hours.
6452320	6453320	I'm really impressed.
6453320	6456320	You spent that much on food and expenses?
6457320	6460320	We had to buy a lot of hamburgers, I think, didn't we?
6460320	6461320	Yeah.
6461320	6463320	You know, it takes a lot to keep up these appearances.
6463320	6466320	We got to look like we're doing something not skeevy.
6466320	6469320	Well, I got to say, when you first took this job, I told you,
6469320	6470320	I was very poor.
6470320	6472320	I did not have a lot of money,
6472320	6476320	and we agreed upon a price based on that basis, you see.
6476320	6478320	That is very true, but we went through a lot
6478320	6480320	just to get your precious, adoring son,
6480320	6483320	who was wonderful the entire way, by the way.
6483320	6486320	And as we agreed, I will pay extra.
6486320	6488320	He takes off his shoe and gives it to you.
6488320	6490320	Oh, he gave us the shoe today.
6490320	6491320	How much money did we get?
6491320	6493320	$500 a piece, I think.
6493320	6494320	And a shoe.
6494320	6495320	Two shoes now.
6495320	6496320	Two shoes now.
6496320	6497320	Oh, we got both shoes.
6497320	6498320	Oh, that's right.
6498320	6499320	Yeah, yeah.
6499320	6500320	It's a full pair.
6500320	6502320	Well, I'm still with Arturo Spiculio.
6502320	6503320	Yeah.
6503320	6504320	And where am I?
6504320	6505320	Well, I thought...
6505320	6506320	In the van.
6506320	6507320	I think you were both in...
6507320	6508320	You were all in the Uber,
6508320	6510320	and you're just in the Uber outside of the bar.
6510320	6512320	So I'm just with him in the Uber.
6512320	6513320	Yeah.
6513320	6514320	And I say, okay.
6514320	6516320	So I go, so...
6516320	6518320	You know about that active listening thing
6518320	6520320	you learned in the mafia?
6520320	6521320	Yeah.
6521320	6524320	And so I learned it too.
6524320	6527320	So, like, I couldn't help but hear
6527320	6529320	that you think that you might whack somebody
6529320	6531320	based on something you heard.
6531320	6532320	I might.
6532320	6535320	Right, so puts you in a weird position now, right?
6535320	6537320	I don't...
6537320	6538320	What do you mean?
6538320	6541320	Well, like, I know that you're going
6541320	6543320	to make me look like a bad employee
6543320	6545320	if I don't kill you.
6545320	6546320	Hmm.
6546320	6549320	So, like, conflict, me...
6549320	6551320	In a world where life means nothing.
6551320	6553320	Well, what...
6553320	6555320	What is it worth it to you?
6555320	6556320	You already got paid, right?
6556320	6558320	Well, what does a bullet cost?
6558320	6559320	Oh.
6560320	6562320	Jesus Christ!
6566320	6569320	Unlike you, my job's based on a reputation.
6569320	6571320	Being a classy guy, you know,
6571320	6572320	people need to be able to trust me.
6572320	6574320	Apparently, you just leave a trail of slime
6574320	6575320	wherever you go.
6575320	6577320	You know, you'll fuck over anybody.
6577320	6581320	Hologuard has simultaneously on comlink
6581320	6583320	called up another ruber
6583320	6587320	and then also lifted his rifle just in case.
6588320	6590320	Another ruber?
6590320	6591320	Rifle.
6591320	6592320	Uber.
6592320	6593320	Uber.
6593320	6594320	Okay, sorry.
6594320	6595320	Why don't we just boil it down to this?
6595320	6597320	I mean, I feel like in a world of muck
6597320	6599320	where my job is to rake through shit
6599320	6600320	and make money doing it,
6600320	6602320	I had this one job where I rescue a kid
6602320	6604320	and bring him back to his dad,
6604320	6606320	and you're attempting to make that job dirty,
6606320	6608320	and all I gotta do to clean it up is
6608320	6610320	shoot one piece of shit.
6610320	6613320	And, you know, destroy a lot of security footage.
6613320	6614320	Sorry, what?
6614320	6616320	I'm just saying.
6616320	6619320	Face is all over the place in that burger tyrant.
6619320	6622320	So you're saying you're not the only link
6622320	6624320	between, you know, this rescue mission
6624320	6626320	and Jelly's father?
6627320	6628320	No, no, I'm not.
6628320	6632320	There's all sorts of technology that protects, you know, us.
6632320	6634320	So in other words, if I were to take an active interest
6634320	6637320	in the long, happy life of Jelly and his father,
6637320	6640320	I would have to be very vigilant.
6640320	6642320	Yeah, I'd say that.
6642320	6646320	So I would do that either by having security cameras of my own
6646320	6649320	and constantly spending a lot of money on that,
6649320	6652320	or as one man who's able to get you in the back of a car,
6652320	6655320	I could just say to you, say to your friends,
6655320	6658320	if anything ever happens,
6658320	6660320	it would be bad for everybody all the time.
6660320	6662320	They would never know when.
6662320	6663320	They'd be taking a bath.
6663320	6665320	I'd be the rubber ducky.
6669320	6671320	They would be eating burgers in a restaurant.
6671320	6673320	I'd be the mayonnaise.
6674320	6676320	My name is Jim Nightblade.
6676320	6678320	Do one more scenario.
6678320	6681320	Do like three or four more of those.
6682320	6684320	They'd be at the movies,
6684320	6686320	a guy'd be going, yup.
6687320	6688320	And they'd go, who's that?
6688320	6691320	And it'd be me, and my popcorn would be a gun.
6691320	6695320	I'm just saying, like, I keep a backlog.
6695320	6696320	Like, I'm not like you.
6696320	6700320	I don't spin a web and like draw the joy from other people.
6700320	6703320	I'm on the run, and I go from job to job.
6703320	6704320	When I do a job for somebody,
6704320	6707320	and the job is to keep their son alive, I check back.
6707320	6710320	If I check back, I hold you accountable.
6710320	6713320	You're like my employee now,
6713320	6716320	and my payment is your life.
6716320	6718320	You deal with the security cameras.
6718320	6722320	You deal with all that, because if anything ever happens,
6722320	6725320	like it's you that gets fired first, air quotes,
6725320	6726320	and I'm fired.

6737320	6739320	and you have a phenomenon stroke.
6739320	6742320	It'll just be like, I'll take you into a warehouse
6742320	6745320	and I'll take shit out on you.
6747320	6752320	I'll use you as an excuse to vent things that all men have inside them.
6754320	6756320	You know what they do in prison, right?
6756320	6759320	They look at child rapists, and they go like,
6759320	6762320	oh, finally, a reason to be who we are.
6764320	6766320	This world's a prison.
6766320	6768320	You're a pedophile.
6769320	6771320	Cliffhanger!
6773320	6775320	That's not a cliffhanger.
