0	8720	Yeah, make some noise for yourself for coming into downtown Los Angeles.
8720	14280	Ladies and gentlemen, Harman Town is now in session.
14280	17200	How are you tonight?
17200	18780	You look so much better than that.
18780	21280	How are you tonight?
21280	23280	Yeah.
24280	29280	Let me bring to the stage the master king of all he surveys,
29280	33280	gamer king, Spencer Crittenden.
40280	42280	Couldn't do a show without him.
42280	46280	Lord knows he needs to hear you give him some claps when he gets out here.
46280	52280	Ladies and gentlemen, the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
54280	57280	I am Brandon Johnson.
57280	60280	Yeah, rap to the east, rap to the west,
60280	62280	rap to your knees, rap to your chest,
62280	65280	rap to your feet, rap to your shoes,
65280	67280	rap to the rhythm and the news.
67280	68280	What?
68280	71280	He thought I was going to say blues, but I mixed it up.
71280	73280	Ain't it the same thing, Dan?
73280	75280	No.
76280	79280	That was just me realizing how offbeat I was the whole time.
79280	82280	Like, no, okay.
82280	85280	Thank you for coming.
91280	92280	All right.
92280	94280	Well, let's get down.
94280	95280	Yeah.
95280	96280	Not a lot to share.
96280	97280	I don't know.
97280	100280	She's been working hard.
100280	102280	You know, it's fun.
102280	104280	Yeah, you're back, back, back, right?
104280	106280	What week is this?
106280	108280	Is this like four weeks in of Rick and Morty?
108280	109280	It's a little more than that.
109280	113280	But now it's like really like in stage, I'm like, oh, it's good to be back to work.
113280	119280	But now it's really like, I mean, where things are running like a fucking machine.
119280	122280	And I'm not going to lie, it is a new thing for me.
122280	128280	Like, it's just, it really is continuing to be this thing where I'm like,
128280	130280	are you going to fuck this up?
130280	132280	Like, it's up to you to fuck this up.
132280	133280	Like, just like what?
133280	135280	And that's when your religion comes into it.
135280	138280	You're like, do I believe that the universe is structured in a way
138280	143280	that if everything is going okay for a week, that it has to go to fucking shit
143280	144280	and get all fucked up.
144280	147280	Like, you either have to believe that.
147280	153280	And it's like, is it okay to just be like, well, maybe your definition
153280	156280	of things getting fucked up will elevate or something.
156280	157280	I don't know.
157280	158280	Yes.
158280	159280	I haven't figured it out.
159280	160280	Higher end fucking up.
160280	163280	But I do know that it's not supposed to be you.
163280	167280	If you have no shoes for a week, I'm going to riff a metaphor.
167280	168280	It's going to go good.
168280	169280	I'm going to nail this.
169280	172280	You have no shoes for a week.
172280	174280	And then you're like, this is pretty fucked up.
174280	175280	But it's normal.
175280	179280	So during that week, you're like, I got no shoes and Maggie likes me.
179280	181280	And she's like, hi, Lloyd.
181280	182280	And you're like, no shoes, Lloyd.
182280	184280	That's what they call me.
184280	186280	We don't have really caveman names.
186280	187280	Who said we were cavemen?
187280	188280	What kind of image?
188280	189280	Just because I have no shoes.
189280	190280	There's lots of people that don't have them.
190280	191280	Maybe we're in a weird country.
191280	192280	A weird country?
192280	193280	Our names are Maggie and Lloyd.
193280	196280	Can we not get into this, Maggie, you fucking bitch?
197280	199280	You have to pick everything apart and problematize it.
199280	201280	I got no shoes.
201280	208280	And so then you go home and go, you say to your living girlfriend who always knew Maggie
208280	212280	was probably an issue, but also you guys have an understanding because you knew.
212280	213280	It was like you moved.
213280	214280	You moved in actually more out of convenience.
214280	218280	And so anyways, you're not dishonest, but she's like, how was your day?
218280	221280	Like shitty, gotten a little tussle.
221280	222280	What was it, Maggie?
222280	223280	Because you want to fuck her.
223280	224280	No.
225280	226280	I got no shoes.
226280	228280	And then she's like, this is starting about names.
228280	230280	And you're like, so you had a bad week, right?
230280	232280	And you go like, OK, I had a bad week.
232280	235280	No shoes guy had a bad week.
235280	236280	OK.
236280	238280	I think this metaphor is still going to work correctly.
238280	239280	You got this.
239280	242280	So then the next week you wake up.
242280	245280	There's shoes.
245280	250280	Let's say you have a caveman holiday called Shoomis.
250280	252280	All cavemen get shoes.
252280	253280	No, correction.
253280	255280	None of the cavemen get shoes.
255280	256280	Most of them get a BB gun.
256280	258280	You get shoes.
258280	259280	You know why?
259280	260280	Because you're a good caveman.
260280	261280	You did your fucking time.
261280	262280	You deserve shoes.
262280	264280	What are you going to do with a BB gun?
264280	267280	There's mammoth out there.
267280	268280	I know my history.
268280	269280	I know my anthropology.
269280	271280	Don't fuck with me.
271280	272280	So you put on the shoes.
272280	274280	Now you're now you're fucking rolling.
274280	277280	These are the Tesla of cavemen shoes.
277280	278280	Yes.
278280	279280	And you're like, wow, feels good.
279280	282280	Like rattlesnakes can't bite me.
282280	285280	Sabretooth tigers can't outrun me.
285280	286280	Okay.
286280	287280	I'm sure they can outrun me.
287280	289280	That's like, you know, you're why.
289280	290280	You know what?
290280	294280	Listen, I don't owe you this explanation, but I'll say this.
294280	300280	90% sabretooth tiger deaths happen because the caveman in the midst of creeping by the
300280	304280	sabretooth tiger went, ow, because he stepped on a sharp stone.
304280	307280	That's a fact.
307280	309280	So shoes means life.
309280	311280	It means you're lucky.
311280	312280	You're privileged.
312280	314280	I got, I had no shoes.
314280	315280	I was, what was my name?
315280	316280	Lloyd.
316280	317280	Yep.
317280	318280	The caveman.
318280	319280	I now have shoes.
319280	324280	So if Lloyd starts to think, okay, now I got shoes.
324280	332280	So now that means, right, that I'm going to get caveman cancer.
332280	334280	That doesn't do anybody any good.
334280	335280	That's not a good thing for him to think.
335280	337280	That's not even his expertise.
337280	341280	We'd rather him think about other things, like the light bulb hasn't been invented.
341280	346280	You're saying when Lloyd had no shoes, his fear was the tiger, the sabretooth.
346280	347280	Yeah.
347280	350280	But then when Lloyd got shoes, his new fear was cancer.
350280	351280	Caveman cancer.
351280	357280	And I think, you know, look, I am the first person to agree that Lloyd's podcast is going
357280	363280	to get a little less entertaining once he stops going to the ins and outs of his fear
363280	364280	of sabretooth tigers.
364280	367280	I do agree that that was a big part of the appeal.
367280	374280	But, you know, assuming that podcasts aren't what keep us happy and alive, you shouldn't
374280	379280	be like, oh, God, a cave anvil is going to fall on my head.
379280	381280	But Lloyd lived with a girlfriend.
381280	384280	Well, but did that sound like a happy relationship?
384280	388280	What do they mean they're living together but they're what?
388280	389280	Come on.
389280	390280	I mean.
390280	393280	That sounded like they needed to take that to a cave couple therapist.
394280	398280	Perhaps the thing that will keep Lloyd from worrying about cancer is the fact that he's
398280	401280	got people around him who are also worried.
402280	403280	Oh, wait.
403280	404280	Oh, that was a left turn.
404280	405280	Okay.
405280	406280	That was a left turn.
406280	407280	You thought I was going to say blues, didn't you?
407280	412280	He was to take his shoes and run as far away that he had to go to a place where there's
412280	417280	no tigers or people and just be in a field and like lay down and die from sleeping too
417280	420280	much and make great television.
420280	422280	That's always been a part of it.
422280	426280	I've never, ever, ever said like I've never look, I've been doing this for 20 years.
426280	428280	I have never made the television.
428280	429280	I make part of anyone's problem.
429280	430280	I've never done that.
430280	435280	Like I, I, I, you find me an episode of a TV, the thing I produce where it's like,
435280	438280	oh, I can see someone's upset about Twinkies.
438280	441280	You know, I don't, I don't fucking that's to hack shit.
441280	443280	Like I fucking like blow your mind.
443280	446280	I tell you timeless stories about struggles and humanity.
446280	447280	Shoes.
448280	453280	I use these great metaphors to like reveal things about, I don't even remember where
453280	454280	I'm going.
454280	457280	I'm trying to, I'm just saying this is part, part three.
457280	460280	I think since they, since I revealed that I'm too happy.
460280	461280	Yeah.
461280	462280	It's a problem.
462280	463280	Okay.
463280	466280	But you're getting, here's the good thing about getting happy is you're getting happier
466280	468280	as your problem grows.
468280	471280	Well, I'm excited to talk about it because it feels like also in your therapist goes,
471280	472280	you need to learn how to be happy.
472280	474280	And you're like, you mean Bragg?
475280	478280	Cause I was told that's how you get cancer.
480280	483280	And she's like, no, that's not how you get cancer.
483280	484280	Who are you?
484280	489280	You mean like Jack Ruby comes to the prison and like, or wait, no, Jack Ruby got injected
489280	490280	with cancer, right?
490280	492280	Cause he, uh, Kennedy.
492280	493280	Okay.
493280	495280	Do you think you're going to win?
495280	497280	Uh, Jack Ruby.
497280	498280	Yeah.
498280	500280	Do you think you're going to win the happiness battle?
500280	501280	Cause it's, it's not.
501280	502280	No.
502280	503280	You know what?
503280	504280	I have a feeling, you know what?
504280	505280	I think it's going to happen.
505280	509280	I think my body's going to start, uh, dying.
509280	512280	Uh, and we'll dress it up.
512280	520280	We'll call it a stroke or, uh, or, uh, or a lung collapse or, uh, or a gout.
520280	525280	Um, and then, oh, and then everyone will go, oh, he's dying.
525280	528280	And then I'll go, oh, don't worry about me.
528280	529280	I lived a good life.
529280	531280	Why are you all talking like that?
531280	532280	I don't know.
532280	535280	Cause you know, I don't want to, I don't want to mock it before we get there.
535280	538280	I'm telling you home, I want to be by some flowers.
538280	540280	I heard you were dying.
540280	543280	Don't you think winning is, I guess, I guess I'm like nine years old.
543280	545280	Like don't you think winning is like, you don't die.
545280	547280	That's what, like that's the every game you play.
547280	549280	Like tag, you're it.
549280	551280	You lost tag.
551280	552280	I'm never it.
552280	554280	I won forever.
554280	557280	Should you play hide and seek and you stick yourself into a storm drain?
557280	559280	It doesn't matter if snails are crawling over your face.
559280	562280	You won hide and seek.
562280	564280	But you lost at life.
564280	569280	Well, tell that to the person who said life was about being sought.
569280	573280	Tell that to Professor Seikman and his fucking model of the universe.
573280	577280	I just want to see you coming out from under a bush with slugs on your face going, I won.
577280	578280	Oh man.
578280	579280	I was the king of that shit.
579280	581280	Like they would play flashlight tag.
581280	585280	I'm like, I will go where no light will go.
585280	586280	See?
586280	589280	For you to brash in my lungs and a smile on my face.
589280	591280	We want flashlight tag.
591280	592280	We lost.
592280	593280	We sure did, buddy.
593280	595280	We sure did.
595280	596280	You hid somewhere.
596280	599280	Some people were afraid to shine a flashlight.
599280	602280	Congratulations.
602280	603280	The joke on you.
603280	605280	Everyone just wants to stop playing.
605280	608280	There's girls here.
608280	609280	Yeah.
609280	610280	I would hide.
610280	611280	I knew how to hide.
611280	613280	We talked about this.
613280	617280	You guys think when you're a kid, you're not claustrophobic.
617280	621280	We used to hide in weird cupboards and shit.
621280	624280	We'd be like, weirder the better.
624280	629280	Tuck your leg and be like, man, I wish I could lock this from the outside so that nobody
629280	631280	could swallow the key.
631280	634280	Your instinct is to never be found.
634280	638280	I think it's because you're a kid and you don't know that that's a coffin.
639280	644280	You're at a certain age, I'm going to say 17 or something.
644280	649280	You're not quite gripping mortality, but you watch your first serpent in the rainbow movie
649280	653280	and you're like, how come that guy's going like this and screaming and inside of the
653280	654280	coffin?
654280	658280	That forces you to go, I'm going to have to decode why this character's acting like this.
658280	659280	All right.
659280	660280	I'm in a box.
660280	661280	I can't get out.
661280	662280	There's nothing but...
662280	663280	Oh, God!
663280	664280	Jesus!
664280	665280	Oh, fuck!
665280	666280	Oh, fuck!
666280	667280	Oh, God!
667280	668280	I'll end up dead!
668280	671280	Oh, my God, being unable to move.
671280	674280	I got to a point...
674280	677280	Dan's grabbing his sunglasses.
677280	679280	We do a podcast part, too.
679280	682280	Did you say that they're $300?
682280	684280	Oh, they're $300.
688280	690280	Dan threw them into the ice.
690280	692280	I bought them on New Year's Eve.
692280	695280	I was already high.
696280	699280	The store wasn't open late.
699280	704280	The sun was out, obviously, or I wouldn't have...
704280	706280	But I was like, I'm high.
706280	707280	That was a good day.
707280	709280	I like New Year's Eve.
709280	714280	You started it out getting high and then were like, I'm so high I should get some sunglasses.
714280	715280	Yeah.
715280	718280	I went into Fred Siegel with my girlfriend and I was like, let's get some crazy shit
718280	719280	for tonight.
719280	721280	And then I was like, how about some sunglasses?
721280	723280	Yeah, but what about being rich?
723280	725280	And I was like, what if they were $300?
725280	728280	And I was like, maybe I'll wear them again.
730280	734280	My $1,000 glasses that helped me see, because those are gone.
734280	735280	I don't know where those are.
735280	736280	I lost those.
736280	737280	Yeah.
737280	738280	It's not your problem.
738280	739280	Well, it's hard.
739280	740280	Like, I don't know.
740280	742280	That's why I wore my glasses all the time.
742280	744280	I was supposed to just wear them while I was driving.
744280	747280	But then it's like you have to carry a case or some shit.
747280	749280	It's like, well, I'm not going to do any of this.
749280	751280	I don't understand.
751280	753280	I know the answer is 100%.
753280	757280	I'm not going to ask how many of my audience wears glasses.
757280	759280	I know it's 100%.
759280	762280	But of you, how many of you, let's say by applause,
762280	768280	how many of you walk around with a case for your glasses?
768280	769280	Yeah.
769280	770280	That's a lot.
770280	771280	That feels healthy.
771280	774280	I don't think all of those people are serial killers.
774280	775280	Right.
775280	777280	That's good moral applause.
777280	778280	Yeah.
778280	779280	I understand.
779280	780280	I paid it.
780280	781280	I lost $1,000.
781280	784280	I went and got things that cost $1,000.
784280	787280	And I treat them like they're garbage, but they're not.
787280	788280	They're $1,000.
788280	790280	It's almost like the case makes them harder.
790280	795280	You're just doing it to make them bulkier so that you don't lose them.
795280	796280	But yeah.
796280	798280	I mean, that's so you could put it in your pocket or whatever,
798280	800280	but I'm never going to do anything like that.
800280	802280	So it's just like holding a small log or something.
802280	803280	It's dumb.
803280	805280	I just feel like an asshole.
805280	807280	They get to figure this shit out.
807280	808280	Or do they?
808280	811280	They're rich and we can't see.
811280	812280	Yeah.
812280	814280	They get us right where they want us.
814280	820280	Our next guest is we want to, by popular demand,
820280	823280	a lot of people said last episode, they're like, Dan, that was amazing.
823280	824280	Wow.
824280	829280	It's just amazing and wow.
829280	830280	Awesome.
830280	832280	Where were you, by the way?
832280	834280	Do you understand that every time you're not here,
834280	839280	fucking Schwab is out of control.
839280	840280	Is that true?
840280	841280	Yeah.
841280	842280	Did you listen to it?
842280	843280	He can't.
843280	846280	I'll be like, you know what's crazy about mortality?
846280	849280	It's like, ah, mortality.
849280	852280	And I'm just like, you need that.
852280	854280	You can't compete with that.
854280	857280	And then they're all like, he's great.
857280	859280	I can't argue with that.
859280	862280	If I argue with that, I'm a bad guy.
863280	865280	But then I'm like, what was the quintessential one?
865280	869280	I was like, oh, do you think about death as a human?
869280	872280	And he's like, as a human, you're not an animal.
872280	873280	You're a human.
873280	877280	And he just went off for like, you know how he does that thing where it doesn't,
877280	880280	he doesn't wait to see if it worked or not.
880280	884280	He just leans in and that's why it works.
884280	885280	Yeah.
885280	888280	Because if he did it and it didn't work and then he leaned in,
888280	889280	you'd be like, no sale.
889280	890280	But he just fucking leans in.
890280	893280	He's like, he's like, you go, hey, do you understand?
893280	896280	As opposed to over sit, as opposed to over sit,
896280	898280	as opposed to over sit.
898280	900280	Understand, not over sit.
900280	902280	Over sit, over sit.
902280	905280	As opposed to over sit.
905280	909280	You said understand, but did you say over sit?
909280	911280	See, it worked on you.
911280	920280	But now try this one.
920280	921280	Hey, do you understand?
921280	925280	You mean as opposed to over sit?
925280	929280	Well, you're laughing because you're laughing at the fact that I nailed it.
929280	930280	My point.
930280	938280	Anyways, all right.
938280	943280	Let's bring out the kid from the alley from last week is what I was talking about.
943280	945280	Mr. Jeff Davis is here.
945280	956280	Yes!
956280	957280	Jeff Davis, ladies and gentlemen.
957280	965280	Jeff Davis.
965280	975280	Oh, no.
975280	980280	I thought you were going to bring out Shropp.
980280	982280	No, because that wouldn't have worked.
982280	983280	See, I'm a craftsman.
983280	984280	I don't care.
984280	985280	Like, I'm helping him.
985280	988280	I'm like, what would help Shropp in terms of timing?
988280	990280	Like, don't do that.
990280	991280	And then he did that.
991280	993280	I was like, well, let's buffer it.
993280	1001280	I had some work done.
1001280	1004280	I had a coollectomy.
1004280	1006280	And I don't want it.
1006280	1008280	You took the cool out of yourself.
1008280	1009280	Yeah.
1009280	1012280	So I don't know why I would just mitigate it.
1013280	1023280	I told the story on this podcast of, like, I had a therapist.
1023280	1024280	And I was telling...
1024280	1027280	I know I told this, but I was talking about my childhood.
1027280	1030280	And then I looked up, and she had, like, tears coming down her face.
1030280	1031280	And I was like, why are you crying?
1031280	1033280	She's like, well, it's a very emotional story.
1033280	1034280	I'm like, no, it's not.
1034280	1035280	It's not.
1035280	1036280	And I'm not being a Klingon.
1036280	1038280	I'm like, I'll tell you what's emotional.
1038280	1040280	I'm a fucking professional storyteller.
1041280	1043280	And she's like, well, I don't know.
1043280	1045280	Maybe not to you.
1045280	1047280	Professional therapist.
1047280	1049280	I think I know what's powerful.
1049280	1050280	And I was like, all right.
1050280	1051280	Well, see you again.
1051280	1052280	Same time next week.
1052280	1053280	Been with it.
1053280	1054280	Came back next time.
1054280	1057280	And she was talking about, oh, how's your thing with your sled?
1057280	1058280	No, that's great.
1058280	1059280	It says Rosebud on it.
1059280	1060280	It was going through.
1060280	1064280	I'm making up a therapy session.
1064280	1067280	What if in Citizen Kane he just had a therapist?
1067280	1069280	Like, in the middle of the movie, he's just like, I had this sled.
1069280	1070280	It's Rosebud.
1070280	1071280	And she's like, well, see.
1074280	1075280	He's like, you know what?
1075280	1076280	I'm going to go home to my wife.
1076280	1077280	Tell her it's OK for her to go out.
1077280	1080280	She was crying for less than honest reasons.
1080280	1084280	So then she, yeah, she goes like, by the way,
1084280	1085280	really embarrassed about this.
1085280	1087280	You asked about the tears coming down my face.
1087280	1090280	I had had some work done.
1090280	1092280	And I was embarrassed because it's a vanity thing.
1092280	1094280	So I lied in the moment.
1094280	1095280	And I feel bad about that.
1095280	1098280	And I said, well, I probably didn't say.
1098280	1103280	But I said the way we say in our heads when we're just going to walk away
1103280	1104280	and never go back.
1104280	1105280	You mean you were like?
1105280	1106280	Yeah.
1106280	1107280	I was like.
1107280	1108280	You were all like.
1108280	1111280	Were you all like or were you just like?
1111280	1115280	I think I was nothing like because I think I was like, OK, sure.
1115280	1116280	I just never went back.
1116280	1122280	But I'm like, you mean you, more importantly, you like.
1122280	1123280	Like I said, why are you crying?
1123280	1127280	And you were like, specifically because of the emotional quality
1127280	1132280	of the story you pay me to listen to and understand and analyze.
1132280	1133280	Like that's fucked up.
1133280	1134280	Yeah.
1134280	1137280	Like lying is if your plumber comes over and he's like, oh, it looks like
1137280	1138280	you took a big shit.
1138280	1139280	And you're like, don't judge.
1139280	1140280	And he's like, I won't.
1140280	1141280	I'm a plumber.
1141280	1143280	I'm just going to get the shit out and you give me 50 bucks and I'll be gone.
1143280	1144280	I'm sorry to offend plumbers.
1144280	1148280	I don't mean to make your occupation sound cheap or fucking craftless.
1148280	1149280	I know it's hard.
1149280	1152280	But I was in Boston.
1152280	1160280	And but but but but but but but while he's doing it, if he's like,
1160280	1163280	and you're and you're like, hey, plumber, why are you crying?
1163280	1165280	And he's like nothing.
1165280	1169280	And you're like, well, OK.
1169280	1175280	But it's fucked up if he goes, just your shit stinks.
1175280	1176280	That's that's fucked up.
1176280	1178280	He doesn't have to do that.
1178280	1187280	He could say I watched Roots last night.
1187280	1192280	And then to come back a week later to fix your sink and be like, you shit
1192280	1195280	didn't stink that bad.
1195280	1197280	I just had some work done.
1197280	1202280	And that one place maybe I'd be like, well, that's a pretty honest plumber.
1202280	1203280	Like you didn't have to.
1203280	1205280	You could have because all shit stinks.
1205280	1207280	I'd be like, OK, that's cool.
1207280	1210280	You can keep plunging everything.
1210280	1213280	But the therapy, then that's where the metaphor breaks down.
1213280	1215280	Did you keep her?
1215280	1216280	No. Oh, good.
1216280	1217280	OK. No.
1217280	1225280	Nor nor did I like say I'm firing you because like I just didn't show up.
1225280	1228280	That's what I did with all my therapists is like, I just did not show up.
1228280	1232280	How is your current therapist relationship going right now?
1232280	1233280	Fantastic.
1233280	1234280	Yes. So good.
1234280	1235280	You guys get along.
1235280	1236280	Oh, I mean, get along.
1236280	1238280	No, fuck that.
1238280	1239280	She's just fucking good.
1239280	1241280	Did Rocky get along with Burgess Meredith?
1241280	1242280	Yes.
1242280	1244280	No, he made him chase a chicken.
1244280	1246280	That's not what a friend does.
1246280	1249280	He told him he was going to eat lightning and shit thunder.
1249280	1254280	He told him that from out of a moving car that he was making him chase.
1254280	1256280	Like it's not a friendship.
1256280	1258280	It's more valuable than that.
1258280	1260280	You're going to do great, kid.
1260280	1261280	Come on. You're a bum.
1261280	1262280	I'm not a bum.
1262280	1265280	You know, like it's friendship is for pussy.
1265280	1270280	Has your therapist ever told you that you might get murdered to death?
1270280	1272280	By Mr. T.
1272280	1274280	That's Rocky too.
1274280	1279280	No, but my therapist told me I have a 50% chance of suicide given my...
1279280	1280280	Right.
1280280	1283280	And tonight you said you weren't going to learn how to be happy,
1283280	1285280	which was the other alternative, right?
1285280	1287280	Wait, no. Did I say that? I didn't say that.
1287280	1289280	I thought you said you weren't going to find out how to be happy.
1289280	1291280	Who says that? That's crazy.
1291280	1293280	I was so... That's why I clocked it.
1293280	1298280	I was like, write this down and don't like follow up on this.
1298280	1301280	Yeah, I don't... I mean, I didn't mean to say...
1301280	1303280	Good, because don't die.
1303280	1308280	We don't give Spencer that fancy a desk to not remember things.
1308280	1312280	Ask yourself if I've ever done anything cool,
1312280	1316280	and before you worry if I'm just going to kill myself without any...
1316280	1318280	You're not going to kill yourself.
1318280	1319280	No, I'm not worried about that.
1319280	1320280	Because suicide isn't cool.
1320280	1324280	What I mean is, have I ever done anything restrained or like, you know, like,
1324280	1326280	I don't know what I'm going to do next week.
1326280	1328280	I'm going to kill myself.
1328280	1331280	Like, I'm not capable of that level of...
1331280	1332280	You're not going to kill yourself.
1332280	1335280	You're going to get killed by the alt-right, and we all know that.
1338280	1340280	Spencer's desk is backwards.
1340280	1342280	Yeah, it's this...
1344280	1346280	We've discussed this.
1346280	1349280	Because this looks like a backwards desk.
1349280	1352280	Yeah, but that's the whole point, right?
1352280	1354280	Well, think of it this way.
1354280	1358280	What do you think is behind, like, on the back of this desk?
1358280	1360280	Drawers.
1360280	1362280	Well, what do you think is on the front?
1362280	1364280	Fake drawers.
1364280	1367280	You think there's drawers on both sides?
1368280	1370280	No, I think there's real drawers in the back where you are.
1370280	1372280	I think there's fake drawers on the front.
1372280	1373280	Well, that's where you're...
1373280	1375280	Well, that's where you're wrong.
1376280	1378280	Oh, shit!
1378280	1380280	Wait, what? Why is there...?
1380280	1382280	Now get ready to have your mind really blown.
1382280	1383280	Oh, shit.
1383280	1386280	Jeff, I think there's fake drawers on the back.
1387280	1389280	What?
1391280	1393280	This is just like... Oh, man.
1393280	1397280	This is just like the Neil Patrick Harris Oscars or whatever.
1397280	1399280	Do you guys remember that?
1399280	1402280	And everyone's like, how did they know when they pre-planned the whole show
1402280	1404280	what would happen on the show?
1405280	1407280	This could never happen.
1407280	1410280	How could all these actors do pre-scripted things?
1411280	1413280	On camera.
1413280	1415280	This is magic.
1416280	1418280	And I was like, why is anyone impressed?
1418280	1421280	And people were like, what the fuck are you talking about?
1421280	1424280	And I was like, you don't see what's happening?
1424280	1426280	Acting.
1426280	1427280	Okay.
1427280	1429280	That's been building for years.
1434280	1438280	I like our audience.
1438280	1442280	I'm just so glad that you said it inside this time.
1442280	1444280	Not out in the street like the first time.
1444280	1446280	No, I know.
1446280	1449280	He closed his own drawers.
1451280	1455280	I like our audience because what they applied is the confessional
1455280	1457280	that's been building for years.
1457280	1459280	A lesser podcast.
1459280	1462280	They've just been applauding after the rant about the thing.
1462280	1465280	But then they liked that and then they waited and he said,
1465280	1467280	that's been building for years.
1467280	1469280	And they said, we love you.
1469280	1470280	I like them.
1470280	1471280	Well, okay.
1471280	1472280	And they don't like being praised.
1472280	1473280	Fuck you.
1473280	1474280	I like that too.
1474280	1475280	Do you deal with it?
1475280	1479280	And maybe this is a bad thing to back control on.
1479280	1482280	We haven't brought up an audience member out of the audience
1482280	1484280	on stage in a long time.
1484280	1485280	Shit.
1485280	1487280	Someone gasped at that.
1489280	1491280	Probably the worst guest we could ever...
1491280	1492280	Don't you think...
1493280	1494280	Because don't you think...
1494280	1496280	It's usually good if somebody's like,
1496280	1498280	oh, my dad died and now he does this.
1498280	1501280	But somebody that's like, I was just saying...
1502280	1504280	There's a good chance that person is...
1504280	1505280	Is it Adam Goldberg?
1505280	1506280	No.
1506280	1508280	No, no, we didn't mean that.
1509280	1510280	But don't you...
1510280	1511280	What about...
1511280	1512280	What about Schwab?
1512280	1513280	What about Schwab?
1513280	1515280	Oh, shit.
1515280	1518280	Rob Schwab!
1518280	1519280	Watch your voice.
1519280	1521280	Rob Schwab.
1521280	1522280	Rob Schwab.
1522280	1523280	Oh, shit.
1523280	1524280	Rob Schwab.
1524280	1525280	Rob Schwab.
1525280	1526280	Rob Schwab.
1526280	1527280	Rob Schwab.
1527280	1528280	Rob Schwab.
1528280	1529280	Rob Schwab.
1529280	1530280	Rob Schwab.
1530280	1533280	What if Schwab was one of us?
1533280	1536280	That's a complicated visual dance.
1536280	1538280	Hard to describe.
1539280	1541280	Steve Levy in two doors.
1541280	1545280	Really, really taking me to task earlier.
1545280	1548280	I'm gonna deconstructed you a little bit.
1549280	1551280	It's within my rights.
1551280	1554280	That's all I do, is just say things loud.
1554280	1555280	I didn't say that.
1555280	1556280	I did not say that.
1556280	1558280	Did you guys hear how strong my voice was just now?
1558280	1560280	I was so worried.
1560280	1562280	I was like, you can't be doing this, man.
1562280	1566280	No, I'm allowed to have a strong voice until I feel like I'm tired.
1566280	1567280	Oh.
1567280	1570280	Oh, my fucking back.
1575280	1577280	Well, Levy, can we...
1577280	1584280	Levy, can we get Schwab a sarcastically comfortable easy chair for next week?
1584280	1586280	So he can just be my dad.
1586280	1588280	Journey can be complete.
1588280	1591280	We should have just a Barca lounger out here for him.
1591280	1595280	Can we just then show you Millbrook's movies throughout my podcast?
1595280	1598280	And you can just go, hey, hey, hey.
1598280	1600280	Now, that's funny.
1601280	1602280	I don't know.
1602280	1603280	For that.
1603280	1605280	I'll do that.
1606280	1608280	Oh, look at this.
1608280	1609280	Thank you.
1609280	1611280	That looks great.
1611280	1613280	So let's compare.
1613280	1615280	Is this better or worse than the last chair?
1615280	1619280	I'm going to say better.
1620280	1625280	Because my feet are on the floor and you're reaching for the stars.
1627280	1631280	This could be fun later on in the show.
1631280	1632280	What?
1632280	1633280	This little crack here.
1633280	1634280	Oh.
1634280	1637280	Looks like it's half built.
1637280	1639280	I think my phone's going to go dead.
1639280	1640280	Oh, no.
1640280	1642280	Oh, no.
1642280	1643280	Now what?
1643280	1644280	Now what?
1644280	1645280	The show.
1645280	1646280	But with the show.
1646280	1647280	Quick, hurry.
1647280	1650280	Do the show before it runs out.
1652280	1655280	You see through it now, don't you?
1655280	1658280	I just want to share that my dad remembered the Dadfished episode.
1658280	1660280	I texted my dad during the show because everyone's like,
1661280	1662280	Oh, yeah.
1662280	1664280	He did text back and I wanted to...
1664280	1665280	What did he say?
1665280	1667280	Do it in his voice.
1668280	1671280	Now, is this your actual dad that texted?
1671280	1672280	Yes.
1672280	1674280	Because you didn't change his heath back, right?
1674280	1677280	Monday, July 16th, 851 p.m.
1677280	1679280	I was here with you.
1679280	1684280	You made me text my dad because apparently the following exchange
1684280	1687280	was standing between me and emotional fulfillment.
1687280	1690280	I said, my show got nominated for an Emmy exclamation point
1690280	1693280	and Tuesday, July 17th, he texted back,
1693280	1695280	Fucking fantastic.
1696280	1697280	Yeah.
1704280	1706280	You're healed.
1706280	1707280	Yeah.
1707280	1709280	Did he say, what else is new?
1709280	1712280	No, I mean, let's not put, you know, like, let's not...
1712280	1713280	I like...
1713280	1715280	He doesn't have to do more than that.
1715280	1716280	No, no.
1717280	1719280	My parents don't pick up...
1719280	1721280	Did you have more of a conversation after that?
1721280	1722280	No.
1723280	1727280	Well, because, you know, I put out a little Emmy, fantastic.
1728280	1729280	What am I supposed to be like?
1729280	1730280	How's the garden?
1730280	1731280	Yeah.
1731280	1735280	Why not use that as a way to open up a little dialogue between you...
1735280	1738280	It's only if you want the conversation to continue.
1738280	1740280	Yeah, I don't care about gardens.
1740280	1741280	Not Emmy worthy.
1742280	1743280	But what about...
1743280	1744280	Okay.
1744280	1745280	I thought that would get a laugh.
1748280	1749280	What?
1749280	1750280	Your dad opened up a dialogue.
1750280	1752280	He didn't open up a dialogue, I did.
1753280	1755280	But he furthered it.
1755280	1759280	He kicked that soccer ball back into play.
1759280	1762280	Oh, oh, oh, I see what you're saying.
1762280	1765280	So this would just continue forever.
1766280	1769280	Text your dad. Text your dad.
1769280	1772280	Oh, so fun to be part of an emotional epiphany.
1772280	1775280	Oh, Good Will Hunting. Text your dad.
1775280	1778280	Yay, we affected something.
1779280	1781280	Hey, dad, this happened.
1781280	1782280	Good.
1783280	1786280	Text him more. Text him more.
1787280	1788280	And forever?
1788280	1790280	Fuck people.
1792280	1793280	Give me an Emmy.
1794280	1795280	Don't applaud that.
1795280	1796280	Yeah.
1796280	1797280	Don't applaud that.
1797280	1798280	That is the bull.
1798280	1801280	Don't take people's instructions on when to applaud.
1801280	1802280	What did I tell you?
1803280	1804280	That is the bullshit.
1804280	1805280	Don't applaud that.
1807280	1809280	Well, okay, we'll talk.
1810280	1815280	Your father, who is as emotionally estranged as you are...
1815280	1816280	Emotionally estranged?
1816280	1817280	Yeah.
1821280	1823280	You can hold his hand if you want.
1823280	1824280	He was mocking you.
1824280	1826280	You said problematized.
1826280	1827280	My role changes.
1827280	1830280	When there are two, my role changes.
1830280	1831280	He speaketh.
1831280	1833280	I cosigneth.
1834280	1839280	But your dad said hip hip hooray and you said nothing.
1839280	1840280	That's the end of that?
1840280	1844280	No, well, his dad, a normal dad would say hip hip hooray.
1845280	1846280	Right.
1847280	1852280	But a cool ponytail dad said, fucking fantastic.
1852280	1854280	Read a cool theme.
1854280	1855280	Yeah, and so...
1855280	1857280	It's really surprising, you guys.
1857280	1859280	How are we trying to spin this into me continuing?
1860280	1861280	It's playing...
1862280	1863280	It's not gonna work.
1863280	1865280	It's playing catch with words, Dan.
1865280	1867280	This is what you've always wanted.
1867280	1869280	All right, okay, all right, all right.
1870280	1871280	How about this?
1871280	1873280	Well, every night of the week, I'll fucking text my dad.
1873280	1874280	Oh, wow.
1875280	1876280	Text him right now.
1877280	1880280	Tell him to see Mission Impossible Fallout.
1880280	1881280	It's supposed to be great.
1882280	1883280	Tell him to see Fallout.
1883280	1884280	It's supposed to be great.
1884280	1886280	Have you seen Mission...
1889280	1890280	Impossible...
1892280	1895280	Well, now, where does the colon go in a title like that?
1895280	1897280	Mission Impossible, am I right?
1897280	1898280	I think.
1898280	1899280	Yeah, you're right, yeah.
1899280	1902280	Mission, colon, impossible, semicolon, fallout.
1902280	1904280	Mission Impossible, colon, fallout.
1904280	1906280	Mission, the mission is impossible.
1906280	1908280	It's clearly Mission, colon, impossible.
1908280	1909280	Did they go...
1909280	1911280	The colon is baked into the original title.
1911280	1912280	Okay, all right.
1912280	1914280	Just tell your father you love him, Dan.
1916280	1918280	Tell your father you love him, Dan.
1919280	1920280	Tell him!
1925280	1927280	I prefer to go with a more possible mission.
1930280	1934280	Have you seen Mission, colon, impossible, colon, fallout?
1935280	1936280	This is...
1936280	1940280	A peach with ghost protocol, you know, as far as I'm concerned.
1940280	1942280	It's supposed to be really good.
1942280	1943280	I haven't seen it.
1943280	1945280	Well, he's going to ask why I'm asking.
1945280	1946280	That seems wrong.
1946280	1948280	That's because it's nice to hear from you, Dad.
1948280	1950280	I appreciate the...
1950280	1952280	Is that what you want me to text?
1952280	1953280	The connection.
1953280	1954280	It's nice to hear from you, Dad.
1954280	1955280	I appreciate the connection.
1955280	1956280	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
1956280	1960280	Can we, now that you have given him some information about yourself,
1960280	1962280	can we maybe ask him a question?
1962280	1963280	Ask him a question.
1963280	1964280	Thank you, Brandon.
1964280	1965280	What should I ask him?
1965280	1968280	You should ask him if you've seen Mission Impossible.
1968280	1970280	Have you seen Mission Impossible?
1970280	1975280	You should say, did you hear about these nuts in this Emmy nomination?
1975280	1976280	No, I already...
1976280	1977280	Come on, you're trying to trick me.
1977280	1978280	No, no, no, really.
1978280	1979280	Maybe you should say...
1979280	1981280	Maybe you should ask him what he's been up to.
1981280	1983280	What have you been up to?
1983280	1986280	Oh, yeah.
1986280	1987280	I miss you, Father.
1987280	1988280	What?
1989280	1993280	What have you been up to, question mark?
1993280	1996280	And that ends that segment.
1996280	1997280	Yeah.
1997280	2002280	Called everyone backseat drive my fucking relationship with my father.
2002280	2005280	In spite of me giving you complete fucking control over it,
2005280	2010280	you will never learn the lesson that the road leads nowhere.
2011280	2012280	I think it's fun.
2012280	2013280	Drive it off a cliff.
2013280	2014280	I don't fucking care.
2014280	2018280	Thelma and Louise my life, you pieces of shit.
2018280	2021280	Maybe love grows on trees where you live.
2021280	2022280	Don't fucking bully me.
2022280	2023280	All right, all right.
2023280	2025280	Everybody's a piece of shit.
2025280	2027280	I can turn off my fucking feelings like a light.
2027280	2028280	Oh, God.
2028280	2029280	Phil Collins.
2029280	2033280	I don't think two women driving a car off a cliff to commit suicide.
2033280	2034280	It's exactly the same.
2034280	2037280	It's the same as saying, hi, dad.
2037280	2038280	It is exactly the same.
2038280	2039280	It's not the same.
2039280	2043280	And don't you ever try to take that away from me or my gender?
2043280	2045280	Don't do it.
2045280	2046280	Here's something.
2046280	2049280	I haven't ever seen Long His Good Night,
2049280	2051280	and I just watched it recently.
2051280	2052280	Pretty good.
2052280	2054280	Let's do a scene from it.
2059280	2066280	The Long His Good Night.
2066280	2068280	Hey, what are you doing?
2068280	2070280	Hey, what are you doing?
2070280	2073280	Hey, hey, how'd you get it?
2073280	2075280	Hey, what are you doing?
2075280	2076280	Oh, God.
2076280	2077280	Oh, God.
2077280	2078280	Oh, God.
2078280	2079280	Oh, God.
2079280	2081280	Oh, yeah.
2081280	2084280	It flies backwards.
2084280	2087280	And out of the store.
2088280	2090280	That was a long kiss.
2090280	2091280	Good night.
2094280	2096280	I have to re-watch that movie.
2096280	2097280	It's pretty good.
2097280	2100280	I think it might be Dutch.
2100280	2107280	I don't remember that much Nosferatu in it.
2107280	2110280	Have you seen the Franklin Gella of Dracula?
2110280	2111280	Not for a long time.
2111280	2113280	Let's see a scene from that one.
2113280	2116280	Let's see a scene from Franklin Gella's Dracula.
2118280	2119280	Oh, man.
2119280	2122280	Oh, a wolf man.
2122280	2125280	A wolf man.
2127280	2129280	But you have to imagine the camera.
2129280	2134280	Twenty percent of the movie is a camera facing down the side of a building
2134280	2137280	with Franklin Gella moving his hands,
2137280	2140280	green screaming up the side of a building.
2140280	2142280	He's either coming for Renford.
2142280	2144280	He's coming for Lucy.
2144280	2146280	He's coming for free pretzels.
2146280	2147280	He'll Spider-Man.
2147280	2150280	That movie should have been called Spider-Man.
2150280	2152280	Renford.
2152280	2154280	Renford?
2154280	2156280	What's his name?
2162280	2163280	Hey!
2163280	2164280	Hey!
2164280	2166280	What are you doing crawling up my road there?
2166280	2167280	What are you doing?
2167280	2169280	Sanford, you will obey me.
2169280	2170280	Oh, no.
2170280	2172280	I'm Renford.
2172280	2173280	Oh, oh.
2173280	2174280	I'm going.
2174280	2175280	I'm going.
2175280	2177280	You have no faith, Sanford.
2177280	2178280	I'm going.
2178280	2179280	I'm going.
2179280	2181280	You eat a cockroach.
2181280	2184280	I'm eating a cockroach.
2184280	2189280	I expected you to be harder to command.
2189280	2191280	You are known for your fortitude.
2191280	2192280	I saw some lazy improv.
2192280	2193280	I just kind of go, eh.
2193280	2195280	Okay.
2195280	2197280	That was Renford and Sons.
2197280	2199280	Renford.
2199280	2200280	What do you like?
2200280	2204280	Do you like that shrapnel of just like, oh, this is Sanford.
2204280	2208280	I was trying to let them know there was a guy named Sanford once.
2208280	2210280	And you're like, oh, more like Renford.
2210280	2211280	Like, yeah.
2211280	2214280	Well, what do you think the name is of the Dracula's thrall?
2214280	2215280	Renfield.
2215280	2216280	Oh.
2216280	2217280	Oh, shit.
2217280	2219280	All right.
2219280	2220280	But you know what?
2220280	2222280	Dumb name.
2222280	2224280	Renford.
2224280	2225280	If I had a thrall.
2225280	2227280	Renford, the big red dog.
2227280	2232280	Was Renfield a vampire or what?
2232280	2234280	He wanted to become a vampire.
2234280	2238280	And in exchange for that, he agreed to eat cockroaches?
2238280	2241280	Why is it baked into his character that he has to eat cockroaches?
2241280	2244280	We've got three movies I could name where he eat cockroaches.
2244280	2246280	I think he's just like a mess.
2246280	2248280	Like, he was just kind of like slop.
2248280	2251280	It's just like Dracula sucks some of his blood.
2251280	2255280	Yeah, so like Brown Stoker clearly like said, like, oh, and he ate a roach.
2255280	2260280	And then every person that makes a movie is like, well, give the people what they want.
2260280	2262280	They want a fucking bat person.
2262280	2265280	They don't need no fucking Renfield eating roaches.
2265280	2266280	That's why they got Dracula.
2266280	2268280	It's not Renfield, the movie.
2268280	2271280	It's not Brown Stoker's Renfield.
2271280	2273280	Yeah, some Batman movies have Robin.
2273280	2274280	Some don't.
2274280	2275280	Sometimes they have Batgirl.
2275280	2276280	Sometimes they don't.
2276280	2277280	Like, sometimes they have a bat cave.
2277280	2278280	Sometimes they don't.
2278280	2280280	Every Dracula movie is like, oh, there's a Renfield.
2280280	2282280	And he's like, hmm, got to eat that roach.
2282280	2285280	Otherwise, you wouldn't know who I was.
2285280	2286280	And I'm like, why is he eating roaches?
2286280	2288280	Does he wish that they were people?
2289280	2291280	And was he a vampire?
2291280	2292280	Yeah.
2292280	2293280	But then he just...
2293280	2297280	Like, I'm telling you, it's a mess.
2297280	2298280	The movie's a mess.
2298280	2299280	The story's a mess.
2299280	2300280	They should change it.
2300280	2302280	Then they'd be famous.
2302280	2308280	I also feel like in a very nerdy sense, roaches are probably really cheap.
2308280	2309280	Well, yeah.
2309280	2310280	On set.
2310280	2311280	Oh, on set?
2311280	2312280	Yeah.
2312280	2317280	So they were like, you get spiders, rats, or you got these roaches for like eight for a
2317280	2318280	year.
2318280	2320780	And production was like, fucking, he's eating roaches.
2320780	2328120	You think that Bram Stoker described him eating a really expensive spider and he ate the most
2328120	2336280	delicious multi-hued peacock spider, a rare species from South America.
2336280	2340000	And then the first movie got made, and they were like, wow, isn't that really just a roach?
2340000	2344280	Like the line producers going, I don't know, I mean, these spiders are pretty expensive.
2345280	2350280	I mean, isn't a roach just a spider missing two legs or something?
2351280	2354280	And we can only afford to have this leg.
2354280	2356280	I went to a community college.
2356280	2359280	For me, most important building, the cafeteria.
2359280	2360280	Yeah.
2360280	2361280	Every scene should happen in there.
2361280	2362280	Yeah.
2363280	2367280	What's with all this Aben's apartment, Annie's apartment?
2367280	2368280	People got to eat.
2368280	2370280	Put them in a cafeteria.
2371280	2374280	It's half a sound stage.
2374280	2376280	It's already painted.
2379280	2384280	I know it's a spaceship, but could it be a cafeteria ship?
2385280	2390280	I don't want anybody inferring from that that Pat Kenlin, the line producer of Community,
2390280	2393280	was anything less than a wizard and a supportive ninja.
2393280	2398280	It just did become a running joke that when we were writing something, I'd be like, can
2398280	2400280	it be in the cafeteria?
2400280	2402280	Because he would ask that.
2402280	2407280	That was his job to ask that, but he wasn't stingy or unsupportive.
2407280	2410280	Sorry, I'm sensitive to people's legacies.
2410280	2412280	I'm ready to die.
2414280	2418280	I'd like to leave a fucking footprint without a turd in it.
2418280	2423280	Or enough of a turd that a footprint would be shaped like a middle finger.
2423280	2425280	Who stepped here?
2425280	2427280	Fuck you stepped here.
2429280	2431280	You sure did.
2431280	2434280	Where were they going? Your mother.
2434280	2436280	Why? To fuck you.
2436280	2438280	Her mother.
2438280	2439280	Yeah.
2439280	2441280	Why couldn't you say that?
2441280	2443280	I don't know, I'm getting confused.
2443280	2446280	Have you been drinking? Maybe. Fuck you.
2450280	2452280	Oh shit.
2453280	2456280	Sorry everybody.
2460280	2462280	No.
2463280	2466280	This bit went over pretty well last time.
2467280	2469280	MC Gun Control.
2469280	2471280	Thank you.
2471280	2473280	I don't have to change the t-shirt now.
2473280	2474280	Here.
2474280	2479280	I am a character that is a rapper.
2480280	2482280	I have a high voice.
2482280	2484280	Do we have a beat?
2488280	2490280	That's a good beat.
2490280	2491280	That's nice.
2491280	2493280	Is it very clear and distinct beat?
2493280	2495280	Yeah.
2495280	2499280	Opening titles for a David Fincher film.
2499280	2501280	Or a beat.
2503280	2505280	Yup.
2506280	2508280	Yeah, yeah.
2508280	2510280	That was a good call.
2510280	2512280	I'm here with my white friends.
2512280	2514280	Making a movie.
2514280	2519280	That just sounded like a David Fincher soundtrack.
2522280	2524280	MC Gun Control.
2524280	2526280	Oh this is nice.
2526280	2529280	I just wanted to explain my bit and then we can be done.
2529280	2531280	I didn't need to rap.
2531280	2533280	But that would be ridiculous.
2533280	2534280	If I did.
2534280	2535280	If I did.
2535280	2536280	Now I'm curious.
2536280	2537280	What if I did want to rap?
2537280	2539280	I just want to see.
2539280	2540280	Is that somebody's phone?
2540280	2542280	Oh this is excellent.
2543280	2544280	Is that?
2544280	2545280	Is that?
2545280	2547280	Turn the beat up a bit.
2547280	2549280	We're off.
2549280	2553280	Actually the path of least resistance would be to just turn it off.
2553280	2554280	It's.
2555280	2556280	Alright.
2556280	2557280	Well I can.
2557280	2558280	You know what I'll do.
2558280	2559280	Alright.
2560280	2561280	There you go.
2561280	2562280	Yeah.
2563280	2564280	Yeah.
2564280	2565280	Yeah.
2565280	2566280	Yeah.
2568280	2569280	Yeah.
2569280	2570280	Oh.
2570280	2571280	Okay.
2571280	2572280	Sarcastic.
2572280	2573280	Okay.
2573280	2574280	Yeah.
2574280	2575280	East.
2575280	2576280	West.
2577280	2580280	Your mama did it best.
2581280	2584280	Gun control.
2585280	2588280	It's how our country rolls.
2589280	2591280	Guns are dangerous.
2593280	2595280	Don't complain to this song.
2596280	2599280	Cause you can't pin me down for long.
2599280	2601280	I'll change sides.
2602280	2605280	My joke is you can't tell what I'm in favor of.
2606280	2609280	I fought your mama so hard I had to savor her.
2611280	2612280	Pussy.
2613280	2616280	I had to savor her pussy.
2617280	2618280	Yo.
2618280	2620280	I savored her pussy too.
2620280	2621280	Oh no.
2621280	2622280	MC.
2624280	2625280	Hold on.
2626280	2627280	You can say it.
2629280	2630280	Dad.
2632280	2633280	That's right.
2634280	2637280	I'm here to take you home MC gun control.
2638280	2639280	But.
2639280	2640280	But nothing.
2641280	2649280	The time of your ambiguity driven sketch character has come to a close.
2650280	2651280	No.
2652280	2653280	No.
2654280	2657280	Clarity is the new name of the game.
2657280	2661280	I fought your mama and you know that I knew her name.
2661280	2665280	I have the answers on MC gun controls dad.
2665280	2669280	I never fought you in between and fuck you good or bad.
2669280	2672280	There's always a clear answer.
2672280	2676280	I fought your mama and I am a tiny dancer.
2677280	2679280	The fuck are you doing?
2680280	2682280	I'm taking your phone.
2682280	2683280	Then I'm suing.
2684280	2685280	Take me to court.
2686280	2687280	I will.
2692280	2694280	The next day in court.
2697280	2699280	Hear ye, hear ye.
2699280	2701280	I'm MC judge.
2703280	2709280	I'm a third character that goes back and forth between the knob I'm turning.
2711280	2719280	All rise for me to have a judgment in the case of MC gun control versus his dad.
2721280	2722280	Thank you.
2723280	2724280	Your honor.
2725280	2726280	Yo.
2726280	2729280	I'd like to make the case against this motherfucker.
2729280	2733280	I'd like to talk about how he never raised me right.
2736280	2737280	I object.
2738280	2739280	Sustained.
2739280	2740280	Oh shit.
2740280	2741280	Sorry.
2741280	2742280	Sorry.
2742280	2743280	Sustained.
2744280	2747280	Well I already wanted to sustain it.
2748280	2750280	Okay well you're still not supposed to say it.
2750280	2751280	Fine.
2751280	2752280	Sustained.
2752280	2753280	Is that good?
2753280	2754280	For who?
2754280	2755280	Me.
2755280	2756280	No.
2757280	2760280	You mean I wanted to be, what's the other thing?
2760280	2761280	Overruled.
2761280	2762280	Is it overruled?
2762280	2763280	Yeah.
2763280	2764280	Good.
2764280	2766280	I'm being sarcastic.
2767280	2769280	I sustained it.
2769280	2771280	You sustained an ejection.
2772280	2773280	Yeah.
2773280	2777280	And that, you're telling me that's bad for me.
2778280	2780280	Look man, I'm just a judge.
2781280	2784280	My story goes back beyond the ages.
2784280	2785280	Hit it.
2790280	2791280	Yo.
2791280	2792280	Back beyond the ages.
2792280	2793280	Judge rap.
2793280	2794280	Yo.
2794280	2795280	Backstory judge rap.
2795280	2798280	Ask not what you can do for your country.
2800280	2803280	Ask what your country can do for you.
2803280	2804280	This is the back story.
2804280	2805280	I got it wrong.
2805280	2806280	I got it backwards.
2806280	2807280	To a judge.
2807280	2808280	You'll figure out what I meant.
2808280	2809280	Yo.
2809280	2810280	Mr. President.
2810280	2811280	I'm not a judge yet.
2811280	2813280	I'm still a lawyer but I gotta warn you.
2813280	2816280	I find you guilty of about to get shot.
2817280	2821280	Ask not why I would be shot but how I would be shot.
2821280	2822280	No.
2822280	2824280	He won't listen to me.
2824280	2825280	No.
2827280	2828280	Yo.
2828280	2830280	Nobody listen to me.
2830280	2832280	I'm just a back story judge.
2832280	2834280	Listen to my story.
2835280	2841280	I tried to warn JFK and he didn't listen to me and he got blown away.
2841280	2844280	Now I got a gavel in my hand.
2844280	2847280	I try to mete out justice all across the land.
2847280	2849280	I try to hammer it here.
2849280	2851280	Try to hammer it there.
2851280	2856280	I heard a case the other day about a woman versus her own hair.
2856280	2857280	Cut.
2857280	2859280	Cut to that cut to that case.
2859280	2861280	Otherwise that was a bad rhyme.
2863280	2864280	All right.
2864280	2865280	All right.
2865280	2866280	Fuck you guys.
2866280	2868280	You're like my, you're like my rare, rare poor, rare poor.
2868280	2869280	You know what?
2869280	2875280	I'm at the, my hair strangled me and I'm suing it for damages.
2875280	2876280	Ma'am.
2876280	2877280	To my throat.
2877280	2878280	Ma'am.
2878280	2879280	I'm a man.
2880280	2882280	I know you've been thinking I was a lady.
2882280	2885280	It's important to get this across.
2885280	2889280	But you know, you shouldn't represent yourself.
2889280	2891280	No, I know.
2891280	2893280	That's what my hair said.
2893280	2898280	I hope that, I hope that I try a case of true importance.
2898280	2900280	What would that be like?
2900280	2903280	Excuse me, Your Honor.
2904280	2906280	Yes?
2907280	2917280	I have apparently a rap for you about how I would like to sue my father.
2919280	2920280	Go on.
2921280	2922280	Yo.
2923280	2924280	What?
2925280	2926280	Yo.
2927280	2928280	Me?
2929280	2930280	No.
2931280	2932280	What?
2932280	2933280	Yo.
2934280	2935280	Huh?
2936280	2937280	Yo.
2938280	2939280	Okay.
2940280	2947280	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
2948280	2949280	Okay.
2949280	2950280	All right.
2950280	2951280	Well, listen.
2951280	2953280	Let me explain how the legal system works.
2953280	2954280	Wait.
2954280	2956280	If you want to sue somebody, you can just sue somebody.
2956280	2957280	It's not up to the judge.
2957280	2958280	I'm not like a barista.
2958280	2960280	You can't, it's not, I'm not, it's not like the genius bar.
2960280	2965280	Like you can't just catch me at the elevator and, and, and request a lawsuit.
2967280	2968280	No, it's not going to help.
2968280	2970280	Like that would be a terrible structured system.
2970280	2975280	You can't, that would mean that you had more recourse to justice than a normal person.
2975280	2977280	That would be really fucked up.
2978280	2980280	Say no more.
2981280	2983280	Here's a gun.
2985280	2986280	Uh-oh.
2986280	2987280	What do you mean?
2987280	2988280	Why are you giving me a gun?
2989280	2994280	Let's just say I may be for or against it.
2995280	2999280	But it would be a shame to let it out of control.
3000280	3001280	Beat.
3003280	3005280	Oh God, I'm going to die.
3006280	3007280	What do you mean beat?
3007280	3008280	What a terrible time for a beat.
3008280	3009280	What do you, don't point at him.
3009280	3010280	You said beat.
3010280	3011280	Beat.
3013280	3014280	No beat.
3014280	3015280	No.
3015280	3016280	What a terrible.
3016280	3017280	You just, you say it and then you say it again.
3017280	3021280	In a world where there's no wrong answers about when it's time for a rap.
3021280	3023280	That was a guy pulls out a gun.
3023280	3024280	Let's just say beat.
3024280	3026280	Oh, I'm going to get shot.
3026280	3028280	I don't know about it.
3029280	3030280	Beat.
3030280	3031280	All right.
3033280	3036280	Look, I mean, I'm just trying to fill time so that you guys can get home.
3036280	3037280	Hell yeah.
3037280	3038280	You're doing a great job.
3038280	3040280	Our soup is almost done.
3043280	3045280	Our cup soup is almost done.
3045280	3046280	What have you guys been up to this week?
3046280	3052280	Jeff, have you learned how to make that Mac of yours download the World Wide Web yet?
3052280	3053280	Yep.
3054280	3057280	I would do my vocal exercises and my voice is getting stronger every day.
3057280	3061280	What kind of, are you doing any dipthong and tripthong slurs?
3062280	3063280	Oh, shit.
3063280	3064280	You know what?
3064280	3065280	You know I am.
3065280	3066280	Oh, damn.
3066280	3068280	How do they differ?
3068280	3070280	I couldn't tell you.
3070280	3072280	Well, no, I mean, in number.
3072280	3073280	The tripthong is three.
3073280	3080280	I do a thing where I got a little piano app where I have to see where my vocal ceiling is every day.
3080280	3087280	So I start, I think I'm at B4.
3088280	3090280	And I have to sing that note every day.
3090280	3092280	And that's my ceiling.
3092280	3095280	And then you're done when you get to after.
3096280	3097280	Yeah.
3097280	3098280	It was Brandon's idea.
3098280	3099280	I saw his eyes.
3099280	3100280	Good job, DH.
3100280	3101280	Good job, DH.
3102280	3103280	Beat.
3106280	3107280	Look, I don't need to.
3108280	3111280	All I do, I show up, I try to entertain you people.
3111280	3112280	You're doing great.
3112280	3113280	No, I don't need that.
3113280	3114280	I'm not giving you it.
3114280	3117280	Dan, tell your new favorite joke, the cancer joke.
3117280	3120280	What's the difference between me and cancer?
3120280	3122280	That's your new favorite joke.
3122280	3123280	Cancer?
3123280	3124280	Yeah.
3125280	3126280	Cancer.
3127280	3129280	What's the difference between me and cancer?
3129280	3130280	Right.
3131280	3138280	I will go away for $50.
3141280	3142280	Beat.
3143280	3145280	We told this joke, Kevin.
3145280	3147280	I don't remember what it is.
3147280	3150280	What's the difference between me and cancer?
3150280	3152280	What's the difference between me and cancer?
3152280	3159280	If you get me, you have some support from your government.
3160280	3162280	I told you this joke a few days ago.
3162280	3163280	It was your favorite joke.
3163280	3164280	Okay.
3164280	3165280	Well, you're really...
3165280	3167280	What's the difference between me and cancer?
3167280	3168280	Dan's favorite joke.
3168280	3170280	What's the difference between me and cancer?
3170280	3172280	Clearly, you know that sometimes I'm drunk.
3172280	3174280	Spencer, what's the difference between me?
3174280	3177280	What's the difference between you and cancer?
3177280	3179280	My dad didn't beat cancer.
3180280	3181280	Yeah.
3182280	3183280	That is an incredible joke.
3183280	3185280	It's a fucking great joke.
3186280	3187280	That's fantastic.
3188280	3189280	Was that on stage?
3190280	3191280	Did we do that on stage?
3191280	3192280	No, we did it.
3192280	3193280	Me, you, and Dina were hanging out.
3193280	3194280	Yeah, that is funny.
3194280	3195280	What the fuck?
3195280	3196280	It's so dark.
3196280	3197280	It's so dark.
3197280	3198280	But it really is perfect.
3198280	3200280	You guys sure hang out a lot.
3204280	3206280	See you guys once a month.
3207280	3209280	From a jokes perspective, yeah.
3209280	3210280	Yeah, it is.
3210280	3212280	It's like, I like it.
3213280	3216280	It's like a little piece of origami that's not precious
3216280	3218280	but also isn't like hack.
3218280	3220280	I'm sitting at home.
3223280	3225280	Staring at the ceiling.
3225280	3228280	We're telling hilarious cancer jokes.
3228280	3231280	The only thing I have is my dog.
3233280	3234280	You're married.
3238280	3240280	She's playing magic cards with you, though.
3240280	3241280	Yeah, you should learn.
3241280	3242280	It's fun.
3242280	3243280	I hate games.
3243280	3245280	You have a dog and you're married.
3245280	3247280	I have a dog and I'm married.
3247280	3248280	Well...
3248280	3249280	Who needs friends?
3249280	3252280	I mean, what's the difference between your wife and the dog?
3252280	3255280	Your dog's not going to leave you when he hears...
3255280	3257280	That you have cancer.
3260280	3262280	I'm all alone and I have...
3262280	3264280	Oh my God.
3265280	3267280	We're just riffing up here.
3267280	3268280	It's a riff.
3269280	3270280	Huh?
3272280	3274280	What if your dog left when he found out you had cancer?
3274280	3276280	That'd be the fucking...
3276280	3278280	The shittiest dog in the world.
3278280	3279280	I told you this.
3279280	3280280	I didn't tell you.
3280280	3281280	Maybe I didn't.
3281280	3282280	I did tell you this.
3282280	3285280	Like on Kate's birthday, the cherry pie story.
3285280	3286280	No.
3288280	3290280	It's just an evocative dessert.
3290280	3291280	So many of the crowds out there.
3291280	3294280	That's a very self-satisfied baker back there.
3295280	3297280	So it's Kate's birthday and...
3298280	3302280	We get up in the morning, we go to the gym,
3302280	3304280	and my trainer goes,
3304280	3308280	today we're going to do push-ups until you can't anymore.
3308280	3311280	And I go, fuck!
3312280	3315280	And then I do it and I feel like shit.
3315280	3317280	I pay him and I leave and I walk outside.
3317280	3318280	It's hot.
3318280	3319280	It's awful.
3319280	3322280	And Kate goes, we need to go to Whole Foods
3322280	3325280	and we need to get some cherry pies for my birthday tonight.
3325280	3327280	And I'm like, I'm on it.
3327280	3328280	I'm on that.
3328280	3329280	I'm totally on it.
3329280	3331280	Feeling a little queasy.
3331280	3333280	Can we go home immediately after that?
3333280	3336280	I think I need to lie down after getting hurt.
3337280	3339280	And she goes, no problem.
3339280	3342280	So we get to groceries, put it on there.
3342280	3344280	I'm like, mmm, stomach's not feeling all that great.
3344280	3346280	And when you're in the car,
3346280	3348280	and the traffic's a little herky-jerky.
3348280	3349280	Stop starting.
3349280	3351280	And I go, try not to break so hard,
3351280	3353280	because I feel like I might...
3353280	3361280	And I puke all over the birthday pies.
3364280	3367280	And I look up at Kate, who's going...
3370280	3372280	Happy birthday to me.
3372280	3374280	You puked all over the birthday pies?
3374280	3375280	All over the birthday pies.
3375280	3377280	We got new pies.
3377280	3379280	We got new pies.
3379280	3381280	But I puke twice on it.
3381280	3383280	I'm like, I'm so sorry.
3383280	3385280	She's like, it's fine.
3385280	3387280	It was not fine.
3387280	3389280	It was awful.
3389280	3391280	Puked all over that.
3391280	3394280	And I don't know, something happened when I puked
3394280	3397280	that I hurt my shoulder.
3397280	3400280	I mean, like your body is doing a thing
3400280	3402280	that you never thought it would do.
3402280	3404280	So for the next couple of days,
3404280	3407280	I have a major pain in my shoulder.
3407280	3409280	And you have to remember that it's because you puked.
3409280	3412280	It was all over her birthday.
3412280	3417280	And so I go, oh, when I went back to get the cherry pies,
3417280	3420280	I bought some bengay to rub on my shoulder.
3420280	3422280	And I left it out in the car.
3422280	3424280	I'm going to go outside.
3424280	3426280	Lately, it's been a furnace outside.
3426280	3430280	It was like 122 degrees in the valley back then.
3430280	3434280	My car was outside, opened up the door, grabbed the bengay.
3434280	3435280	Ooh, it's hot.
3435280	3436280	Ooh, it's a hot tube.
3436280	3437280	I better put that...
3437280	3439280	Go back inside because it's so hot.
3439280	3440280	Oh, my gosh, it's really hot.
3440280	3442280	Ooh, thank God for AC.
3442280	3444280	Oh, this is going to feel good.
3444280	3446280	Haven't used bengay in a while.
3446280	3448280	How long?
3448280	3449280	A couple of decades.
3449280	3451280	Oh, shit.
3451280	3454280	I'm so proud of your generation that you weren't like,
3454280	3456280	maha, bengay, how long?
3456280	3457280	Oh.
3457280	3460280	That was like every time I see a tube of bengay,
3460280	3463280	I am forced to do this.
3463280	3465280	I've lived in Los Angeles for 20 years.
3465280	3466280	I have nothing but shame about this.
3466280	3470280	But I see the words and I go, bengay, how long?
3470280	3473280	And I am so proud of you tonight.
3473280	3476280	There are some things that just get solved over time.
3476280	3478280	Why is it called bengay?
3478280	3479280	Why?
3479280	3481280	Why is it called bengay?
3481280	3484280	Is there something in the words that say,
3484280	3486280	cream that you put on when it hurts?
3486280	3491280	Ben Hur said to his brother, bengay.
3491280	3493280	Let's switch.
3493280	3495280	What's the joke?
3495280	3497280	What's the joke?
3497280	3499280	It's red buttons.
3499280	3501280	What the fuck is the joke?
3501280	3502280	Wait, what?
3502280	3504280	I didn't know this joke.
3504280	3507280	Ben Hur, who said to his sister, bengay, let's switch.
3507280	3509280	What the fuck is the joke?
3509280	3511280	Never had a dinner.
3511280	3513280	Never had a dinner.
3513280	3517280	Ben Hur said to his sister, bengay, let's switch.
3517280	3519280	If we do, we'd be bengay.
3519280	3521280	Never had a dinner.
3522280	3524280	It's not funny.
3524280	3529280	We would literally go up to each other on the playground,
3529280	3531280	we would walk up to each other, and we would say,
3531280	3533280	say bengay.
3533280	3535280	That's all we would do.
3535280	3537280	We would say, say bengay.
3537280	3539280	And they would say, bengay.
3539280	3540280	And then we'd say, how long?
3540280	3542280	That's it.
3542280	3545280	That's how hard it was to be gay when I was a kid.
3545280	3547280	That's how little forgiveness you had.
3547280	3549280	And how easy it was to be phony.
3549280	3553280	Well, I want to know what happened with the hot bengay.
3553280	3555280	Okay, so run inside.
3555280	3557280	Oh, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot.
3557280	3559280	Kate's off doing something, running errands.
3559280	3561280	And the bengay's been in the car.
3561280	3563280	How long?
3563280	3565280	A couple days, a couple days.
3565280	3569280	Anyway, I go in there, I open up the thing,
3569280	3573280	and I squeeze it, and because of the heat buildup,
3573280	3575280	it goes, boom!
3575280	3577280	Splatters all over my head.
3577280	3581280	It's like Peter North, all over the place.
3583280	3585280	And I'm like, oh shit, waste not, want not,
3585280	3587280	better rub it in.
3587280	3589280	Waste not, want not.
3589280	3593280	This will probably make my shoulder feel better, quicker.
3593280	3595280	And I'm rubbing it in the hand, I'm rubbing it in the hand.
3595280	3599280	Did you rub it on your face?
3599280	3601280	Look, yes.
3601280	3605280	I forgot that bengay heats up after a while.
3605280	3607280	Okay, all right.
3607280	3611280	Isn't that a bit in Revenge of the Nerds or something?
3611280	3615280	But I wanted to pause the commentary here,
3615280	3617280	because I wanted to say,
3617280	3621280	I thought it was going to be hot, because it was in the car.
3621280	3623280	It was.
3623280	3625280	But it was hot, and it was pow.
3625280	3630280	It was just a little, and I just exploded.
3630280	3633280	It hit you, and you're like, oh, hotter than regular,
3633280	3635280	hotter than first contact with bengay.
3635280	3637280	Mostly it was like volume.
3637280	3639280	It was like, wow, that's a lot.
3639280	3641280	It's like a lot of bengay.
3641280	3643280	And I just like rub it in.
3643280	3647280	And I forget that after a while, it heats up.
3647280	3651280	And somewhere between pop and it heating up,
3651280	3655280	which I'm thinking is like about two minutes,
3655280	3657280	I touched mine.
3657280	3659280	It's called the refractory period.
3659280	3661280	The what?
3661280	3663280	It's called the refractory period.
3663280	3665280	Don't make me repeat it.
3665280	3667280	I was ashamed of it the first time.
3667280	3670280	During the refractory period,
3670280	3674280	I must have touched my shoulder,
3674280	3679280	my face, my neck, my balls, my dick,
3679280	3682280	my asshole, my knees, or whatever.
3682280	3686280	And there's just a roadmap of what I did to myself
3686280	3689280	to get rid of all of this bengay.
3689280	3693280	And I start going, ooh, ooh, ah.
3693280	3695280	That's a little uncomfortable.
3695280	3697280	I hope that doesn't get any worse.
3697280	3700280	Oh, oh, okay, okay, getting real.
3700280	3701280	That's got to be it.
3701280	3703280	No, no, coming more.
3703280	3704280	Holy shit.
3704280	3706280	Oh, my God.
3706280	3709280	Rolling on the floor, scream crying.
3709280	3713280	I'm in the living room floor going, ah, oh, my God.
3713280	3715280	Help me, help me.
3715280	3719280	And I look up, and I see my dog on the couch
3719280	3721280	looking down at me, giving me the same look
3721280	3724280	the Kate gave me when I threw up on her cherry pie.
3724280	3726280	Just...
3728280	3730280	You've really...
3730280	3733280	This is what I signed up for.
3733280	3736280	I'm going, ah, you don't understand.
3736280	3739280	Lolly, it hurts so much.
3739280	3742280	Danny made a bad mistake.
3742280	3744280	Oh, he forgot it burned.
3744280	3746280	The dog is like, you have the power
3746280	3748280	to open and close the door?
3748280	3750280	Yeah.
3754280	3756280	You...
3756280	3760280	He who opens cans, this is what you're vulnerable to?
3760280	3761280	I know.
3761280	3765280	A tube of something smaller than a cat?
3765280	3767280	How did you get from an explosion of bengay
3767280	3768280	down to your balls?
3768280	3770280	Why did that become a thing?
3770280	3771280	I don't know.
3771280	3772280	I just...
3772280	3775280	Well, it had been three minutes.
3777280	3778280	And he was alone.
3778280	3779280	And Kate was...
3779280	3780280	What do you think he was going to touch?
3780280	3781280	An atlas?
3781280	3782280	Yeah.
3784280	3785280	Very true.
3785280	3787280	The world's been explored.
3787280	3788280	Yeah.
3789280	3791280	I made pickled eggs one time
3791280	3793280	when I cut up some habanero peppers,
3793280	3795280	and I was making the best pickled eggs of all time.
3795280	3798280	I hope this has nothing to do with editing.
3798280	3801280	And then an hour or two later,
3801280	3804280	I masturbated, but I had forgotten
3804280	3807280	to not wash my hands a million times.
3807280	3810280	And my dick was on fire for a week.
3812280	3813280	I've masturbated.
3813280	3814280	It's not a fucking alert.
3814280	3817280	Like, you cannot cut a habanero pepper
3817280	3819280	and then touch anything forever
3819280	3821280	for the rest of your life.
3821280	3823280	When I was like 15,
3823280	3824280	and I'm...
3824280	3826280	So I'm talking fucking...
3826280	3829280	Welcome back to PPS Jerkit Stories.
3830280	3832280	It's your tax dollars at work.
3832280	3835280	Like, I've talked on this show about how when I was like 11...
3835280	3837280	When I hit 11, there was no turning back.
3837280	3839280	It was Inspector Gadget and fucking...
3839280	3840280	You were going to keep on aging.
3840280	3841280	Yeah.
3843280	3846280	So when I'm 15 years old,
3846280	3847280	and it's just...
3847280	3849280	There's no stopping.
3849280	3853280	It's just a round-the-clock fucking union job,
3853280	3854280	like jerking off.
3855280	3861280	And I would literally go in my own house's basement.
3861280	3863280	I'm 15, so I live with my parents.
3863280	3866280	I'm doing so much that I'm just pretending
3866280	3868280	I have a reason to be in the basement,
3868280	3870280	which is so mythical.
3872280	3875280	That meant that I had jerked off so much
3875280	3878280	that everyone knew that's all I did in my room.
3878280	3880280	And that I was like, I'm going to change a fuse?
3880280	3881280	What was I...
3881280	3883280	I had so much jerking off to do.
3883280	3888280	And I just remember it chafing
3888280	3892280	and then trying to employ a product,
3892280	3895280	because I had seen in the movies or heard in popular culture
3895280	3897280	the lotions and the things.
3897280	3900280	And I remember trying to use some product.
3900280	3902280	I don't remember what it was.
3902280	3905280	It wasn't anything comedically harmful,
3905280	3908280	like Ben Gay or Mentholyptus.
3908280	3910280	Like, oh, it burns or anything like that.
3910280	3913280	But it also was not idealized for...
3913280	3914280	What?
3914280	3915280	What'd you say?
3915280	3916280	How long?
3916280	3917280	Oh.
3917280	3918280	I thought you were...
3918280	3920280	But all I remember...
3922280	3925280	All I remember is the result,
3925280	3928280	which is that after going to town forever,
3931280	3935280	who knows why I stopped long enough to notice anything?
3935280	3938280	Maybe there was a solstice, I don't know.
3938280	3942280	But I remember looking at my little penis
3942280	3944280	and being like, oh!
3944280	3948280	I had to go to my parents.
3948280	3950280	I didn't have to, I did.
3950280	3952280	This is how alarmed I was.
3952280	3955280	And I was like, I didn't show them,
3955280	3958280	but I was like, I think I fucked up.
3960280	3962280	What were they doing?
3962280	3963280	What were they doing?
3963280	3965280	Was your dad building stained glass?
3965280	3968280	Watching blazing saddles and my mom was knitting, I don't know.
3968280	3973280	And I'm like, guys, I need to ask a question about
3975280	3978280	what it's possible to do to your penis
3978280	3981280	if you do nothing but...
3982280	3985280	Remember, because I was like, I am alarmed.
3985280	3989280	It looks, when I say shriveled,
3990280	3995280	I want you to understand that it is a pre-shriveled penis.
4000280	4003280	I remember being scared that it had this,
4003280	4007280	it was chafed,
4007280	4009280	or there was something wrong.
4009280	4011280	I was like, God, I broke my dick.
4011280	4013280	I can't remember what it was.
4013280	4016280	To me at the time, I was like, oh, God, I made my dick.
4017280	4020280	If Game of Thrones was on at the time,
4020280	4024280	I would have been like, oh, God, I turned my dick into the stone disease.
4026280	4030280	It had scales.
4030280	4032280	And I was like, what have I done?
4032280	4036280	Is that just a thing that happens when you use the wrong product on your dick?
4036280	4037280	Of course it does.
4037280	4038280	What was I thinking?
4038280	4040280	Why would I just put anything on my dick?
4040280	4044280	And the answer is, shoot first, ask questions later.
4045280	4048280	You're not thinking.
4048280	4051280	It's not a heist.
4051280	4053280	You don't roll out a blueprint and be like,
4053280	4056280	here's how we're going to do it for the maximum results.
4056280	4059280	By the time you're going through a closet,
4059280	4061280	you're like a fucking desperate man.
4061280	4063280	Shoot first.
4063280	4065280	What was the...
4065280	4066280	Cure?
4066280	4068280	No, let's go slow.
4069280	4072280	How did you establish contact?
4073280	4077280	All I remember is because I think I blocked a lot of it out
4077280	4080280	because it's just so humiliating to think about.
4080280	4085280	But I remember I know the fact that I did because I was so concerned
4085280	4088280	because I was like, well, this might be a thing that
4088280	4091280	you don't want the story 20 years from now to be
4091280	4095280	and then I didn't say anything and then my dick dissolved.
4097280	4101280	In my head, the only thing more powerful than my horniness
4101280	4104280	and later I would find out, you can't do anything to a dick,
4104280	4105280	to kill it.
4105280	4106280	We wish.
4106280	4108280	I just wish I had known that.
4108280	4109280	I thought it was a unicorn.
4109280	4112280	I'm like, hey, friend, what can I do to keep you alive?
4113280	4114280	You can't fucking...
4114280	4118280	You can put one of these things in a pair of pliers.
4118280	4119280	It doesn't...
4119280	4123280	Yeah, that's the thing that nature's going to make frail.
4125280	4128280	All right, I hit a nerve.
4129280	4132280	But I was like, I was like, I'm worried about it
4132280	4135280	and I broached the subject with my mom.
4135280	4137280	I think my dad too.
4138280	4141280	And it was like, I think I broke my dick.
4142280	4143280	How do you know?
4143280	4145280	Is there such a thing as like, here's what I used.
4145280	4147280	I can't remember what it was.
4147280	4151280	And they were just like, ugh, like so bummed out.
4152280	4153280	They weren't really...
4153280	4156280	I want to say they weren't of any help
4156280	4158280	because they were probably like,
4158280	4160280	well, do you want to go to a hospital or not?
4160280	4162280	Don't tell us about that shit.
4163280	4164280	Does it hurt?
4164280	4165280	No.
4165280	4166280	It looks weird.
4166280	4168280	Weirder than a dick?
4170280	4171280	Yeah.
4172280	4173280	That's why I'm asking.
4173280	4174280	Mine's 15 years old.
4174280	4175280	Does it ever...
4176280	4178280	It looks like the following?
4179280	4181280	Because I used this?
4182280	4184280	After a while, I think the message I'm getting
4184280	4186280	is I wait for it to heal.
4186280	4187280	Fuck you, people.
4188280	4189280	What was the product?
4189280	4190280	What did you use?
4190280	4191280	I can't remember.
4191280	4194280	I was probably like some kind of like really specific lotion
4194280	4196280	that I was just like, well, all lotions are the same
4196280	4199280	but it was like, maybe it was like a lotion for monkeys
4199280	4200280	or something.
4200280	4201280	I don't know.
4202280	4203280	I just remember...
4203280	4205280	Turtle wax.
4207280	4210280	It really sticks out in my head that I was in the basement
4210280	4212280	using it, that I was like, I had gotten to the point
4212280	4213280	where I was like...
4214280	4216280	Because I see like intervention episodes where like
4216280	4219280	the grown man will just like, they won't even explain it
4219280	4222280	but he'll just have like a little corner in the basement
4222280	4224280	where he lights his crack pipe, you know?
4224280	4227280	It's just like it's become, you know?
4227280	4229280	And I feel like it's just like, God damn.
4229280	4231280	You know, this guy likes jerking off.
4232280	4236280	You're lucky that you have a black mom
4236280	4239280	who really coveted her hair care products.
4242280	4244280	Because that was a choice that I had to make
4244280	4246280	under great duress.
4246280	4248280	Did that go south?
4248280	4250280	That went south because you know they become sleuths
4250280	4251280	about the shit.
4251280	4253280	You try to be like, I was in the shower
4253280	4257280	and I was taking a shower and I got some shampoo in my dick
4257280	4259280	and she's not gonna buy that shit.
4259280	4260280	You got it in...
4260280	4262280	Wait, are you saying you got it in it?
4262280	4263280	Right.
4263280	4266280	It's exactly what she said holding a Virginia Slims.
4266280	4270280	She's like, you got it in your dick somehow.
4271280	4273280	Okay, Brandon.
4275280	4276280	So now you have to make a choice.
4276280	4278280	Do you want to fuck with Matlock?
4278280	4280280	Oh, super sleuth bitch.
4280280	4282280	Or do you want to get some help?
4282280	4283280	Do you want your dick to fall off
4283280	4286280	or do you want to become a bitch in front of your mom
4286280	4288280	who is ready for that shit?
4288280	4289280	I like that shit, yeah.
4289280	4292280	And she knows it's indestructible.
4292280	4293280	It's not her first dick.
4293280	4296280	Like, she's like, I give two shits
4296280	4299280	whether my teenage son's dick stings for a second.
4299280	4300280	You used to make shampoo.
4300280	4301280	Right.
4301280	4303280	I'm gonna shame you out of using my good shit.
4303280	4306280	Now, how did it get in the tip of your dick?
4306280	4307280	I'll answer that.
4307280	4308280	You stole it.
4308280	4309280	Right.
4310280	4313280	I'll keep your dick out of my shampoo.
4314280	4316280	I'm gonna help you in ways you didn't predict.
4316280	4317280	Do girls do that?
4317280	4319280	Is that a thing where you experiment with awful shit
4319280	4322280	that burns your pussy up?
4323280	4324280	Pineapple?
4324280	4325280	Anybody?
4325280	4326280	No.
4326280	4327280	Marietta cats?
4327280	4328280	No.
4328280	4331280	I don't think women need lubrication the same way.
4331280	4332280	I mean, you always need lubrication.
4332280	4333280	Don't get me wrong.
4333280	4334280	But, like...
4335280	4336280	Don't get me wrong.
4336280	4337280	It's...
4337280	4339280	I don't think guys generate their own.
4340280	4341280	You know?
4341280	4342280	Well, I also don't think I need...
4342280	4343280	I mean, I...
4343280	4344280	Look, I don't...
4344280	4347280	Well, look, now we're getting into current events.
4347280	4348280	Yeah.
4348280	4349280	I don't use...
4349280	4353280	I don't use any soap.
4353280	4354280	That's bullshit.
4354280	4355280	Don't do that.
4355280	4359280	I only use Brandon's mom's hair products now.
4364280	4366280	Because fucking it's top of the line, man.
4366280	4368280	It's top of the line, really.
4368280	4369280	It's collagen-enriched.
4373280	4375280	Should we get Levy up here and find out what he uses?
4376280	4377280	Yeah!
4377280	4380280	See, Levy is a Levy man.
4381280	4383280	Is a Levy in the house?
4384280	4386280	You know, when was another segue gonna happen?
4390280	4391280	What's happening, guys?
4391280	4392280	What up?
4392280	4393280	What up, questions?
4393280	4395280	Have you asked your parents about your dick?
4395280	4398280	What do you put on your dick?
4399280	4401280	What do you put on your dick?
4401280	4404280	What do you put on your dick?
4405280	4406280	Oh, boy.
4406280	4407280	This is a loaded question.
4407280	4409280	Is that the question you want me to answer?
4409280	4410280	I can't say it.
4410280	4412280	What weird product did you put on your dick
4412280	4414280	as a child that, for a moment, made you think
4414280	4416280	you might have lost your dick?
4416280	4418280	I got a good one.
4418280	4419280	Silly putty?
4419280	4420280	Oh.
4420280	4421280	Hell yeah.
4422280	4424280	How do you know when you're finished?
4424280	4426280	I'm the only one that volunteered information
4426280	4428280	and got totally made fun of for it.
4428280	4429280	Thank you for leaving me.
4429280	4430280	For real, silly putty?
4430280	4431280	So, okay, here.
4431280	4435280	I mean, I had to be three or four years old.
4435280	4436280	I thought you were gonna say,
4436280	4438280	I had to be at a board meeting at three...
4439280	4440280	Yeah.
4440280	4441280	Four silly putty.
4441280	4444280	We were meeting at Warner Brothers three months ago.
4444280	4446280	I had no time to fuck around.
4446280	4448280	Did you think, because you saw the commercial
4448280	4451280	and you see how silly putty you put it on like a comic book
4451280	4453280	and you smear it on it and you could peel it up
4453280	4455280	and you could see the, like, Batman on it?
4455280	4456280	Yeah, I got bored of that, I guess.
4456280	4459280	So you think you're gonna put it on your dick
4459280	4461280	and then you could see your dick in the putty?
4461280	4463280	They could make his dick really big.
4463280	4465280	He sculpted a vagina.
4465280	4467280	Like a real psychopath.
4467280	4469280	I was just experimenting as a kid, I guess.
4469280	4470280	I don't know.
4470280	4472280	I took it out of its little red shell.
4472280	4473280	It's so horny.
4473280	4475280	My mom was working or whatever.
4475280	4478280	And then I just mushed it on my dick.
4478280	4480280	My mom was working or whatever.
4480280	4481280	I don't know.
4481280	4483280	I just remember, like, you know, because...
4483280	4484280	Way to shame her.
4484280	4485280	It was...
4485280	4487280	I know, and it is funny.
4487280	4490280	You have to admit that there's still an adult impulse to, like...
4490280	4491280	I don't know.
4491280	4493280	Look, there was no supervision.
4493280	4494280	Right.
4494280	4495280	Exactly.
4495280	4498280	Well, she was, like, in the other room, working,
4498280	4499280	and I, like...
4499280	4502280	I just mashed some silly putty on my dick,
4502280	4504280	but I made sure it was, like, totally covered.
4504280	4505280	Like, I was, like, in a shell.
4505280	4506280	Like, twirly.
4506280	4507280	Hell, yeah.
4507280	4508280	You did this motion.
4508280	4509280	Yeah, yeah.
4509280	4510280	That's the motion I was doing.
4510280	4511280	Yeah, yeah.
4511280	4513280	Like, you made, like, a string, like, a silly putty.
4513280	4514280	No, you just, like, mushed it.
4514280	4515280	You just, like, mushed it all around.
4515280	4516280	Oh, you were being sarcastic.
4516280	4517280	Yeah, yeah.
4520280	4521280	It seemed pretty...
4522280	4525280	So then I just left it on.
4525280	4526280	Oh, no.
4526280	4527280	And then I went about my day.
4527280	4529280	If it ain't broke...
4529280	4531280	I just, like, didn't think about it, and I was like,
4531280	4533280	all right, and then I moved on to the next activity.
4534280	4536280	What was your day?
4537280	4538280	Oh, right?
4538280	4539280	He left it on, because he's like,
4539280	4542280	well, this actually alleviates the pain from a slinky.
4542280	4543280	Yeah.
4543280	4544280	Yeah.
4544280	4547280	So you got a dick-covered silly putty, and you said,
4547280	4550280	okay, you know, I got meetings, I got shit to do.
4550280	4551280	I got Super Nintendos.
4551280	4552280	I got action figures.
4552280	4553280	I got pasty.
4553280	4554280	I got Nickelodeon.
4554280	4555280	I can't be...
4555280	4556280	It was a full schedule.
4556280	4559280	I can't be wishing my time taking silly putty off of my dick.
4559280	4560280	Yeah.
4560280	4561280	Yeah.
4561280	4565280	It's like, you know, like, the gun at the beginning of a movie
4565280	4568280	that you're going to reveal the...
4568280	4570280	What, like, did you, like, go about your day,
4570280	4573280	and then you all of a sudden, like, made a bet with somebody?
4573280	4574280	I bet my dick's weird.
4574280	4575280	So, no, I just...
4575280	4576280	It was there for hours.
4576280	4577280	My mom took me out for, like, errands.
4577280	4579280	I was, like, in my car seat, driving around.
4579280	4581280	I remember we were doing all this stuff, and we got back,
4581280	4583280	and it's, like, bath time.
4587280	4588280	And so...
4588280	4590280	So we can call this Act Two.
4591280	4592280	Yeah.
4592280	4593280	Maybe Act Three?
4593280	4594280	Where are we at right now?
4594280	4595280	Yeah, if we're...
4595280	4596280	Meeting with the goddess.
4596280	4599280	No, the meeting with the goddess is...
4599280	4600280	Yeah, I don't know.
4600280	4602280	Having a good time during the day with silly putty.
4602280	4603280	Like, the best time.
4603280	4604280	The silly putty on my dick.
4604280	4606280	The atonement is...
4606280	4609280	We come back from fucking...
4609280	4612280	Fun time junction, and...
4612280	4613280	Bath time junction.
4613280	4614280	Bath time junction.
4614280	4615280	And then my...
4615280	4616280	And your mom's like,
4616280	4617280	We had the best day today.
4617280	4618280	We did a lot.
4618280	4619280	We had a lot done.
4619280	4621280	Mom, I want you to understand.
4621280	4622280	Yeah.
4622280	4624280	Can I tell you a secret?
4624280	4625280	Sorry, go ahead.
4625280	4626280	Go ahead.
4626280	4629280	So, you know, obviously, like, you get undressed.
4629280	4631280	She's like, Jesus Christ, what the...
4631280	4632280	Wait.
4632280	4633280	Wait.
4633280	4635280	Why does your dick have Archie on it?
4635280	4636280	Do it.
4636280	4637280	Yeah.
4637280	4638280	Yeah.
4638280	4639280	Yeah.
4639280	4643280	Um, and by that time, it had totally dried.
4643280	4644280	So, it couldn't...
4644280	4645280	You can't...
4645280	4646280	You couldn't get it off.
4646280	4648280	That's your deal breaker, everybody.
4648280	4650280	You couldn't get it off that easy.
4650280	4653280	So, I just remember, like, we had...
4653280	4656280	Like, I soaked in the tub for a while, and then...
4656280	4658280	Wait, now your mom's...
4658280	4659280	Yeah.
4659280	4660280	On board, and she's like,
4660280	4661280	Well, we were gonna check her bath.
4661280	4662280	We gotta check her bath.
4662280	4663280	We gotta get it off.
4663280	4664280	Right.
4664280	4665280	What did you tell her?
4665280	4667280	Did you say, I don't know how that happened, though?
4667280	4668280	I was so...
4668280	4669280	Honestly, I have no recollection.
4669280	4670280	I was so young.
4670280	4671280	You were...
4671280	4672280	You were working.
4672280	4673280	You heard him.
4673280	4674280	He threw her under the bus.
4674280	4675280	I was so young.
4675280	4677280	Fucking shout out to moms.
4677280	4678280	Goddamn.
4678280	4679280	Oh, yeah.
4679280	4681280	We would not have our dicks without them.
4681280	4682280	Huh?
4682280	4683280	Huh?
4683280	4684280	Huh?
4684280	4685280	That's...
4685280	4689280	The modern version of that is every mom I've talked to that's found their kid on the laptop.
4689280	4693280	Like, same age, but they're just, like, typing in the craziest, like,
4693280	4694280	Oh, you...
4694280	4696280	That's how you think vagina is spelled.
4696280	4702280	Like, four years old just trying to figure shit out and, like, getting rewarded by this,
4702280	4703280	like, fucking, stupid spell.
4703280	4707280	So you put the silly putty on your dick, and you left it on there,
4707280	4709280	and it congealed and hardened.
4709280	4710280	Yeah, yeah.
4710280	4713280	And then your mom had to fucking go to work and fucking get it off your dick?
4713280	4714280	Yeah, yeah.
4714280	4715280	It was...
4715280	4716280	It was like a...
4716280	4717280	It was like a...
4718280	4719280	Yeah.
4722280	4723280	I know.
4723280	4726280	A silly putty can dry, and then it turns into, like, clay?
4726280	4728280	That's as much as I remember, yeah.
4728280	4729280	It was like a cast.
4729280	4730280	Like, did she...
4730280	4731280	You know what signed it?
4731280	4732280	I don't know.
4733280	4736280	I remember being pretty upset and confused.
4736280	4740280	Because she probably let it slip a little bit that she was a little put off.
4741280	4743280	Like, you didn't want your mom to be upset?
4743280	4744280	Yeah.
4744280	4745280	I mean, I was in trouble.
4745280	4746280	I don't think I grasped...
4746280	4748280	She wasn't like, yay for experimenting.
4748280	4751280	She was like, overall, what the fuck?
4751280	4754280	And then you're like, that's not a good thing for a mom to feel,
4754280	4755280	so then you felt bad.
4755280	4758280	Throughout the day, do you remember if at any time during the day...
4758280	4759280	I was so young, but...
4759280	4760280	Yeah.
4760280	4763280	I was just curious, like, if you remember that at any time during the day,
4763280	4765280	you were like, eh, this is gonna...
4765280	4766280	You know, like, where you...
4766280	4768280	Did you just forget it entirely?
4768280	4769280	No, I mean, you could...
4770280	4776280	I remember being in the car, in my car seat, clocking like,
4776280	4778280	this is uncomfortable.
4778280	4780280	Because I have vague memories of shitting my pants,
4780280	4783280	and then you just, like, hang out and wait to get busted.
4783280	4784280	I have so many...
4784280	4785280	Yeah.
4785280	4787280	Like, I feel like you just wait and then people start smelling
4787280	4788280	and you're like, goddamn it.
4788280	4791280	You know, but you still feel like maybe there's some version.
4791280	4794280	I'd like to know what my four-year-old self thought.
4794280	4795280	Like, man, I don't know.
4795280	4797280	Maybe, like, giraffes will start attacking her.
4797280	4799280	I mean, I guess I was a strange kid.
4799280	4803280	I also remember this time where my dad had cut down this tree in my backyard.
4803280	4805280	Again, I was living on Long Island, so this is like...
4805280	4807280	I was so young.
4807280	4811280	And I just felt like, man, that looks like a really great place to take a shit.
4811280	4816280	Just on this cleanly cut, like, stump of a tree.
4816280	4819280	And my parents were inside, and I was outside,
4819280	4822280	and I just fucking dropped trowel and took a shit on the stump of the tree.
4822280	4823280	Wow.
4823280	4825280	And I was like, all right, well, that was interesting.
4825280	4828280	And then I was like, well, I got to go to the bathroom now,
4828280	4829280	because I got to wipe.
4829280	4831280	And so I went inside, I wiped.
4831280	4837280	And then, like, I remember, like, an hour later, my dad, like...
4837280	4839280	He went outside to do some gardening or something.
4839280	4843280	He was like, did you...?
4843280	4845280	He was hoping the answer was no.
4845280	4850280	He was like, I want the answer to be no, because I'm going to call Bob Saget.
4850280	4853280	Well, no, I mean, I was like, no, no.
4853280	4856280	Obviously, I was like, no, I didn't do that.
4856280	4858280	And he was like, no, you fuck it.
4858280	4859280	Come on.
4859280	4862280	That's human shit on a fucking tree stump.
4862280	4864280	He let it slide, but he was just like, I'm not an idiot.
4864280	4869280	Son, you did it or we have to move.
4869280	4871280	Think about your choices here.
4871280	4873280	He didn't shame me.
4873280	4875280	He didn't shame me for doing it.
4875280	4876280	It's such a shame.
4876280	4879280	I never got to fucking talk to him about this stuff.
4879280	4881280	It's you or it's Jean.
4882280	4884280	I kept that inside my whole life.
4884280	4885280	I never talked to anybody about it.
4885280	4888280	I don't know if my mom remembers that, but if my dad were still alive,
4888280	4891280	it's definitely one of the things I would be like, do you remember when that...
4891280	4894280	That was me.
4894280	4896280	I love that it was a clean...
4896280	4901280	Because I'm picturing a really sawdust and pure...
4901280	4906280	In my mind, I see it as perfectly sanded and lacquered or whatever.
4906280	4907280	With a little bit of dust though, right?
4907280	4910280	Because there's a little bit of cat or dog in you that was like...
4910280	4912280	Plus it's a little bit of...
4912280	4916280	We're cousins of other mammals, so there's a common link there.
4916280	4919280	I bet a cat would feel the same thing.
4919280	4922280	There was some excited exhibitionism going through my mind.
4922280	4928280	I also love, Levi, that if you could have another conversation with your departed father,
4928280	4930280	it would be that way.
4930280	4931280	Like you wouldn't look at you and be like,
4931280	4935280	motherfucker, you brought me back from the dead to talk about shit stories?
4935280	4937280	He would find it fitting, I think.
4937280	4940280	Do you think anybody saw...
4940280	4946280	I remember the excitement being like, I'm going to be naked outside for a second.
4946280	4947280	I'm really nervous about it.
4947280	4951280	My yard is fenced in, but the neighbors and like, could they see through?
4951280	4953280	I was like, I don't want anyone to see this.
4953280	4955280	I don't remember thinking that.
4955280	4957280	And then I still went through with it.
4957280	4958280	I don't know.
4958280	4962280	That's like the most adventurous I had been until I was probably in my 20s.
4962280	4965280	Until tonight.
4965280	4968280	Bring out the stump.
4968280	4971280	Tonight, we've got a stump in studio.
4971280	4974280	I can really picture that.
4974280	4980280	I really want to share my sympathies because I can really picture this stump.
4980280	4981280	It's got even a target.
4981280	4983280	It's like kind of blonde wood.
4983280	4988280	I'm picturing like a dark bark, but like a rich yellow wood.
4988280	4989280	A white oak.
4989280	4990280	Yeah, it was very...
4991280	4996280	I've never wanted to shit anywhere except the toilet or my pants when I was a kid.
4996280	5000280	Me too, except for that one time in my life.
5000280	5001280	And I did it.
5001280	5002280	I never did it again.
5002280	5003280	I'm proud of you.
5003280	5004280	Thank you.
5004280	5006280	Did you make it right in the center?
5006280	5008280	Did it look like a clean...
5008280	5013280	I wanted to look like a Hershey's Kiss in the middle of this giant thing.
5013280	5016280	You know that you go to a redwood forest and they point at the rings and they go,
5016280	5020280	Napoleon invades...
5020280	5022280	Storm's the best deal.
5022280	5026280	The Wright brothers fly their plane at Kitty Hawk with the rings of the tree
5026280	5028280	and then in the center of it, Stephen Levy takes a shit.
5028280	5031280	But that's not right because that would be the oldest thing.
5031280	5033280	I honestly don't know.
5033280	5035280	And they have to explain that in the placard.
5035280	5039280	They're like, sorry, then Steve Levy took a shit, but not in the stone age.
5039280	5045280	So your dad goes, hey, Stephen, did you take a shit on the tree stump
5045280	5049280	and you were like, huh?
5049280	5050280	Stacking block.
5050280	5051280	Hold on, dad.
5051280	5052280	Hold on.
5052280	5053280	And C.
5053280	5054280	What?
5054280	5056280	What?
5056280	5059280	Did you take a human shit on the fucking tree?
5059280	5060280	Dad, I don't have time for this.
5060280	5061280	What the fuck are you talking about?
5061280	5062280	Did I take a shit?
5062280	5063280	What am I?
5063280	5064280	What am I, a fucking animal?
5064280	5066280	I'm your son.
5066280	5067280	Can you excuse me?
5067280	5068280	I'm trying to stack...
5068280	5069280	I got blocks over here.
5069280	5071280	I got the A and the B next to each other.
5071280	5072280	I'm trying to put the C.
5072280	5074280	I just figured out I can put them in the middle.
5074280	5076280	Does that mean in order to get high I have to milk a pyramid?
5076280	5077280	All right, I'm sorry.
5077280	5078280	Yeah, well...
5078280	5079280	I'm sorry.
5079280	5080280	You're sorry?
5080280	5081280	I'm fucking sorry.
5081280	5082280	I'm two years old.
5082280	5086280	You just wasted a tenth of my life with this shit.
5086280	5087280	I'm sorry.
5087280	5088280	I'm sorry.
5088280	5089280	Everybody's like, oh, you're so young.
5089280	5090280	Yeah, no shit.
5090280	5094280	That means you're fucking with me and draining my life.
5094280	5097280	Like, if I was 40, I'd be like, yeah, fuck it.
5097280	5099280	Let's do nothing all day.
5099280	5100280	Fuck you.
5100280	5101280	I just got here.
5101280	5102280	I'm not a fuckup.
5102280	5104280	I'm going to shit everywhere.
5104280	5105280	But I didn't.
5105280	5106280	I didn't know.
5106280	5107280	I didn't.
5107280	5108280	I didn't.
5108280	5109280	You know what?
5109280	5110280	You know what?
5110280	5113280	You need to tend your own garden.
5113280	5114280	You know what?
5114280	5115280	I just...
5115280	5116280	I'm fucking like...
5116280	5117280	I might be a famous pianist.
5117280	5118280	You don't know.
5118280	5119280	Don't fuck with me.
5119280	5120280	Fuck you.
5120280	5121280	Fuck you.
5121280	5122280	Don't look at me like that.
5122280	5123280	It's illegal for you to hit me.
5123280	5124280	Boo!
5124280	5125280	Boo!
5125280	5126280	I've got you by the fucking balls.
5126280	5127280	Excuse me.
5127280	5128280	I gotta answer the...
5128280	5129280	Oh, yeah, go ahead.
5129280	5130280	Boo!
5130280	5131280	Boo!
5132280	5133280	Hello.
5133280	5135280	My name is Officer Davis.
5135280	5139280	We got some reports of a two-year-old pooping on tree stems.
5139280	5140280	Really?
5141280	5142280	What?
5142280	5143280	Excuse me?
5143280	5144280	What?
5145280	5146280	Sorry, I don't hear so good.
5146280	5150280	My eardrums are still like gelatinous membranes.
5150280	5152280	We have a report that we...
5152280	5154280	Someone matching your description...
5154280	5155280	I'm going to stop you right there.
5155280	5156280	We have a report.
5156280	5157280	Was pooping on a dark bark?
5157280	5158280	You know what your problem is?
5158280	5160280	Your problem is you have reports.
5160280	5161280	Okay?
5161280	5163280	My problem is I have fucking blocks.
5163280	5165280	Do you want me to refill that, sir?
5165280	5166280	Yes, please.
5166280	5167280	Your coffee?
5167280	5168280	Thank you.
5168280	5169280	We'd like to bring you down...
5169280	5170280	We'll do it.
5171280	5173280	I'm supposed to trust this system?
5173280	5177280	Can we bring you down to the station and ask you some questions, young man?
5177280	5178280	You can bring me anywhere.
5178280	5179280	I can't fight you back.
5179280	5180280	My muscles are pudding.
5180280	5184280	Do you want a lawyer up or do you want to just answer questions?
5184280	5186280	I don't know what a lawyer is.
5186280	5187280	Is that the same as a gorilla?
5187280	5188280	I don't know.
5188280	5189280	I don't know shit.
5189280	5191280	And that's exactly what a jury's going to find out.
5191280	5192280	If you've got nothing...
5194280	5196280	If you have nothing to hide, then you have no...
5196280	5198280	There's no reason that you couldn't come down.
5198280	5199280	I got plenty to hide.
5199280	5200280	Can you seek it?
5200280	5201280	You don't know?
5201280	5202280	I just...
5202280	5203280	Everything's hidden from me.
5203280	5205280	I don't have any persistence of motion.
5205280	5207280	You can hide from me behind a towel.
5207280	5211280	Where were you two and a half hours ago?
5212280	5213280	What's time?
5214280	5215280	See you, dude.
5215280	5216280	See you, buddy.
5216280	5217280	You're fucked and you know it.
5217280	5219280	If you had anything on me, I'd be in cuffs.
5219280	5220280	Go fuck yourself.
5223280	5225280	A, B, C, A, B, C, E.
5225280	5227280	Can't get in my office, Davis.
5227280	5230280	This department, you cost this department a million dollars
5230280	5231280	talking to that shit, baby.
5231280	5232280	Oh, Chief.
5233280	5234280	Chief, I...
5236280	5238280	You keep messing up and it's going to beat my ass.
5238280	5239280	Chief, I...
5239280	5241280	I want you to find out who shit on that...
5241280	5243280	Chief, I got this motherfucker, Chief.
5243280	5245280	I fucking got him.
5245280	5247280	That's what you said about the Jablonski's win.
5247280	5248280	No, I fucking...
5248280	5251280	You give me fucking two hours and I fucking got this kid.
5251280	5253280	You cost this department two billion dollars
5253280	5255280	on that ass case.
5255280	5257280	Nah, aye, it's up my ass.
5257280	5258280	Chief, I will...
5258280	5260280	I will wager my fucking badge on this case.
5260280	5262280	I fucking got this kid.
5262280	5263280	All right.
5263280	5264280	I got him.
5264280	5265280	You go talk to that baby.
5265280	5267280	We are going to get fired.
5267280	5268280	All right.
5271280	5273280	Did he come here?
5273280	5275280	Did he come to the house?
5278280	5279280	Mr...
5279280	5281280	There is no mister.
5281280	5282280	Mr. Lee...
5282280	5283280	You want to talk...
5283280	5286280	My name is Pookie, Papa, Chi Chi, Tony.
5286280	5288280	What do you want me to call you?
5288280	5289280	What do you want me to call you?
5289280	5292280	His name is Steven. His name is Steven.
5292280	5293280	Okay, Steven.
5293280	5295280	Steven, what did you have for lunch today?
5295280	5297280	Do you remember what you had for lunch?
5297280	5298280	What did I want to have for lunch?
5298280	5299280	No, what did you have for lunch?
5299280	5301280	Birthday cake. Sorry, I answered the first question.
5301280	5303280	What did you eat for lunch today?
5303280	5305280	Fucking strained something, veggie something.
5305280	5306280	What if I told you...
5306280	5307280	An airplane.
5307280	5308280	An airplane came in for lunch.
5308280	5309280	What if I...
5311280	5312280	A choo-choo train.
5312280	5313280	I ate a bunch of lies.
5313280	5314280	That's what I ate.
5314280	5318280	Sir, I'm going to show you a picture of a tree.
5318280	5320280	Do you recognize this tree stump, sir?
5320280	5321280	Sure.
5321280	5322280	T.T.
5322280	5323280	Yeah?
5323280	5324280	Yeah, ta-ta.
5324280	5325280	Keep trying.
5325280	5326280	T.T., ta-ta.
5326280	5327280	Whatever the fuck, bro.
5327280	5328280	All right.
5328280	5329280	Do you want to nap?
5329280	5330280	Do you want to time out?
5330280	5331280	Do I want to time out?
5331280	5334280	Because I'll give you a time out for fucking five to ten years for pooping on a tree.
5334280	5336280	You talk to me like that?
5336280	5337280	Uh-huh.
5337280	5338280	What?
5338280	5339280	What?
5339280	5340280	What did you just say?
5340280	5341280	Do you talk...
5342280	5344280	You talk to me like that again?
5344280	5345280	Oh, I'm sorry.
5345280	5346280	You got the leverage right now?
5346280	5347280	I'm sorry.
5347280	5350280	Do you think you have the leverage right now?
5350280	5354280	I'm looking at a picture of a tree stump that's right out in front of your yard.
5354280	5359280	Ahhhh!
5359280	5360280	Ring.
5369280	5371280	J.B.S. get in my goddamn office.
5371280	5372280	Thank you.
5372280	5376280	Sir, that baby tried to be heard all over the damn city.
5376280	5380280	Chief, chief, that is an omission of fucking guilt.
5380280	5383280	I don't give a goddamn what it was, T.G., caca, poo poo.
5383280	5386240	Boo, these words he was using, what was all that about?
5386240	5387840	We got this, son of a bitch.
5387840	5392640	You better get out there and get this conviction.
5392640	5397160	Listen, Mr. Levy, we can go round and round.
5397160	5397920	I'd like that.
5397920	5398420	Yeah.
5402760	5406400	I'd probably go to sleep.
5406400	5408920	Well, I'm sorry.
5408920	5409880	Do I smell something?
5410760	5414200	Well, you just screamed.
5414200	5418280	I think you made a little chocolate poopy.
5418280	5421400	It's not a crime.
5421400	5423120	It's not a crime, but what if I told you
5423120	5426200	that we could match that poopy to the poopy on the tree
5426200	5427280	from earlier today?
5427280	5428720	Steven, show them.
5435520	5438280	We have your mother in here, Mr. Levy.
5439160	5441760	Sorry, just one second.
5441760	5444160	Show him what?
5444160	5447920	Show him that you didn't poop your pants or pooped your pants.
5447920	5449960	I pooped my pants all the time.
5449960	5453000	I know, but right now, I mean, this is the only way you can
5453000	5454240	prove getting on a tree.
5454240	5456720	The only way to prove your innocence.
5456720	5457680	The only way.
5457680	5460240	What if I told both of you that we found trace elements
5460240	5462800	of silly putty around the poop?
5465360	5467560	What if I could match that silly putty to the silly putty
5467560	5470480	that's almost certainly adhered to your penis right now?
5473680	5474600	It's my front yard.
5474600	5475800	I've been there a thousand times.
5475800	5477760	My advice to you right now is to lawyer up, sir,
5477760	5479040	because we've got you.
5479040	5482160	Well, my advice to you is it's a little late to tell me that.
5482160	5484160	You didn't read me any rights.
5484160	5485640	We read you your rights.
5485640	5487720	You just don't know how to read.
5487720	5488560	You know how to read.
5488560	5490560	I don't know how to listen.
5490560	5492120	Yeah, if you knew how to listen, you'd
5492120	5493720	understand what I'm fucking telling you right now.
5493720	5496800	You needed to teach me to hear my rights.
5497000	5501760	I'm going to read you the ABCs of going to jail.
5501760	5505200	I'm going to giggle and spit.
5505200	5508760	Maybe Mr. Panda could be your lawyer.
5508760	5511320	Maybe Mr. Panda Pants could be your lawyer.
5511320	5513360	Maybe Mr. Panda Pants could be your lawyer.
5513360	5515880	Hey, Mr. Panda Pants, these people
5515880	5518720	can't see Mr. Panda Pants.
5518720	5520520	If you believe.
5520520	5521520	That's right.
5521520	5524440	If you believe, I'll represent you in court.
5526800	5533600	Mr. Panda Pants, I even need to put up with this shit.
5533600	5535760	Or can I just take another shit, fall asleep,
5535760	5539040	and want it to be a dentist?
5539040	5544320	If you can count to five, you can go back to sleep, my man.
5544320	5547840	Yeah, Mr. Levy, if you can count to five,
5547840	5551120	as your lawyer advised you, then you can go back to sleep.
5551120	5553360	And this case never happened.
5553360	5555800	Talked to five in my sleep.
5555800	5556520	Well, let's hear it.
5557160	5558360	Don't have to do it for you.
5558360	5559640	Don't have to do it for anybody.
5559640	5561320	It doesn't say anything on the bottom of the room.
5561320	5562960	Sir, you don't have to do anything.
5562960	5564560	You don't have to do anything.
5564560	5565400	That's right, motherfucker.
5565400	5566200	Glad you got here.
5566200	5569720	Would you come here by stroller?
5569720	5570920	That's enough apple juice.
5575640	5577400	Give me a beat.
5577400	5579320	Don't give me a beat.
5579320	5580920	At a certain point, he's going to leave.
5580920	5583160	Everyone's going to leave, and it's going to be me and you.
5583160	5583520	You know what?
5583520	5585840	I'm going to remember who fucking backed me up.
5585840	5587200	I'm going to be a fucking pianist.
5587200	5588360	I'm going to write a concerto.
5588360	5589680	It's going to tear you to pieces.
5589680	5593040	You're going to kill yourself.
5593040	5594320	I don't even need lyrics.
5594320	5596720	You're going to tell C-sharp, that's about me.
5596720	5597220	Whoosh.
5601120	5604120	That's how good I'm going to be, and that's how fucked up you are.
5604120	5604720	Are you still here?
5608640	5611560	This whole thing's being recorded right now.
5611560	5612960	It's all being baby monitored, too.
5616080	5620160	I was born recorded.
5620160	5622040	Part of the fucking new generation, bitch.
5622040	5624640	I got no conscience.
5624640	5626440	The fucking rapture happened a long time ago.
5626440	5627520	I was born without a soul.
5627520	5629040	Just say you pooped on the tree.
5629040	5631280	Just say you can walk out of here today
5631280	5632560	if you say you pooped on the tree.
5632560	5634240	Tell me what to say.
5634240	5637200	Why don't we just look at the baby cam?
5637200	5637700	What?
5640680	5641600	The baby cam.
5641600	5642960	It's recording everything.
5642960	5644000	It will back it up.
5644560	5646240	You got a baby cam in the front yard?
5646240	5647640	You got them all over the place.
5647640	5649080	You fucking are.
5649080	5649960	You fucked us.
5649960	5651520	You fucked us.
5651520	5652440	We're fucking dead.
5652440	5653120	Good job.
5653120	5653800	We're fucking dead.
5653800	5654440	No, you're dead.
5654440	5655960	No, we're dead.
5655960	5657120	You think I go down alone?
5657120	5659960	You fucking mook.
5659960	5663720	Who the fuck put the food in me that turned into that shit?
5663720	5665120	Who the fuck cut the tree down?
5665120	5666000	Whose yard is it?
5666000	5666920	Who called the cops?
5666920	5667560	You fuck.
5667560	5668400	You're fucked.
5668400	5669320	You're fucked.
5669320	5671120	Oh, you're fucked.
5671120	5672200	You want me to count?
5672200	5674600	I'm going to sing.
5674600	5675920	Yes, it was me.
5675920	5677320	I'd like to talk.
5677320	5678120	I got it.
5678120	5679280	All right.
5679280	5680280	You want to wrap it up?
5680280	5681760	You want to wrap it?
5681760	5684960	No, don't.
5684960	5688240	Even as a baby, I know that's not the way to end.
5688240	5689560	That's not.
5689560	5690440	You can sing it out.
5690440	5693480	No, I sing is like a gangster term for talk.
5693480	5694080	OK.
5694080	5696400	I didn't mean I'm going to sing a song.
5696400	5697520	I know what you meant.
5697520	5698760	I know what you meant.
5698760	5700240	Oh, god.
5700240	5701880	All right, we won't look at it.
5702440	5703640	Yeah, don't look at my shit.
5703640	5706360	Why don't we have the police move in?
5706360	5709480	Why don't you just sit down and move in?
5709480	5710640	I ain't ever going to go.
5710640	5711960	What do you think being born is?
5711960	5712960	It's me moving in.
5712960	5714400	Give me a fucking break, man.
5714400	5715880	I shit on your tree, OK?
5715880	5716640	You cut it down.
5716640	5717760	How do you get the tree feels?
5717760	5718240	Whoa, whoa.
5718240	5718880	We just got it.
5718880	5719720	Yeah, I know.
5719720	5720720	I confess.
5720720	5721920	We got a confession.
5721920	5723560	You got that baby to tell the truth?
5723560	5732120	Don't you lie to me, David.
5732120	5733960	I got departments, more departments
5733960	5735080	than a grocery store.
5735080	5736080	No, we have it.
5736080	5737000	They're yelling at me.
5737000	5738360	We have it on baby cancer.
5738360	5739120	We have it on baby cancer.
5739120	5741760	Bring him into the station and make him confess to me.
5745560	5749080	What is your ass, David?
5749080	5751040	You're boss.
5751040	5753120	Mr. Levy, I hate you.
5753160	5755120	I know you're only two years old.
5755120	5755800	I understand.
5755800	5757160	I can overhear him.
5757160	5761480	We're in a scene about a baby pooping criminal,
5761480	5766760	and this police commissioner is still in the show.
5766760	5769080	I want to know more about him, and I am the baby.
5773440	5775240	We could probably take two years of your sentence
5775240	5777840	if you go and confess to him.
5777840	5779320	Do you know what they say about babies?
5779320	5780680	Two years is a life sentence.
5780680	5782640	Yeah.
5782680	5787160	Dissolve to police commissioner's office.
5787160	5788120	Are these real Skittles?
5791160	5792520	I think they're breath mints.
5792520	5795040	You can touch anything you want with you.
5795040	5797160	Wander around.
5797160	5799240	But why did you shit on the tree?
5803520	5804640	Why?
5804640	5808000	Such an easy question for you, isn't it?
5808000	5810120	See from your placard on the wall you went to.
5810120	5811280	What, West Point?
5811320	5811800	I did.
5814680	5817040	Suppose all the furniture was where you could hold it.
5817040	5819440	Well, you waddled.
5819440	5821800	I walk.
5821800	5823840	Do you remember there was a time when you couldn't?
5823840	5825120	Of course not.
5825120	5825800	Of course I do.
5825800	5830440	I had to ask people for things.
5830440	5834560	Accountability, it's why I yell at David so much.
5834560	5835600	Can I smoke?
5835600	5836400	Of course.
5837240	5838520	I think we both should.
5840840	5844320	Commissioner, you and I both have a world of fucking problem
5844320	5845480	here.
5845480	5847480	My diaper is a literal one.
5847480	5849480	Yours is the city.
5849480	5851840	They're both full of shit.
5851840	5853920	They both need to change.
5853920	5856400	You change me without changing yours,
5856400	5858640	you're going to have a lot of shit on your hands.
5860640	5863760	And I'll admit, I'm in no position to stick to my guns.
5863760	5865040	Can't pick a gun up.
5865360	5867440	Can't pick a gun up.
5867440	5869800	Waze as much as I do.
5869800	5871520	I wish I could change that, but laws.
5875080	5876880	But I have an idea.
5876880	5879400	I have an avenue.
5879400	5883360	Two days later, at the Statue of Liberty.
5883360	5894200	Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
5894280	5895960	A lot of babies go through the academy.
5900040	5903040	But most of them don't make it, make it, make it, make it.
5908040	5912200	It's just a baby becomes a cop.
5912200	5914680	And that's how you become a cop, is that the Statue of Liberty.
5917520	5919400	Don't touch it.
5919400	5920760	Seal it up.
5920760	5922200	That's exactly how it happened.
5925080	5925880	Burbate them.
5925880	5927280	I like that when you become a cop,
5927280	5932520	no matter where you live, you're outside the Statue of Liberty.
5932520	5933480	What?
5933480	5936800	What's our job?
5936800	5939120	To protect the statue, or just liberty?
5944400	5946600	I mean, look, I've never seen Family Guy, don't they?
5946600	5947640	Isn't that just their bit?
5947640	5949280	What, the baby can talk, right?
5949280	5950760	And he's just like, oh, I'm a baby.
5950760	5951560	Yeah, who cares?
5951560	5953080	I thought that's what you were doing.
5953080	5955000	Oh, I don't know.
5955000	5956000	Ask my therapist.
5956000	5958880	I don't watch fucking Family Guy.
5958880	5960680	Shots fired, fired, fired.
5960680	5962280	Shots fired to my therapist.
5962280	5964440	I'm like, watch the fucking show.
5964440	5965920	God damn it, I've given you, look,
5965920	5967480	would you just watch Rick and Morty?
5967480	5970720	Jesus Christ, fucking therapist.
5970720	5972200	She's just doing it because she knows.
5972200	5974000	We've been over this.
5974000	5975440	Why does she not watch the show?
5975440	5977480	I'm like, Jesus Christ, I'm having such a chow.
5977480	5978840	I got to weigh this and then that.
5978840	5980760	And I'm trying to think of, oh, wait a minute.
5980760	5983000	And she's like, you know, Peter Griffin has the thing.
5983320	5984920	I'm like, who the fuck are you talking about?
5984920	5987400	What the fuck are you talking about?
5987400	5989160	What are you talking about?
5989160	5990600	Peter Griffin.
5990600	5991920	I want to know what was her,
5991920	5994200	I want to know what her example was.
5994200	5996800	She used some example, like he had an angel and a devil.
5996800	5997840	I'm like, that's the one reference
5997840	5998760	you don't even have to make,
5998760	6000760	but I don't want to make her sound like a bad therapist.
6000760	6002960	She just doesn't understand television.
6005920	6008840	She understands the human brain, you know?
6008840	6011160	But then she's like, TV, she's like, you know, it's funny.
6011160	6012240	It reminds me of this thing.
6012320	6013840	There was this land of the lost.
6013840	6014680	I'm like, bitch.
6018840	6020720	Update your Netflix.
6021640	6022760	It's not how Netflix works.
6022760	6023600	You don't update it.
6023600	6025240	And then the show's getting newer.
6025240	6026240	It's not how it works.
6027600	6029240	Land of the lost, update.
6029240	6030080	Girls.
6030080	6030920	Oh, girls.
6034240	6038360	The sleet stacks turn into millennial women
6038360	6039920	finding themselves in New York.
6040920	6044640	All right, you know, look,
6044640	6046080	if it's that hard to steal focus,
6046080	6048240	it means the show's going well.
6048240	6049880	The soup's almost done.
6050840	6052240	Rob's right.
6052240	6054720	All soup is inevitably almost done.
6057840	6060120	And you don't know, I can't tell.
6060120	6062440	What the fuck is going on?
6062440	6065160	I set you up and you were fucking, let's end the show.
6065160	6066000	I guess.
6066000	6066840	But it's just reminding me of this one thing,
6066840	6070520	like there's this podcast called the No Sleep Podcast.
6070520	6073160	It's been on for like 11, 12 seasons.
6073160	6076320	I'm obsessed with like Creepypasta, like podcasts.
6076320	6078120	I was listening to this thing called Creepy,
6078120	6080200	but then I realized that he keeps referencing.
6080200	6083120	But it's for some reason Canadians are like,
6083120	6086080	like as a nationality, like Canadians are the ones
6086080	6087640	that are really into Creepypasta.
6087640	6090320	Like it's sort of like the Irish are into bootlegging
6090320	6091160	in the 20s.
6092160	6093760	Like it's like the Canadian will look back
6093760	6096240	when they're like, oh, the Creepypasta phenomenon,
6096280	6098400	of course, was being trafficked into podcasting
6098400	6100280	by the Canadians for some reason.
6100280	6102640	And so funny, like when people are,
6102640	6107640	I, it's just so hard to scare me when you say a boot.
6107920	6109240	Like it's so funny.
6110600	6112000	You can't fucking do it.
6112000	6115560	It's like, oh, and then I looked and the monkey paw
6115560	6116880	was a ruined the thing.
6116880	6120200	And it's just like, it's so adorable Canadian.
6120200	6122600	What's Creepypasta?
6123000	6126680	I think that's just a shorthand for like ghost stories
6126680	6130480	that in the incarnation of like forum posts and stuff
6130480	6133920	where sometimes the line between reality is blurred
6133920	6136160	as they always were with campfire stories,
6136160	6138200	but now in the digital age, Creepypasta,
6138200	6140480	I think it comes from copy paste.
6140480	6141560	So like,
6141560	6146560	Copy pasta, which is a copied and pasted text block.
6147200	6148960	I think the earmark of a good one.
6148960	6153280	Just information.
6153280	6155520	Why would you, what, why would you do that?
6155520	6157440	Why would you do, no one would do anything.
6157440	6158360	It just evolved.
6158360	6159960	That it's just kids like telling each other
6159960	6161640	ghost stories online, you know?
6161640	6162880	Same thing as a campfire,
6162880	6164120	but they don't have campfires anymore
6164120	6165440	cause the world is on fire.
6168000	6170280	Did they have to do with food?
6170280	6171880	No, because I don't know.
6171880	6174040	It just derives language fucking thrives.
6174040	6175760	It just fucking turns into other shit.
6175760	6176600	Language just lives.
6176600	6178720	There's a creepy text block
6178720	6180680	that's been copied and pasted.
6181720	6182920	Creepypasta.
6182920	6184040	But I will say this,
6184040	6186360	the one I listened to, creepy,
6186360	6187440	there's a guy who goes,
6187440	6189920	this is creepy.
6189920	6192960	The biggest collection of the most,
6194200	6196760	what can I just pull it up and like pull it up?
6196760	6200240	Because the thing is the way that the guy says the word pasta
6200240	6201920	in Creepypasta, it's like,
6201920	6203760	there's something like he can't escape.
6203760	6206080	Like he's, and when I say old man,
6206400	6207360	I'm sure he's my age,
6207360	6208320	but I'm just saying like,
6208320	6210120	he's so old that he like,
6210120	6212440	he can't say that phrase Creepypasta
6212440	6215120	without really making it sound delicious.
6215120	6217600	Where it's like, I never,
6217600	6220680	like I just want to,
6220680	6222800	I like just indulge me
6222800	6224400	and cause I'm in a good mood.
6224400	6225240	And thank you.
6225240	6227320	Thank you all for another week of.
6227320	6235480	You know, in one of these days,
6235480	6237280	I may have something really specific to thank you guys
6237280	6239280	for like, over the weeks and things,
6239280	6241080	there may be certain battles that have to be fought
6241080	6242120	in silence and things.
6242120	6243920	And I really owe you guys a fucking lot.
6243920	6246840	And we'll talk about it on the other side of,
6246840	6248360	of a tunnel that's going to be worth it.
6248360	6253360	But I just wanted to play the intro of,
6256160	6257000	let's see.
6257000	6258680	Let's hear how delicious this pasta is.
6258680	6260280	I'm afraid my battery is going to go up,
6260280	6261120	but that'll be just,
6261120	6262240	that'll be cool. Oh no.
6262240	6263080	All right.
6263080	6263920	You know what, Shrav?
6264560	6265400	You're just,
6265400	6266800	Oh, you're too bad, aren't we?
6266800	6268920	Didn't you get an expensive one?
6268920	6272280	What are they going to make this thing work for people
6272280	6273120	that just.
6273120	6274800	The podcast app is so bad
6274800	6277840	and it's fun to watch you go through that live.
6277840	6280080	It's so, it's really bad.
6280080	6280920	I just want to also,
6280920	6282040	I wrote one for the,
6282040	6284840	if you're a Patreon subscriber that he'll do one that I,
6284840	6286040	and I wrote one and.
6287120	6288040	Did he read it yet?
6288040	6290520	Well, it's not like he recorded it.
6290520	6291480	Oh, cool.
6291480	6293480	Levy, can we have a second phone on this?
6294480	6296400	Spencer's got his phone out.
6296400	6297840	I just set it down though.
6297840	6299440	It's the only reason at this point.
6300880	6301720	I was going to help,
6301720	6302560	but I was like,
6302560	6304280	Nah, well,
6304280	6306200	cause you knew it was going to be hard.
6306200	6308280	Well, I just thought that you were most of the way there,
6308280	6310840	but I think,
6310840	6312600	you know, I think it's largely like,
6312600	6314280	Oh, you have bad signal in here.
6314280	6315880	My phone's at 5% and there's no signal
6315880	6316720	and it's 10 o'clock.
6316720	6317560	Well, it's just,
6317560	6318680	it's something to look forward to.
6318680	6319680	We'll see you for next time.
6319680	6320680	All right. Oh yeah.
6320680	6322200	Sorry if I come back now.
6324360	6327120	I have a lot to talk about with Creepypasta podcasts.
6327120	6328120	It's been my new thing.
6328120	6328960	Why don't Dan,
6328960	6331560	why don't you just cast one spell in D&D right now?
6331560	6332400	Like, just like,
6332400	6333240	like,
6333240	6335160	let's just say that we're in the middle of a thing
6335160	6336720	and you cast one,
6336720	6338120	one spell.
6338120	6339600	Do I have any spells left?
6339600	6340440	No.
6343240	6344200	Well, let's say,
6344200	6346720	let's say that Dan had rested and he has one.
6346720	6348000	Let's say Dan rested.
6348000	6350040	That's fucked up.
6350040	6353120	I'm sick of this resting.
6353120	6354880	You have spell slots.
6354880	6356040	You need to rest.
6356040	6356880	All right.
6356880	6357720	Eight hours.
6357720	6358920	Who has a spell among us right now?
6358920	6359760	No one.
6361600	6362440	Well, you all have,
6362440	6363280	you all have.
6363280	6366480	You don't fucking DM from the bottom.
6366480	6367320	PM.
6367320	6368520	The PM, yeah.
6368520	6369840	You don't DM from the PM.
6369840	6371360	You don't DM from the PM.
6371360	6372680	You don't DM from the PM.
6372680	6374240	You don't DM from the PM.
6374240	6375760	You don't A-DM.
6375760	6376760	Well, then Dan,
6376760	6377600	use a weapon.
6377600	6378440	Like, do it, do it,
6378440	6379280	and action.
6379280	6380320	I use my cudgel.
6380320	6382680	Oh, it's great.
6382680	6383520	Yeah.
6383520	6384360	That'll make sense,
6384360	6385320	without context.
6385320	6386160	There you go.
6386160	6387840	You hit him right in the dick.
6389600	6390440	We were all so lucky
6390440	6391800	I didn't drive here tonight.
6392760	6393600	Yeah, man.
6393600	6394440	Why?
6394440	6395280	What happened?
6397000	6398040	I drank a lot.
6400520	6402160	Tonight?
6402160	6403000	Every night.
6403000	6403840	Okay.
6403840	6405720	I just recently got a car.
6405720	6406560	Okay.
6406560	6407400	Yeah.
6407400	6408960	I feel lucky.
6408960	6410540	I feel so lucky.
6412720	6416360	I feel so lucky that you didn't drive.
6416360	6418640	And your phone is at five percent.
6418640	6420120	I feel lucky.
6426640	6428280	Have a little soup.
6432280	6433120	Hey, that's Peter's thing
6433120	6433960	that takes you home tonight,
6433960	6435040	ladies and gentlemen.
