0	13440	Hello, everybody. Welcome to Meltdown Comics. In Hollywood, California, the Meltdown Theater,
13440	18640	Harmon Town is now in session. Please put your hands together for the mayor of Harmon
18640	36400	and Dan Harmon. Fun times, fun times at Harmon Town. I'm overcompensating. I'm a little exhausted.
36400	44080	I'm bone sober and a little wiped out. We're back on the thick of it over at Community,
44080	51680	and I'm very excited about the work we're doing, but it's very thorough work. A lot of very young
51680	58560	writers being baptized by fire over there at Paramount right now. Where are you going, boss?
58560	65680	I'll be right back. I'm going to get you some ice cream. But we're working hard. We start
65680	75520	shooting the first episode of the fifth season tomorrow morning at 7am. And then at lunchtime,
76400	82480	we table read the second episode, which we're supposed to be finished with by now. That's why
82480	87600	we're hard at work back at the Keebler Tree. Do you have to go back to work right after the show?
87600	91680	Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're going back into Paramount or from home? I'm going to go back to Paramount.
92400	97040	I'll probably sleep on my couch there in my little office. Chris McKenna's got it worse. He said he
97040	101760	was up at four this morning. I didn't ask him why, but he's got to get some sleep or something.
101760	106800	That's crazy. He's got a kid, too. That's probably why. That's probably the 4am thing. I don't know.
106800	111040	I didn't ask him. I had to run out the door. But anyways, I'm excited about what's going on over
111040	117360	there, and I'm just doing my best to make all you little rapscallions happy. But I am a little
117360	122000	wiped out, so I don't know what generates my entertainment on the nights when I'm really
122000	133440	entertaining. Is it my boundless energy or liquor or fear or anxiety? I don't know.
134160	137520	You could draw off the energy. I'm not just saying this in an ass kissy or the greatest
137520	141360	audience in the world, but it's not a huge audience, but you've got twice the energy of a
141360	151440	full house. It's a good idea. It's really good. Yeah, I feel like I'm kind of betraying it. I feel
151440	158000	like we should do something to earn their energy. Let's spin the wheel of strangers.
161440	163600	There's no wheel for you listening.
163600	174800	Who's in deep emotional pain in the audience? All right, a hand went up. There he is. It's Levi.
176400	178560	Levi to the stage. I know this guy.
180880	186640	Grab that mic. Hello, Levi. I feel I owe it to the home listener to state that you are
187360	194640	your long blonde kind of Carrie Elwes from Princess Bride hair. You also have his mustache
194640	199280	from Glory, which is nice. It's my three musketeers mustache. It's very nice. It's very nice. You've
199280	206560	got a nice wide-banded corduroy maroon coat and your barefoot. Jeff is fucking describing me. This
206560	211920	is awesome. Yeah, barefoot to the show. Fuck shoes. Did you walk down Hollywood sidewalks?
212640	217920	Actually, I washed my shoes before I came here out of courtesy. So you washed your shoes. Oh,
217920	222400	wait. Fucking shoes. I'm really fucked up. I'm sorry. I washed my feet before I came here.
222400	226320	I say I think you washed your shoes and you left them in the dryer. That's why they're still
226320	232320	hanging back on the line. So I got to hurry up and get back there. So Levi, we met in Madison.
232320	238880	Madison. And you were you were driven up there during the Harman town tour from Idaho. Iowa.
238880	246960	Same thing. I owe whatever. And where you live on the banks of the Mississippi. Yes. And your big,
246960	253280	big old Dan Harmon fan. Yeah, I have my girlfriend a thing for that. But you are I'm not a fan,
253280	258880	really. You're kind of I've never had a hero. So I don't know how to put that in terms. But like,
259920	265280	whatever that word is, in comparison to you, what do you find her as a person? What do you
265600	271760	find heroic about Dan? He's fucking getting up here and like, this is scary shit. And I'm an
271760	277600	actor. I do theater and stuff. But you guys are freaking me out right now. But not only that,
277600	283280	but he gets up here and he doesn't do a bit. He doesn't put on shtick. He's just Dan Harmon up
283280	289200	here. And all of us love him for that. Don't we like that? That's the fucking reason I came here.
290160	296640	Can I sit down? I'm like, No, yeah, please sit down. Put your feet up.
298480	302480	Apology, Jeff. Can you show the crowd the bottom of your feet? I just got a glimpse of this.
303360	313120	Holy, what in the Bangladesh? Yeah. Sooty. Yeah, that's your city, guys. Let's call your feet
313120	319200	sooty. Were you cleaning a chimney before you came over here? Just right in the car, Jeff. All
319200	323600	right. Well, that's what the bottom of shoes probably are like. And that's why I don't wear
323600	328800	them. I was the same thing. Yeah. What about why not shoes? Well, besides not shoes and actually,
328800	332960	it's just more comfortable for me. You guys are personally the weird ones. Every all of you guys
332960	338000	with shoes. I don't know how you can do it. Like it's so there. Yeah, that's, that's it. You fucking
338080	346000	weirdos. You're all awful people. You, you, you shewers. But unlike, unlike something like if
346000	351840	they all had pink bows on their heads, like shoes have this like deeply practical purpose. No, they,
352560	359520	they shield the human foot from, from broken crack pipes and, and, and, and bees, like,
359520	365360	like half dead bees on the beach. I did. In all honesty, I actually, I said, don't wear shoes.
365360	369840	I did wear it over a pile of dead cows just a couple of weeks ago. You were, you were, you
369840	375200	wear shoes when you have to walk over dead cows. Yeah, I'm not an idiot. It's fucking shit growing
375200	381920	in there. Can we, can we learn a little bit more about walking on dead cows? What do you want to
381920	387760	know? I want to know why you're walking on dead cows. What do you mean? What do I want to know?
388880	394160	Did you have a hand in their death? Yeah, they did before you, they wouldn't be in a pile like
394240	400640	they are. Like that's inhumane. But as an Iowan in California, I can't technically tell you why
400640	406720	I was walking on that dead pile. Besides the fact that it's a rich, rich in a nitrogen,
406720	415200	and which is a good fertilizer for plants. Oh, for the podcast listeners, I was not winking.
415200	421280	That was a twitch. Are you supposed to use entire dead cows for fertilizer?
421280	430240	No, no, no, you can use live cows poop. I'm just making the best of a situation. I rent a property
430240	436080	and I live on a farm, obviously, and the landlord is a terrible person. I really hope someone listens
436080	443280	to this. My address, I'll tell you later. I love you too. I'm sorry, but my landlord just treats
443280	449600	the cows poorly. And then when they die, he says it's awful. It just piles them all on top of each
449600	457600	other and then just let them sit there. And then you go walking on them. You go out to harvest
457600	470640	their nitrogen? Yeah. This is the whole show now. Well, we haven't scratched the surface of Levi.
473200	478080	I have a lot of deep emotional pain. Are we allowed to scratch the surface? Can we talk
478080	484240	about anything? You can talk about me every which way. All right. I can take it. You're not
484240	488080	bullying me. I'm an open book. Yeah, I just want to know what you're comfortable talking about.
488080	493600	Because when we talked in Madison, at the end of our conversation, which I thought was
493600	503200	nice, I wouldn't be shocking you to say you have weird mannerisms. That would be the truth.
503520	511680	That's not it. But then I would say that I'm more comfortable talking to you than
513120	518080	lots of other people who you would assume were not. You're breaking my heart.
518960	527840	In a good way. I don't know what that factor is. You don't wear shoes. You've got the weird
527840	535040	mustache. You've got a manic energy. And you identified yourself as a transgender in Madison.
535920	542160	You identify as a female, you said. But sexually, I wouldn't want to fuck a dude. I don't know.
542160	549520	Actually, a weird story about that. I had a friend of mine a couple months ago.
550720	556240	We had just done some hallucinogens, and we were walking around. It was just me and him. This was
556240	563280	a dude. This is a very lonely guy. I used to have this girlfriend. Only one girlfriend,
563280	567520	and he's been broken up. He really needs companionship. There was one point during
567520	575200	the night where he was like, do you just want to fuck? We were sitting on a bench, and I'm just like,
578080	584800	no. I felt really, really bad because he told me that he had been getting mixed signals off me.
584880	589360	I'm a very flamboyant, flirty person, and I apparently had been doing that to him.
591840	595520	I even made up a joke. Oh, you want me to go jolly Roger you in the bushes?
597840	602560	What's a jolly Roger? That's what he asked. I want to know.
602560	606000	Levi, show him. I need to bend over.
607520	610320	It's a podcast. You'll just have to tell me. We could describe it,
610960	614800	and their laughter would reinforce it. It's not like a jolly rancher.
616000	619760	It's a lot bigger than that. It's more sucking involved.
621120	623120	Lots of pirate booty. What is it? Come on.
624160	627680	Rogering is fucking. A jolly is a happy version of that, I can't say.
627680	631760	That's it? A jolly Rogering is fucking? You get a jolly Rogering?
632800	638640	It's in your window, Dan. It can be whatever. Levi, I thought it was a new thing or a secret
638720	643120	thing. I'm not that cool. You take a two by four and a dead cow and you flip it.
645600	649200	It's not a good joke. Those cows, they lived and they died and they're sad now.
654400	658320	I don't know where to begin. I don't know where to middle and I don't know where to end.
658320	663120	My girlfriend doesn't know where to begin. You made a video that's online.
663120	668320	Maybe you can tell people how to get it to it on YouTube. It's like a Harman Town fan video.
669280	678000	Again, on paper, if someone were to be afraid of someone, this video has all the earmarks and yet
678000	686240	I don't fear you. But the facts on paper about this video, which are that you made it by yourself.
686240	696160	You play me, Jeff, and Aaron and yourself. In the beginning of the video, realizing that Harman
696160	701760	Town is canceled that week, you basically, not to put too fine a point on it, you take rope and
701760	706000	other implements and you abduct each of us. I didn't abduct you and I didn't abduct Spencer.
708640	715680	I lured you with a bong and something else. And then it's you by yourself in this apartment
715680	722080	playing all of us doing a Harman Town show for you yourself, wearing different wigs and
722080	728400	beards and things. But around behind you, I'm assuming this is not set dressing. This is where
728400	734960	you actually live. There is dead cows everywhere. Except for the corner pocket. I saw that and I
734960	739120	was like, oh, that's next to Jeff and that's in between Aaron. That's got to be a weird joke there
739120	746720	about putting pockets in things. Never mind. I haven't seen it. I'm very intrigued. On the walls
746720	751200	behind him, there's like there's like writing on the walls. It looked like like like maybe like,
751200	757440	oh, no, you're talking about my room. Yeah, yeah. It looks like that is a crazy person's room.
760880	767600	If I was designing for a Sirhan Sirhan biopic, like there's like swirls and then there's other
767600	772560	writing and there's like writing and drawing. Yeah. What is what is what is written on the wall?
773520	780720	What is it? Is it just just random thoughts? Like playing community references. Dr. Who quotes
780720	785520	some shit I make up on my own. Actually, I really like it because I have to do it all the time by
785520	789680	myself. I really like it when my friends come over. I have a big box of markers. I'm like,
789680	793040	go ahead and like write whatever the fuck you want to. As long as you don't write over anything,
793040	797600	like, you know, as long as you respect. I have a question for you. So you identify yourself as a
797600	801600	woman, but you still have the male facial hair. Is that is that a conflict? That's acceptance.
802400	809120	Like it goes back to like the fucking thing is I really want to have I want to be able to have
809120	814000	the womb on the inside of me and have kids. That's the only not the only reason to be a woman. But I
814000	819600	mean, that's the reason why I wouldn't like go into a surgery right now. I mean, that's you can't
819600	826080	get that like you'd have to drink a magic potion for that to happen. So did I answer that question?
827040	833440	No, it was it was it was it was it was an answer to three other questions I had.
835120	839680	Well, there's trans, there's transgender where you where you just identify where you just express
839680	844960	as another gender. And then there's transgender as a subset of that people who go, okay,
844960	849440	not only am I expressing as another gender, I'm going to take physical steps. And you're saying,
849440	854720	well, the only the brass ring is having a uterus. And that's not achievable through medical science.
854720	860720	So why not have a mustache? Pretty narcissistic, but to the point, no, that's I mean,
861840	866000	that's basically it. I want to be able to, you know, fuck whoever I want to and have all their
866000	870320	kids and rule the world, you know, it's just simple, but you have a girlfriend, you're with
870320	875600	which you have a technically medically heterosexual relationship, because medically, you, you are,
875600	880400	you have a wiener. Do you have a sexual relationship with your girlfriend? Yes. And so,
880400	889120	so when you guys do it, it's a wiener going into a we we I like that. But I know, I mean,
889120	894400	I hate to sound like a fifth grader. But so so so so is that lesbian sex? Is that like, like,
895440	901440	I mean, is it? I don't know. No, no, like,
901440	910080	like, since I know that I can't have what I want, and to try and, like, force anything other than
910080	915680	that is sort of childish, then it's like, you know, except what something gave you and like,
915680	920240	live with it. Like, I can't, what am I gonna do? How I if I gave you a uterus right now with a
920240	931120	magic wand, and I cannot. No matter how much you know, no, no begging. If but if you had a uterus
931120	937120	right now, would you continue to have a relationship with a woman? Actually, I would own it with her.
937120	941840	Like, I, right. It's so much love. Actually, it's yours and Aaron's love. Like, listen to the
941840	947200	podcast. It's just listening to us almost sometimes, like, not only you guys fighting, but just you're
947200	954480	like, you know, jokes you play couples fight people. Come on. But just you're like, you're
954480	959440	little in jokes with each other. And I was listening on the way here, you're talking about
960080	964320	Aaron was listening to Game of Thrones. And you kept doing like this voice or whatever, or no,
964320	967920	not downtown Abby. And she was like, you take off her headphones, you'd be like,
967920	972160	what the fuck was that? Aaron, nothing is happening. But shut up, you're all right.
972160	975920	And as you put her headphones back on and just like continue, you'd still like fuck with her.
975920	980160	Oh, yeah, I was doing like closed mouth British accents. Yeah, I couldn't remember what I just
980160	985920	listened to it an hour ago. I can't fucking remember. All right. Well, so what you you I said,
985920	989520	who's in deep emotional pain? And you raised your hand just by default. But are you Do you
989520	996960	have any actual short term things that we can help you with? I want to live out here, man. This place
996960	1002480	is like, I don't want to go back to the hellhole that I and not it's not hellhole. I really,
1002480	1008080	the town's okay. It's, it's hard. Well, I don't want to enable anything. But I will say you will
1008080	1014640	fit in more here than honestly, honestly, quite possibly. I was like, God, the people out here
1014720	1019520	fucking awesome. Like, I want to live in people don't you know, you know, like, like, you know,
1019520	1023680	people out here, they come out here because they're chasing their own thing. And then and then some
1023680	1028400	people are successful at building their own thing, which means if you're in a room with a bunch of
1028400	1033040	people, and one guy's got a weird mustache, another guy's got a shark fin on his hat, like,
1033040	1038240	you can never quite dismiss anybody because somebody might be a millionaire or about to become
1038240	1047680	one or it's there's this whole culture of like, you know, it's very hard to for for bigotry and
1047680	1052560	prejudice or other synonyms to gain a foothold here because it's not it's not incentivized
1052560	1056160	financially or socially. Do you guys have an accent? Because I haven't heard one yet.
1057200	1061920	Like, does Los Angeles people do you have an accent? It's kind of a it's kind of I'm trying
1061920	1066240	to tie into that. Like, you don't have like, the valley has a pretty strong one. Yeah.
1071680	1075360	Say what? We have a lack of accent that's technically an accent. Like, we sound like
1075360	1078880	what movies are. So like, I mean, we sound different than other people. So we have an
1078880	1083200	accident. Yeah, I mean, I can tell if I'm if I'm, if I'm talking to somebody, I can tell that
1083200	1087920	they're born and raised in Los Angeles, I can detect the LA speech. But it's just, yeah,
1087920	1092080	it's to me, it sounds like a lack of an accent. I think everybody thinks that they don't have an
1092080	1100160	accent. Right. All right. Well, we can't help you live out here. But but deep emotional pain.
1100880	1107440	Any any any any guidance? Any guidance? Yeah. Do you need you need advice? No, I don't need it. I
1109040	1113760	think I could make it quite on my own. But I guess if you were open to advice,
1113760	1116000	like the first thing that would happen is you'd be covered in shoes.
1118400	1126000	Yeah. You're clearly I believe you when you when a man that is that committed to not wearing shoes
1126000	1129760	says I don't I'm not in the market for advice. Like I would truly believe you because you're
1129760	1135200	like, I sometimes don't tie my shoes. And I'm like belligerent about it. Like don't tell me to tie
1135200	1140000	my shoes. And I bought laceless shoes and like, looking at you, if you're just from the neck up,
1140000	1143680	or even from the waistline, you got the coat on the jacket and you have this neatly trimmed,
1143680	1149440	you know, kind of self what could be considered fancy facial hair. That's kind of fastidious. You
1149440	1155040	I would expect, like spats and some like some, some, some razzle dazzle, like spectators.
1155040	1159120	I'm throwing you off that I have the facial hair. But yeah, you're kind of like you're very,
1159120	1161840	you're very, what kind of walking contradictions, which is great. It makes you
1162640	1167200	I fucking love that's awesome. Do you think that your feet are like hobbit feet like that?
1167200	1170720	Are they like more equipped? They must be like they don't have hair on the top. But no,
1170720	1173680	but I mean, like, are they like, they're like, they're like shoe feet.
1175040	1180160	Developing calluses developed, it's about like a half inch callus on the bottom of my foot.
1180960	1187280	So you are you are you maybe like the shoe wear equivalent of a nudist in that like you're
1187280	1191840	thinking like, maybe we should all not wear shoes. No, no, I when I said that thing about you guys
1191840	1196400	are weird for not wearing shoes, like go ahead, do whatever the fuck you want to like, just don't
1196400	1200800	make me wear shoes like, but where is there a route to that? Is there anything where do that?
1201840	1204960	We know you don't have to know what's going to make you but did you wear them in Madison when
1204960	1208960	we met because it was snowing out there? No, he would. Yeah, I can confirm that you came
1208960	1211840	barefoot in the snow. It was bloody cold out there. I got frostbite.
1215200	1220960	Damn. Yeah, I'm suppose Spencer doesn't wear pants anytime. Like he's always in shorts.
1221840	1223760	I bet people give him shit for that all the time.
1224720	1229520	We're not gonna, but there wasn't some formative experience. There's not some route like kind of,
1229520	1234240	I was forced into shoes. Actually, like many, many of us were.
1236640	1240800	We're kind of weird. We get trained not to touch hot stoves, not to walk into traffic.
1241440	1246720	And I'm not I'm not I'm not picking on you. I'm just like, I'm engaging in the dialectic here.
1246720	1251760	So because I want to find out like because you're different in that you do you are committed to not
1251760	1257520	wearing shoes. And I'm curious like if there was a expound on that you were forced to wear shoes.
1257520	1261120	I'm sorry. Okay, what are you looking for? Like the moment I turn? Yeah, like your, your, your,
1261120	1267200	your, your origin. Yeah, like I stopped wearing your parents were killed by a shoe outside of an
1267200	1273600	opera house. Shoe man, the leave hot story.
1273600	1283520	Is it like a tick maybe is it like a like it's something that helps you feel sweaty man. They're
1283520	1290240	just like gross. It's kind of sweaty sometimes. So you think what do you mean? So shoes are shoes
1290240	1295200	are extra uncomfortable for you. Maybe I can't even wear a pair of sandals like they're just
1295760	1299440	you guys even if I was wearing the sandals now like the people in the back would be able to smell
1299440	1304480	my feet. Oh, but you did don some shoes to walk through the cow carcass field.
1304480	1308560	Safety first, Jeff. Okay. All right. How about frostbite Madison?
1311840	1314640	That was me. Don't take that tone with me Levi.
1316560	1321440	All right. Well, let's have a ham for Levi for joining us. Thank you.
1321440	1329920	I'm going to tell you stuff. Enjoy your stay in Harman town.
1333440	1338320	This episode of Harman town is brought to you by Fulton and Roark. Jeff, you're sick of spilling
1338320	1342960	all your colognes all over the place. You hate liquid colognes. Is that correct? It's my nemesis.
1342960	1347360	It's the thing that gives me nightmare dreams all night long. I can't remember how many times
1347440	1354160	I've walked in on you just covered in sticky wet cologne. I have traveled and broken a bottle of
1354160	1359920	the cologne that I wear. And then my luggage smells like a French whorehouse for the rest of time.
1359920	1364960	Yeah. But Fulton and Roark is a men's fragrance and grooming company that specializes in solid
1364960	1369360	colognes, shave and shower products all designed to make getting ready easier and more enjoyable.
1369360	1372800	Now, when you say solid colognes, do you mean like solid in the jazz sense? Like, wow,
1372800	1378640	that jazz solo was solid. You know, I do mean that, but I also mean physically solid as well.
1378640	1382640	Oh, like a little, like you're talking about a wax based cologne that travels in a little small
1382640	1389760	package that I can't spill all over my luggage and smell like a Mexican tit house. So these are
1389760	1394480	travel friendly wax based colognes that can go anywhere. Plus there's nothing to break or spill.
1394480	1398720	And of course they all smell fantastic. Fantastic. Like a Mexican tit house.
1399120	1405360	I mean, there's, there's different levels of Mexican tit house. I mean, there's, there's,
1405360	1408480	there's the high quality ones. There's the ones that you wish you didn't go to.
1408480	1410960	Right. Yeah. Titas fantástico.
1411520	1414160	Is one of their fragrances called Mexican tit house?
1415040	1421760	Yeah. Kay fantástico. Fulton and Roark's bar soap is designed to exfoliate the skin
1421760	1426160	with or without a washcloth. Also, you don't even have to touch it. It comes in desert in the night.
1426720	1431200	Well, that's amazing. That's, that's literally unbelievable. Did you know,
1431200	1436240	Spencer, that GQ magazine just named their shave cream the very best on the market today?
1436240	1438800	Well, yeah, of course I knew that. Why would, why would you ask?
1438800	1441920	I mean, who am I asking? I mean, this guy, you go to this house,
1441920	1446160	it's like an episode of hoarders. So many back issues of GQ magazine there.
1446160	1449520	Right. And I got to tell you, my house is made out of bricks of cologne.
1449520	1451680	Wax based cologne, I hope. Yeah. Yeah.

1479920	1484640	And different corporation by Fulton and Roark.
1487360	1489680	See, we gave the audience a little treat because they're such a good audience.
1491040	1494240	Brad Levi. That was more exciting than I had expected. That was very nice.
1497440	1500720	That's a fascinating guest to bring up. What else? What else?
1500720	1503120	You did a good job. I'd say too, you did a good interview there. You were actually.
1503120	1511120	What do you think that's about? Why do you think you are?
1511120	1514560	Well, I think it's the same thing. I meet a lot of people after the shows and stuff,
1515840	1520480	and this is nothing on the people. Everybody, all Armenians are fantastic,
1520480	1524720	and many of them are exactly like me, and that's probably a problem, a breakdown,
1524720	1530560	and very little eye contact, and a lot of people get like, I'm very flattered by this,
1530560	1536640	but I have now met a lot of people that are very nervous to be meeting me, and I don't suffer the
1536640	1541920	illusion that it's because there's very much special about me. I think it's because I know
1541920	1546320	how they feel like when I moved to LA and like, oh my God, Bob Odenkirk standing over by the
1546320	1553040	fucking salad dressing, and just doing really weird shit, and saying a lot of weird shit,
1553040	1557280	and feeling really conflicted and weird about having face-to-face encounters with people,
1557280	1561120	just because, you know, I had a one-way relationship with them for a long time,
1561120	1568080	and had built up in my head that they were a symbol. So my point being, I meet a lot of people
1568080	1576400	who are nervous to meet me, and I, even meeting the mailman, am nervous to meet the mailman.
1578400	1584160	I get very uncomfortable. Text messaging saved my life because I could never talk even on the phone
1584160	1588880	to people. I'm like, okay, okay, and everyone thinks I'm a dick, and I can't look at people,
1588880	1594320	and all this stuff, and I don't know, I think, maybe it's just, did you use the crassest language
1594320	1599680	possible to be very efficient about communicating it, and I think he can take it. I think Levi's
1599680	1605840	so crazy, but so honest about it. He's just like, there's nothing, I don't know, there's like,
1606560	1611840	there's nothing's gonna happen, you know? It's like, oh, you just ask him questions,
1611920	1616400	and you're just gonna get answers, whereas somebody else, their head might explode or something.
1616400	1621520	I don't know what it is. No, God, no. I'm saying you're special, my friend.
1623360	1625280	Yeah, no, you did it just right.
1628720	1632400	But now that I know I have that power over you that you could scream at, yeah,
1632400	1640640	it's a roller coaster with me. But it's okay. Let's keep the show special. What do you want?
1640960	1644160	Before we move on, our good friend, I don't know your last name,
1644160	1646800	so I'm going to refer to you as the audience knows you, Beef Fungus Bill.
1648480	1649440	What is your last name, Bill?
1650240	1650720	Moritzen.
1650720	1654320	Moritzen? Moritzen? Moritzen.
1654320	1664160	Beef Fungus Bill has brought us, he famously has brought us tainted meats and a bag of
1664160	1669920	rocks, which are lovely. Tonight, he has brought little kind of lovely wooden shingles with quotes
1669920	1673280	from our show on it, and he's given me a handful, and I think he's got to turn the
1673280	1678560	dispense to the crowd if you guys can. All right, it's like Christmas here.
1682480	1685680	You found a middle ground, but it was that you brought the food,
1686640	1691520	and then we made fun of you because the food had mold on it, and then the following week,
1691520	1698320	in my opinion, what was the passive-aggressive move, you brought inert rocks, as if to say,
1698400	1704080	fine. Rocks, then. But this is like, now this is wood, which...
1704080	1705200	Right, I brought you stones.
1705200	1707280	But it has, like, inscriptions on it, yeah.
1714720	1717840	But the weird thing is that the sticks have words on them.
1717840	1718720	Right, yeah.
1722000	1725040	I ate the country like Pac-Man, that's a quote from me.
1725440	1728160	I don't even know what this one is, but I'm quoted as saying,
1728160	1732800	you fuck Batman, we fuck you. I don't recall the context of that.
1733840	1735280	But it sounds like something I would say.
1736960	1740560	When did I say this? Season 3 of Community was written on anus?
1742880	1743920	It was posted somewhere.
1745840	1746240	Thank you.
1747200	1748000	Levi knows the city.
1748000	1748480	Adderall.
1748480	1750160	No, my friend did. It's not me.
1751600	1753600	Did I mean to say Adderall, and I said anus?
1755200	1759040	I like this one, where I take a bold stance and say,
1759040	1761680	I take adorable shits, they're like unicorn tears.
1765040	1766800	If that one's not correct, I want to take it back.
1768240	1771840	In order to get through all of these, and there's like 62 of them,
1772960	1777600	I had to sort of plumb the depths of the web to wrangle enough of these.
1778560	1780560	So there's almost no duplicates.
1780560	1782000	How many did you bring us tonight?
1782000	1782640	62.
1782640	1783360	62.
1783360	1784000	Yeah.
1784000	1786000	I had planned on 100, but I got tired.
1788240	1790240	We're about, we're probably a little over there, right?
1790240	1791520	I don't know. I can't be bad at that.
1791520	1794400	I am going to be a millionaire, and I'm going to smell like a butt.
1795840	1797600	That's my, that's me being defiant.
1797600	1798960	That's the Dan Harmon guarantee.
1803200	1804080	Oh, your money back.
1805680	1807520	You're not giving me a, can I contribute?
1807520	1808560	Look, you can do whatever you wish.
1808560	1811120	I want to make sure everybody gets one or as close as possible to everyone.
1811120	1812880	Do whatever you wish with them.
1812880	1816080	But I would like to point out some things about this, like the shiny ones.
1816080	1817520	Those are curly maple.
1817520	1819440	The yellow ones are yellow heart.
1819440	1822400	The ones that don't have much grain are basswood.
1822400	1823920	And then the dark ones are cherry.
1827440	1828880	This crowd loves fine wood.
1831200	1833600	I wonder if there's a type of wood that would have been booed.
1835440	1836320	Wingay boo.
1837760	1838800	Too exotic.
1838800	1842560	Well, I would like to donate these to make sure everybody gets at least one.
1843280	1844960	I've got about seven or eight, so if you guys,
1844960	1847120	someone gets shorted once when they can come up and grab one from me.
1847120	1849520	I'm keeping, I'm eating the lead paint of my own ego.
1850880	1852640	I was actually hoping you'd keep that one.
1852640	1853280	I like that.
1853280	1854000	That's very appropriate.
1854000	1855440	That's one of my favorite quotes.
1855440	1855920	All right.
1855920	1856480	Thank you, Bill.
1856480	1857360	You're going to hand them out now?
1857360	1858160	Sure.
1858160	1858640	All right.
1860640	1861120	Wow.
1867360	1868640	It's a special night.
1868640	1873680	I don't know if it's first time visitor accessible for a special night, you know?
1873680	1874240	What do you mean?
1874240	1874800	Well, I don't know.
1874800	1877680	It's not like there's no cats jumping through hula hoops or anything.
1878240	1881600	I'm not telling stories about, about, about jerking off.
1881600	1884320	I came into the green room and you looked like you were half asleep in that.
1884320	1885120	You looked really, really...
1885120	1886480	I'm just mentally exhausted.
1886480	1891840	I, I, I just, you know, I, I, I, I've, I've, I've blogged about this fact.
1891840	1896560	Just writing is, uh, it's, it's, it's, uh, it's so hard.
1896720	1900160	Uh, it's, it's, you know, it's like you, you, you really like, uh,
1901520	1905040	before your body gets physically tired, before your eyes get sleepy, before,
1905040	1910160	before you get frustrated, it's like your brain actually just like, you just wears out.
1910960	1914080	Because you're just like, you're, you're running it like a motor because you're
1914080	1919520	like looking at this fucking blackboard and going like, uh, okay, so why, what does
1919520	1920560	Annie want again?
1920560	1923680	And it's just like, and then one person goes like, well, I think she wants,
1923680	1924880	she wants to feel loved.
1924880	1926960	And then someone else goes, but if she wants to feel loved,
1927920	1930000	how come she's being so mean to Leonard?
1930000	1932880	And I go like, all right, all right.
1932880	1934160	What if it was like Tron?
1934160	1940400	And everyone goes, oh, unless that solves everything.
1942480	1945200	But, uh, yeah, it's just, it's just, you know, problem solving.
1945200	1950240	Push, mushing your brain up against the boundary between it and the shit that you need to know
1950880	1951840	for the whole time.
1951840	1954560	Are the other writers like, have they gotten on board?
1954560	1957360	And are they, are they still intimidated to talk or does everyone?
1957360	1960880	No, no, they're, they're, they're, they're coming out and they're, they're great
1960880	1963600	because now by we've had to break up into smaller groups.
1963600	1968560	There's so many of them and they're so like, all of the circumstances are so strange.
1969280	1973600	But, but I think once we, you know, just takes a while and then we broke up into small groups.
1973600	1978080	And now they're, it's, I don't think, I don't exactly have my ear to the ground,
1978080	1981920	like in terms of gossip and stuff, but it seems like they're all, uh,
1981920	1985920	they all really like each other too, which is kind of a feat with 14 writers.
1985920	1989760	Like they, uh, there's usually one person that's like, Oh, here comes Stanley.
1991520	1992480	Boy, what a mistake.
1994640	1996880	How do you, what's your feeling about the, uh, about the episodes?
1996880	2000800	Like, can you compare this to how you felt going into previous seasons?
2000800	2007200	I feel better about 501 than I felt going into previous seasons, but I don't, I wouldn't,
2007680	2011120	I can't bet my life because it's just so, I don't know.
2011120	2012000	I'm so close to it.
2012000	2015200	I can't, I, I, uh, I don't, I don't, I don't know.
2015200	2018560	Are there any like nods or winks to the fact that you're back?
2018560	2022240	Is there like, like, like the fact that like, is there any kind of
2022240	2026240	dealing with that or are you just kind of just picking up where last season left off?
2026240	2031440	It, I mean, the, the, the circumstances of, of coming back and having to do a fifth season,
2031440	2036320	like, like they automatically kind of generate a context of nothing and winking.
2036320	2037680	Like, I don't know how to explain it.
2038240	2040800	Like we're, you know, we're getting, we're getting back to basics.
2040800	2043520	And so that feeling is in the air.
2043520	2047520	And so I'm not, I'm not, I'm not doing a bunch of inside jokes and going like,
2047520	2049040	well, what happened last year?
2049040	2054720	Boy, I had a bad taco.
2054720	2056080	Do you have a bad taco?
2056080	2057680	We all had bad tacos.
2059760	2061360	Now it's all gone.
2061360	2062400	Turn on the fan.
2062400	2067760	Every time, every time there's a reference to something that happened last season, it's foghorn.
2073040	2075280	I mean, that's not entertaining, you know, to do that.
2075280	2076320	It would be pretty entertaining.
2076320	2080240	I think, I think, I think you get mileage out of that for an act or two.
2081520	2089040	Uh, let's do, let's do, let's do Q and A. I don't know why I spun a wheel.
2089360	2092560	Anybody have any questions?
2095200	2096080	Jesus Christ.
2097840	2101200	Like, camera over here as a documentary guy.
2101200	2103760	Neil Berkeley, everybody, the maker of our documentary.
2107440	2109920	If your question is, how's the documentary going?
2109920	2111440	Clearly it's not finished.
2113040	2114720	Still some shots to pick up.
2114720	2120320	And that's how I learned about America.
2122480	2123840	Now get the fuck out of here.
2123840	2124320	I'm kidding.
2126000	2126800	What was your question?
2128560	2132080	If you could be aware of version of any animal during a full moon.
2133120	2136240	All right, if Dan could be aware version of any animal during a full moon,
2136240	2137280	which animal would that be?
2137280	2138880	Aware version of any animal.
2141840	2143280	I would, I would, I would,
2143280	2144800	you could be aware of cat.
2144800	2146560	I guess you could, you know, you can be aware of whatever you want.
2147920	2148320	Right.
2148320	2150560	So yeah, where does not, it's not wolf specific.
2150560	2152240	You could be aware whale.
2155200	2156800	You didn't ask me, but I'm going with where whale.
2160240	2162960	And I, I just, there had no control over this, right?
2162960	2165360	And so every full moon, all right.
2165360	2170160	Well, I just, I just want to, I have to think practically because, uh,
2170160	2174720	I don't keep track of time very well.
2174720	2178000	And I just want to make sure that like, I'm not like in a play, like,
2178000	2181280	like if it was a tiger, then there's places where that's not going to be cool.
2182560	2185520	So, so I feel like it's a boring answer,
2185520	2189680	but I feel like I just go regular house cat so that, so that I maximize my,
2190560	2197280	my ability to like hide, but also blend in and, and get away.
2197280	2198880	And if anything should go wrong,
2198880	2200880	I'm kind of wasting the power by just being scared of it.
2200880	2203840	I guess I started dealing with it like a disease.
2203840	2205840	Like, like I have weird diabetes.
2207200	2209760	I guess I'd stack some Snickers bars and, uh,
2209760	2213200	so you're a human, but I would turn into a part human part whale.
2213200	2214400	That's probably a bad idea.
2214400	2215360	Would I be able to?
2215360	2216720	Oh, oh, oh, it's a way.
2216720	2217840	I'm aware cat.
2217840	2219840	Like, uh, like I'm not just turning into a cat.
2221200	2224800	Where whale wouldn't work because I'd have to, I just, I would turn it.
2224800	2227360	The moon would come out and I would just be a whale.
2227440	2229840	I'm sitting here at this podium and I would tie.
2230560	2231600	Yeah, okay.
2231600	2233760	I would have to be near a body of water at all times.
2233760	2237120	Well, then maybe like a were chimp so that people could barely tell the difference.
2237120	2243120	Like, like you just, you just feel like, uh, but, uh, yeah, I don't know.
2243120	2244080	I, um, I'm Terry.
2244080	2245040	I don't want to be aware.
2245040	2246160	Okay. Well, fuck it then.
2247200	2254000	Just go for, uh, I'll, I would be aware, uh, aware, like, uh, uh, otter.
2254800	2257280	What about like a were bear?
2257280	2257920	That's kind of cute.
2259280	2262480	You're kind of a bear in the gateway.
2264080	2265680	All right. I'll be a, I'll be a were bear.
2268480	2271840	Cause I wear, I was thinking otter because again, I was thinking I would like to be an otter
2271840	2276400	cause they like swim on their back and they, they crack open, crack open clams on their tummy.
2278240	2279600	Were otter is awesome.
2279600	2283680	But if you're a were otter, you'd be like a six foot guy eating clams on his tummy.
2284320	2285840	You could do that as a were bear.
2287200	2287920	It wouldn't matter.
2289920	2291520	But the otter would have to rampage.
2291520	2292240	What would that wear?
2292240	2296320	Where otters, uh, enemies be clams and like mollusks and stuff.
2296320	2301440	I think you're just, you're confusing it because, uh, wolves rampage and were wolves.
2301440	2302400	Therefore after rampage.
2302400	2306720	I think if you were a were fish, you know, he, he, he had the caveat that you would have to rampage.
2306720	2307760	I don't think I'll wear.
2307760	2310480	Oh, okay.
2310480	2311520	So you have to rampage.
2312560	2312800	All right.
2312880	2313360	Were bear.
2313360	2313840	I'm just gonna.
2313840	2314800	Yeah, that's got it.
2314800	2315840	All right.
2315840	2316320	All right.
2316320	2317120	Two more questions.
2319120	2319600	All right.
2319600	2320000	No.
2320000	2320480	All right.
2322480	2324480	Are you worried about what to colonize?
2324480	2325680	It's perfect moon colony.
2325680	2326160	Right.
2326160	2327680	That you have nothing to rant about.
2328480	2329200	Moon colony.
2329200	2329440	All right.
2329440	2331760	The question is, thank you for getting us back on track.
2331760	2332320	What's your name?
2333520	2333840	Greg.
2335200	2336320	Kind of an ordinary name.
2338480	2339520	I just, we had Levi.
2339520	2340160	What was your name?
2341120	2341680	Chud.
2341680	2341920	What?
2343680	2344240	Not really.
2345200	2345520	Chud.
2346400	2348240	Like cannibalistic humanoid underground dweller.
2349760	2350640	Is it really chud?
2351520	2352880	That's what I've gone by.
2352880	2353200	Oh, you're not.
2353200	2354080	You weren't born chud.
2355600	2356800	That would be fucking awesome.
2358480	2359120	All right.
2359120	2360560	How did the name chud generate?
2361280	2363360	It's kind of boring.
2364320	2367440	In fifth grade, I figured I was an adult so I can name myself.
2370480	2371920	And a judge taught you a lesson.
2373600	2376880	He said he named himself because he became an adult.
2376880	2378000	He thought he could name himself.
2378560	2381520	I decided, when I was a kid, when I turned like 13,
2382160	2385600	like coming into my own, like having identity things,
2385600	2390880	I decided that my, as a writer, my name was D.R. Harmon.
2390880	2392640	Even though my middle name is James.
2392640	2395200	My, but I was at D.R. Harmon.
2395200	2397200	And I, when people would say, what's the R stand for?
2397200	2398320	I'd say, Rudebaga.
2402000	2402480	Yeah.
2403680	2404960	I didn't, I'm not proud of it.
2405680	2408720	I appreciate my candor.
2408720	2410400	I didn't come here to win a popularity contest.
2410400	2411360	Did we ever talk about in the show,
2411360	2412880	we must have talked about that you were,
2412880	2415040	you, your nickname was Pac-Man for a while.
2415040	2415680	Yeah, yeah.
2415680	2417680	Because you, did we talk about that in the show?
2417680	2419360	Yeah, I wanted to, yeah, you know,
2419360	2421600	kids, they want to know who they are, what's their deal.
2421600	2422800	I didn't really have anything.
2422800	2426960	So I just jumped on Pac-Man, just called myself Pac-Man.
2426960	2431440	I made a windbreaker that had like a little felt Pac-Man on it.
2431440	2432400	I didn't make the windbreaker.
2432400	2433440	I made the felt Pac-Man.
2434400	2436640	And I would just like, as everything was Pac-Man,
2436640	2439920	like in Wisconsin, like they appreciate,
2439920	2442160	people appreciate knowing what to get you for Christmas.
2442160	2444320	You know, it's like, everyone has a totem, you know.
2444320	2448160	We have the moms a mouse and get dad a belt buckle and,
2448160	2449360	you know, everybody's got a gimmick.
2450400	2454480	That's a terrible thing, gift to get if you're a child abuser.
2454480	2456560	Yeah, get dad more belt buckles.
2462640	2464720	What are you having a nice, heavy, sharp one?
2464720	2468400	Yeah, the shit was okay.
2468400	2470880	The question was, am I worried that when we colonize the moon,
2470880	2472240	I won't have anything to rant about?
2473760	2475120	You know, that's the goal.
2475120	2476160	I don't enjoy ranting.
2485920	2487200	I'm just sitting here looking adorable.
2487200	2487920	I'm not doing anything.
2489680	2491600	I do it because I have to.
2491680	2495440	It's like, does a car enjoy producing carbon dioxide?
2496080	2498080	Oh, it's, it's combusting.
2498080	2499040	It's got shit in it.
2499040	2501200	And it's like, it has to get the certain work done.
2501200	2504720	Living on earth produces a byproduct called rants.
2506800	2508240	I think you'd find stuff to rant about.
2508880	2511440	Well, at first I'd be like, but mostly it'd be me.
2511440	2513280	I'd be like, why didn't I bring a bottle opener?
2513280	2513440	Yeah.
2514080	2515040	I'm such a dick.
2515040	2516080	I'm such a dumb dick.
2516080	2517520	And I'd be like, you know.
2517520	2520240	You can rant at my little fancy VIP moon.
2521600	2523040	Phoenixville orbits you.
2524160	2525520	It's going to orbit four times a day too.
2525520	2526400	So you see more of me.
2528080	2529280	We're all going to, we're all going to go buy.
2529280	2531600	We're all going to be, we're all going to be at the Mexican restaurant mooning you.
2532880	2533840	There were a couple of people.
2533840	2536560	I went into the Harmontown subreddit and there were a couple of people that were
2536560	2541680	really taking me to task or taking my idea to task as if I had somehow like
2541680	2546160	implied that they should go to the moon with me, which they, which I did not.
2547440	2550000	And they're, and they're like, yeah, it seems a little hypocritical.
2550000	2552720	If you hate capitalism so much, why doesn't you give up his big house?
2552720	2555520	Like, like you were instigating that bullshit that you started.
2563120	2566000	Which is just, I do want to address that point.
2566000	2569120	And I did in the subreddit as well with a little, a little typey rant, but
2571200	2575600	it's okay to have a big house and know that capitalism is a flawed system.
2575600	2579680	Like, like the idea that you could respond to somebody questioning the world that you're in
2579680	2584880	by telling them to, uh, that you don't give them any credit because they haven't yet reduced
2584880	2590160	themselves to a criminal level of poverty, uh, is this is exactly the same as saying,
2590160	2591040	go fuck yourself.
2591840	2593520	There's no difference between that.
2593520	2597920	Like cat, we are all within capitalism when we all survive within capitalism
2597920	2599680	by buying and selling things.
2599680	2600640	I don't think it matters.
2600640	2605200	Like, like, like, like my big house is me going like, this is what I deserve.
2605200	2609440	I'm going to work this hard and make, and, and, and so I can have this much space to move in.
2609440	2613120	I can walk around that space and go, Jesus Christ, what a fucked up system
2613120	2619200	that made me work that hard for this much space, you know, and want to go to the moon
2619200	2624640	and live in a little cubicle, but where there is no such thing as property and hierarchy.
2624640	2627680	We'll go up there and we're, and we're going to have a good time,
2627680	2630880	but it's not going to be, it's not going to be any of these people that question me on Reddit.
2632720	2637200	It's going to be, there's going to be a special detector, uh, that zaps those people.
2638160	2641520	So it gets, it gets more autocratic every time you talk about it.
2641520	2643200	Only, only at the gateway, man.
2643200	2645440	And it's like, that's the other thing that you and Camille were called.
2645440	2646800	Gateways are gateways, man.
2646800	2649120	Yeah, but, but so you got to affect the change.
2649120	2651200	You got, you got 7 billion people on earth.
2651200	2652320	They got a system.
2652320	2655360	You're allowed to say, okay, we got to take the right people.
2655360	2659600	We got to engage in some elitism because we're not going to take 7 billion people to the moon.
2660160	2664400	And even if we could, that would just be like, then keep them on earth and fix the earth.
2664400	2667200	The idea is that, okay, systems too big.
2668240	2671040	Most of the people down here feel like they're nailing it.
2671040	2674560	Even the people who don't are like, well, no, I don't want to go to the moon.
2674560	2678560	Some people would be willing to go, but you got to pick the right ones to take your best shot
2678560	2681200	at starting over in a, in a, in a right way.
2681200	2685440	So yes, you are engaging in de facto hierarchy and elitism because somebody's got to actually
2685440	2691200	start the thing, but the goal is to get up there and, uh, and, uh, you know, uh,
2691200	2693600	hand over the reins to the collective.
2693760	2694800	I promise I will.
2694800	2698720	Did we decide that there was going to be a dome situation or we're going to terraform it?
2698720	2699600	How are we going to live up there?
2699600	2700880	Well, I don't know how to terraform.
2702880	2705920	I kind of feel like we should take somebody who knows how to do it.
2705920	2706160	Yeah.
2709360	2711840	I, I, I'm, I'm, I'm looking at it this way.
2711840	2716080	Like, I don't think I, like, I'm not going to give myself credit for knowing how to grow
2716080	2719040	stuff on the moon, like, like make, make an atmosphere.
2720000	2723440	But I, I've gone swimming with like goggles and stuff.
2723440	2726560	So I, I understand the basic principles of sealing things off.
2727600	2734320	Like, so I figure, and, and, and, and, and we have, we have yet, we have yet to terraform.
2734320	2736080	I think you're, you're a little cocky on that.
2738000	2741360	I'm just saying a lot more credit scientifically than maybe I think,
2741360	2745600	I think it's fair to say that if you can figure out how to live under water,
2745600	2748480	you can figure out how to live on the moon and that's how they train the astronauts.
2748720	2749440	Yeah.
2749440	2752960	So because, because both places are, I have the identical problem.
2752960	2754000	They need to be airtight.
2754640	2755200	Right?
2755200	2756880	So we've accomplished both of those things.
2756880	2758640	We have not terraformed anything yet.
2758640	2762640	So I'm just saying like, okay, we've got to, we've gotten to the moon and we've,
2762640	2764640	and we've, and we've hung out up there.
2764640	2768880	So I'm saying, can I please get up there and hang out there so that people leave me alone?
2770320	2771200	Okay.
2771200	2774320	There will have to be like hydroponic, you know, like,
2775040	2780000	basil gardens and so I can, you know, garnish.
2780000	2780880	We'll get Levi on that.
2782640	2784960	Levi's special carcass fertilizer.
2786800	2787120	All right.
2787120	2788160	One more question.
2788160	2789440	That'll end this segment.
2789440	2789760	All right.
2789760	2790480	Sir, are you there?
2791600	2794480	What's the worst insult anybody's ever said to your face?
2794480	2796880	Worst insult anyone's ever said to my face.
2797520	2798480	That's a good question.
2799680	2800640	I don't want to get it wrong.
2800640	2801280	Like, I don't want to.
2801280	2812640	I remember, I remember being really hurt when I was like in my twenties.
2813760	2820240	And I just, I was, I was, I was helping this, this, this, this band load into this bar.
2820240	2822560	Like it'll take too long to explain why.
2822560	2826880	But and then they were having trouble with like this bouncer or something.
2827520	2834400	And the, I just made some comment, but I was, I was actually trying to ease the tension between
2834400	2834640	them.
2834640	2837440	Like the leader of the band was having trouble with the bouncer.
2837440	2840880	Like there's some misunderstanding about when, if they were going to get paid or if they were
2840880	2842240	taking the door or something.
2842240	2846000	And I just, I just tried to like, like make a funny joke while I was like carrying somebody's
2846720	2848240	bass chords or something.
2848240	2850800	And I was like, hey, yeah, come on guys, don't fight.
2850800	2852400	And then the bouncer looked at me and was like,
2854160	2855600	now you want to start something Chewbacca?
2857760	2863120	It didn't really hurt my, my, my, I just, and I, I think it's about intent.
2863120	2867680	Like, I think I really felt his like complete disdain because who, it's okay to be called
2867680	2868320	Chewbacca.
2868320	2873360	I just, I, but I think at the time I was like, like, like, like, it was like a weird, like,
2873360	2876400	I probably had an image in my head, like, I look like John Kuzak.
2879360	2885120	And he was like, no, I, when I look at you, like with my tiny bouncer brain and improv skills,
2885760	2889840	like I immediately say Chewbacca and I'm not a Star Wars fan.
2889840	2890960	Like I'm a bouncer.
2890960	2892800	Like, so I, like, it's profound.
2892800	2894000	Like you are Chewbacca.
2894000	2894720	Yeah.
2894720	2896560	In other words, it means you're gross.
2896560	2902640	Like kind of like, I just see hair and, and, and like animal, like, like, like,
2902640	2905680	so I felt, I felt, I remember that sticks out in my head.
2905680	2908640	When I was in college, my friend, my friend wrote an article for some magazine,
2909520	2913440	his theory being that Chewbacca was the only Latino in the Star Wars movies.
2914160	2917120	Yeah, because his name is Chewie, which is short for like Jesus.
2918480	2919520	He's a mechanic.
2919520	2923040	And these were his, these, these were his, and he's, and he's, he's Mexican.
2924160	2925680	This is my friend, Andres Soto.
2925680	2929520	He said he's Mexican and, and he never fights alone.
2931520	2933520	And he does, he does kind of have like a little mustache.
2933520	2937040	He does have like, but also no joke, if you watch the first one,
2938080	2942720	A New Hope, when the first time they get into the Millennium Falcon, they sit down,
2942720	2943280	no shit.
2943280	2945360	There are gold dice or silver dice.
2945360	2946000	There are debt.
2946000	2949040	Like there are dashboard dice and you'd never see them again.
2949040	2950880	He bumps his head on them when he gets in the first time.
2950880	2951600	That's the only time.
2951600	2951840	Yeah.
2951840	2957440	It's that, I mean, we saw the, the, the George Lucas unchecked in the Phantom
2957440	2960560	Menace and the fucking like ethnic aliens started rolling out.
2960560	2963920	Like, like every, every planet you went to, I was like, Oh, hello.
2965760	2967920	Welcome to a chine nidia.
2972960	2974960	Oh, this is so expensive.
2974960	2976000	Yeah.
2976000	2976240	Yeah.
2976240	2977920	Could you know where we can get our car fixed?
2977920	2979440	I don't know what's in it for me.
2984000	2985200	I mean, we all saw it.
2987280	2990800	That movie as a great proof would say, cause he was in it.
2990800	2994000	He goes P user to quote, to quote Jar Jar.
2995680	2997120	But there's gotta be something better.
2997120	2999440	Like somebody must've called me something way worse than that.
2999440	3004880	Like, uh, any like, you know, not to name them, but like any like angry studio
3004880	3006960	heads or coworkers and things like that.
3008000	3010880	I mean, they don't, you know, they're, they're, they don't, they don't do that stuff.
3010880	3014400	They just, uh, they just call human resources.
3015200	3018320	If you could conjure up, what would be the most painful thing for someone to say to you?
3019440	3020480	It would center around.
3020480	3026480	Like, like I have a big soft spot or a hot or sensitive button about pretentiousness.
3026480	3028240	Like, who do you think you are?
3028320	3028880	That area.
3028880	3034000	Cause I'm from Wisconsin and I grew up with, uh, like, uh, a brother that was like five
3034000	3038400	years older than me and was constantly like, he would, he would go like, like, like,
3038400	3040640	what the fuck doesn't Daniel have to do his laundry?
3040640	3044880	And my mom would, would, would say to my brother, Daniel special, uh,
3044880	3046320	and my brother would go, no, he's not.
3046880	3051760	Uh, and I'd be like, I'm in the room and, and I'm so uncomfortable.
3051760	3053840	They're DR Harmon is right here.
3054000	3054500	Yeah.
3056880	3060400	And so I just like, like, I, I don't, I don't like, I don't like,
3061280	3063600	I had to learn to take compliments over time.
3063600	3066960	Like a, one of my 80 therapists told me at one point, like you should,
3066960	3070240	when you deflect a compliment, that actually insults the person that's giving it to you.
3070240	3072000	I figured that out after a while.
3072000	3075120	People like how to say thank you when someone said you did a good job.
3075120	3078800	But, uh, uh, but I did the thing that still terrifies me.
3078800	3081520	Like, that's why I can't go to the AV club or anything.
3081520	3085040	Like they, they, if I, if I, if I like, like, you know,
3086800	3091600	Dan Harmon's Iron Man costume from comic cons for sale, uh, AV club headline,
3091600	3095840	I know like not to click on that because I know that the reason they're putting that up there
3095840	3099520	is simply so that like everyone will come there and like leave comments and go,
3099520	3103920	uh, who gives a fuck about this fucking fat asshole shit?
3103920	3105040	Fuck asshole.
3106480	3110080	And I, and I, it'll really, it like, I'm still sensitive about that stuff.
3110080	3113760	Cause I, I, well, all my identity is caught up in people's perception of me.
3113760	3117280	So, so like, like, like it's okay for people to think I'm crazy.
3117280	3119440	It's okay for people to think I'm stupid.
3119440	3123920	Uh, it's okay for people to think like all kinds of like, like, like that I'm abusive that I'm,
3123920	3128320	you know, I don't, I don't want, I don't want them to think that I'm, uh, uh, a bad person.
3128320	3136880	But, but, but when it gets into like, uh, uh, like, uh, people thinking that I am less
3137840	3144480	blank than I think I am, like it kind of really, it really threatens me because it implies that
3144480	3149280	I'm some kind of, it's sort of like, it's sort of like, like, just like opens the Schrodinger box
3149280	3154880	of my entire identity and goes like this. It's empty. Like, cause the first implication is that
3154880	3159920	I'm a construct of myself. Like, and the second implication is that that construct is like
3159920	3163920	emperor's robes. Like it's, it's not there anymore. Like it really kind of terrifies me.
3164560	3170240	Uh, uh, cause I, cause I, I guess I must believe that's true and not want it to be. So, so like,
3170240	3173920	it's not, it's not like the Chewbacca's or the hay fatties. There was a guy outside the magic
3173920	3182080	castle that really, he really like, uh, I, I guess I accidentally, I, I, I, it was on me.
3182080	3187520	Like he was, there was, it was this, this young guy was like opening the door for all of his, uh,
3188160	3193120	all of his, uh, family. Like his, like, like grandma walked through and his mom walked through
3193120	3198000	and I kind of like darted through the door. Like, it's like, thanks. And, and, and, and then, uh,
3198000	3205840	like he, he, he said something like, uh, like, uh, uh, real classy or, uh, I guess I'm opening
3205840	3209600	the door for everybody. I think that was it. And I, and I, and I just kind of like defensively,
3209600	3216240	cause I, I felt, I, I went like, you're going to be okay. You'll be fine. And then because I said
3216240	3222400	that he was like, he just like fucking he, he, he, he, he, I can't really, he was like, oh, thanks
3222400	3228480	fatty. Uh, at the time I was not really like thinking of myself as a fat person. So again,
3228480	3232560	like the Chewbacca thing, I was like, what a fat, that's the first thing. And then I went and looked
3232560	3237920	in the mirror and it was like, yeah, this giant fucking face, like dripping over my, my, my tux
3237920	3243280	collar. I was wearing a tux cause it was the magic castle. Uh, there was some wedding or something. I
3243280	3247040	care. But I was, yeah, I was like, oh shit, God, that guy really got married to the magic castle.
3248240	3252560	Uh, there was some formal event and then, and then there, and then a thing at the magic castle.
3252560	3259520	Yeah. If you haven't been, don't be, you'll get, you'll get insulted. It's less magical than you
3259520	3267120	think. It's a hurtful castle. Uh, but he was right. I, well, I mean, he was right to, I wasn't,
3267120	3272320	I didn't have my fucking, uh, Emily Post, uh, simulator on. My friends were
3273040	3277440	five people ahead and had already gone through the door. So I was just trying to catch up to them.
3277440	3281600	But in his world, it was like, oh geez, what am I, the door opening for you guy?
3283200	3288720	Uh, and then, and then I was condescending. I should have just said, uh, I am so sorry.
3289280	3298400	Fuck that guy. Uh, but remember that guy, uh, at, uh, Tam O'Shanter? Yeah. Yeah. That guy really,
3298400	3301840	really got me. What we were talking too loud or using salty language or something like that?
3301840	3305760	I don't like being told shut up. Like, like, like, like, like, like, I mean, sometimes that'll just
3305760	3310560	make me angry, but, but like also just the idea that I talk too much, that I'm a loud mouth.
3310560	3315040	What was the exchange? He came, a representative from his table came over, right? Or did,
3315120	3319280	knows him. He sat there the whole time. We, Jeff and I were having a good time. I think we told
3319280	3323760	this story on this podcast, but what haven't we told? Uh, we were sitting there in this restaurant
3323760	3328240	and kind of having a couple of beers a summer, summer day, like just out with some friends and
3328240	3333600	like, like just kind of live in the, live in the summer life, like, like, uh, in this quasi fancy
3333600	3339200	restaurant in Las Feliz. And, uh, uh, and there was this table with this guy and these two elderly
3339200	3344480	women and he kept, he, he like, like, like one of them, one of them looked over, I think at one
3344480	3348480	point, which is why I made sure that we weren't really being that obnoxious at a certain point.
3349120	3354320	But I guess we were, I guess we use profanity sometimes when we, when we could be telling
3354320	3360400	like a loud story that might've gotten a little over. And the guy waited the whole lunch instead
3360400	3364480	of just like, like going, like, if this is your demand, like, Hey, we have demands over here.
3364480	3372080	Like you're, you're encroaching on our ability to eat our toad in the hole or whatever. Um,
3372080	3377040	he waited the whole thing, settled the whole bill and then, and then stopped on the way out and went,
3377040	3381200	uh, to the three of us said, Hey, if you guys are going to talk like you're in a truck stop,
3381200	3387200	why don't you go eat in one? And, uh, and then, and then kept walking. And then I, I blurted out
3387200	3392720	because I got so flustered. This is me at my, at my wittiest when I'm actually under the gun.
3392720	3396960	I went, Hey, if you're going to tell people what to do, I should go back to Germany.
3404000	3408560	To which he replied, you go fuck yourself. Yeah. And I was like,
3408560	3414240	Chuck stop. Chuck stop. He just, he just, he was mad. He couldn't talk like a truck stop.
3414240	3418720	Yeah. Yeah. Cause he's clearly like under the thumb of his like mom's inheritance or something.
3418880	3425200	Like who eats with two, two old ladies. If I recall the next two hours to maybe three days,
3425200	3429760	was bed with the esprit de scalia coming up with the perfect returns for that guy.
3431920	3436560	People in restaurants, like, oh, like, like I can't, you know, in LA, when you go to these
3436560	3440960	restaurants and they, and they go, can we get a table for two? And they, and they're like, yeah,
3440960	3446560	of course we can. When the answer is no, they can't because their restaurant is five feet wide.
3446640	3451120	They should just say, no, we can't seat you. And you know what? We have too many tables in here.
3451120	3454960	We should get rid of a couple. So it's a comfortable place. Instead, they fucking
3454960	3464320	jam these goddamn Logan's run fucking, uh, tables together as if, as if it is as human at all to eat
3464320	3470080	closer to a stranger than the person that you came to dinner with the insanity of these play.
3470960	3476240	You go. And then the thing that's even more insane than that is when they sit you in these places.
3476560	3484080	And the thing that blows my fucking mind is the, is when the people next to you
3484800	3491600	who are in the same horrible situation can't have the fucking like human, uh, righteousness to go,
3491600	3496560	oh, I guess we're all just prisoners of war in this, in this shitty place. Let's, let's all, uh,
3496560	3502080	rise above it by ignoring each other. This is the, when the people next to you, like, so you're
3502080	3505920	talking to your friend, you're having an intimate conversation. I'm a hyperbolic guy.
3505920	3510480	I might, I might compare, uh, seasons of TV shows to unsavory things.
3514560	3520880	I'll grab my God given word power to make my point. Uh, I won't do it loudly. I won't, but I,
3520880	3524960	but I'll do it effectively. And then, and there's like a certain combination of words. And then
3524960	3528960	every fucking time I eat in one of these places where you're close to start, somebody always
3528960	3534640	looks over and goes like, uh, uh, that's actually, uh, really, uh, they're not really offensive,
3534720	3540080	but like this, they'll just go like, oh, excuse me. Uh, I, I, I did improv for years. Uh, uh,
3540080	3544560	I was in, uh, you see, what was I, what you said, you said, uh, improv was, uh, you know,
3544560	3548400	bullshit. I said, I said, I was in a bullshit improv troop when I was like, what the fuck am
3548400	3559840	I talking to you for? I mean, what the fuck are you out of your mind? Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Was I
3559840	3569520	rude to you? What are you doing? I'm eating and talking to my friend. You're, what are you doing?
3570800	3576560	I, I, I was at, I was at a date with a girl at, at a fancy restaurant and we were, we were, it was
3576560	3581120	like a first or second date and we were exchanging like philosophies. We were getting to know each
3581120	3587200	other philosophically, uh, spiritually. Uh, uh, you know, she was an atheist. It turned out and I,
3587280	3591360	I was like, I was like, well, I didn't, you know, I'm not, I would never bother to commit to that,
3591360	3596480	that club. And I, uh, but I understand and she, she's like, yeah, I understand people need,
3596480	3601360	people need religion sometimes to, uh, you know, it gives them meaning in that whole thing. I'm like,
3601360	3607360	well, there is that, that, that, that kind of aspect of it. I think that religion connects
3607360	3613840	people with, uh, with the unknown and that's the primary thing, but it has come to be, uh, sort of
3613840	3619680	a crutch for some people, I guess to, to, to, to put it very basically like, uh, you know, uh, uh,
3619680	3625120	you know, uh, this, this, this sort of background notion in our heads that if you get cancer,
3625120	3629040	it's your fault or something like that. And I, it's just like, and I, and I kept talking and then
3629040	3634480	this woman over here, it was like, like I saw her head cock. So now I, now I'm now I'm now,
3634480	3638880	and then she starts leaning into her friend. So these two elderly women and, uh, and then I keep
3638880	3643680	talking to my date. Now, now I have to put 20% of my attention on the lady next to me because
3643760	3651600	she leans over to her friend. She goes, did you hear what he said? And the other woman, and my
3651600	3657840	date is, has no idea that I'm now listening to them and I'm just going, uh-huh, uh-huh, and,
3657840	3664160	and listening to them. And then the other woman goes, no, what did he say? So anyways, I, when I
3664160	3669680	got my master's degree, I just decided I wanted to focus on, uh, he said, if you get cancer, it's
3669680	3678880	your fault. So, so I'm hearing this, I'm horrified that I'm hearing this and I, and I, and so I'm
3678880	3682960	on the date and the person is expressing himself and getting to, getting to know me. And I, and I
3682960	3688160	go, uh, yeah, I was like, excuse me for a second. Uh, I, I, I, I'm sorry. That's not what I said. Uh,
3689680	3695360	and the look on the woman's face, the, at this, at this barbaric
3695360	3704160	act, uh, action on my part, I actually, I, that I was, she was like, I beg your pardon? Chewbacca?
3708000	3714080	I said, I, I, I, I, I overheard, I can hear you talking about what I was talking about and you're,
3714080	3721200	you quoted me out of context and, uh, little did I know that would be the story of my life, but I, I,
3722160	3727440	I, I just like, like you, you, I didn't, I didn't, I was talking about religion with my friend. It was
3727440	3733360	using, uh, hyperbolic, uh, metaphors and things. And you, you, you, you, I didn't, I don't, I don't
3733360	3738560	think it's people's fault when they get cancer. And she's like, oh, well, I, I, I didn't, uh, I
3738560	3744080	didn't know that you could hear me. And I was like, well, uh, you know, it's a, I didn't, I didn't want
3744080	3749280	you to hear me. It's a, it's a very small restaurant. They seat people very close. I guess there's a
3749280	3757440	financial reason behind that. Uh, uh, but we are both the victims and, uh, well, I, I, I survived
3757440	3762800	cancer and I, well, again, okay. So, I mean, this is very inconvenient for all of us. Like I,
3766080	3770400	I'm on a, I'm on a date. That's not surviving cancer, but it's also like, uh,
3771440	3775680	it's also a thing that I want to be hooked into, you know, and like, like, like, like,
3775680	3781920	have you guys met, uh, uh, like, like, why don't I just shove the tables together? And it says,
3781920	3788080	it was a fucking nightmare. It happens every time I go out to eat. If, unless I do the thing that
3788080	3793200	I've learned to do, which makes me a curmudgeon and a, and a, and not as fun to go out to eat with,
3793200	3799600	I walk into a restaurant. If that is the situation, I go, no, we're not eating here. And now my
3799600	3805360	problems are over, but I, uh, I don't know why I'm telling you this. I was at a restaurant
3805360	3809280	years ago, um, as an Italian restaurant was sitting at a little outdoor sidewalk area,
3809280	3813920	having dinner by myself and which I like to do. And, uh, I was sitting there and there's a couple
3813920	3817760	on a first date or not a first date, but there are a young couple dating and they were talking.
3817760	3819920	I, you know, it was very close together. I could hear every word they're saying,
3819920	3825760	because like I have ears on that side of my head and the, and, uh, I have multiple ears and, uh,
3825760	3829680	and they were talking just regular, you know, just chitchat. And then another couple
3830480	3835760	walks into the restaurant that they know. And the, the woman, the young girl goes,
3835760	3841520	young lady goes up, oh my God, like so-and-so like, oh my God, what are you doing? I know.
3841520	3845520	I, I never come here. It's so ironic that you're here. I got coincidence.
3850880	3855440	Actually, I think it was, it was close enough that I actually kind of did the incredibly
3855440	3861600	me thing of the hand on their table. Coincidence. Like, I think I actually had like my fork in my
3861600	3868720	mouth, like, and the guy goes, whoa, whoa, whoa. The guy that was the date was just like, whoa,
3868720	3875520	whoa, whoa, whoa. I go, I go, it's not, it's not ironic. Like, bro, that's not cool. It's like,
3875520	3878800	I'm sitting right here, man. Like, like, like, if you've got problems about that,
3878800	3883760	like get your fucking ducks in a row, man. And then the other couple came up like,
3883760	3886720	they thought we knew each other because it seemed like we were old pals. And I was like,
3886720	3892320	I'm not going to fucking be bashful about that at all. Like, and I completely sunk their dates.
3892320	3898480	It was the best. Well, I know that makes me an asshole, but fucking, I think I said this before,
3898480	3903040	like, if you are watching sports or if you're watching news where they're improvising, like,
3903040	3906400	there's a high speed chase where they're going off prompter and they're having to riff.
3906960	3912400	If you hear the word, you know, I, it's ironic. 100% chance there's going to be no irony and the
3912400	3919680	pursuant sentences and it drives me fucking mad. All right. Well, I mean, I'm a victim in,
3919680	3922880	in my restaurant stories. I know.
3925920	3928320	I'm more of a victim. I have to sit around you people.
3931200	3933280	All right. Well, let's, uh, you shoe wearers.
3935120	3938480	Let's, why don't we bring up, uh, Aaron McGathey, uh, so that we can,
3942400	3950320	Aaron. Oh, she's probably peeing or something. If I know her, she's taking a shit. We're both
3950320	3953920	cleansing. She's probably in the bathroom. Let's bring up Spencer Crittenden instead. Spencer
3953920	3968320	Crittenden. Aaron's taking a poo. She's down in the toilet doing what ladies sometimes have to do.
3968320	3980480	Hello. Sorry. Uh, cleanse, having to pee constantly. Yeah. Yeah. I, um, I'm not drinking
3980480	3985840	a lot of water on this cleanse. Oh, you should. Well, when I do, I have to pee every seven minutes.
3985840	3991040	Yeah. And it's, it really is actually getting in the way of work. I'm not kidding. Like I,
3991040	3995520	so I actually just go, okay, I'll just be a little more dehydrated and just have the liquid kale
3996480	4000880	thing. Well, that's, it's mostly water. So I think you're okay. Health-wise,
4000880	4006400	it's exciting to talk to. I haven't seen you really. So I feel very like this butterfly.
4009680	4013120	It's like a date. Uh, I hope no one overhears our conversation.
4016400	4024000	Coincidence. Spencer, how are you? I'm good. And I'm also getting adequate hydration.
4026480	4031440	How do you, how do you, how are you liking being my assistant? It's good. I, I, I feel like I'm
4031440	4037040	doing a terrible job, but I think I'm doing okay. Um, how would you grade his performance thus far,
4037040	4043840	Dan? Uh, uh, a plus, I guess. I mean, yeah, what I mean, anything lower would be to imply that I
4043840	4048080	needed something that I wasn't getting. And if I needed something, I'd, I'd ask you for it because
4048080	4053200	you paid to get it for me. Sounds like you could use a, like a piss boy. Someone could wrangle your
4053200	4064400	pee for you. Oh yeah. We could figure it out. I got zip ties. If you want to, if you, if you,
4064400	4072000	if you want to do something to make yourself feel like a better assistant. Uh-huh. Here we go.
4074080	4078800	Well, no, this is something that I, I feel bad asking an assistant to do.
4079440	4088640	But now that it's, it's disguised as entertainment, but, uh, like I, I can't because I, I, I just,
4088640	4095280	like my car is, uh, like the inside of it, the passenger side floor is just, it's just garbage.
4095280	4100960	It's just a garbage can. So it can all go? Uh, well, I mean, I think there might be a couple
4101760	4107520	Dungeons and Dragons books down there or something. Save the books. Yeah. All right. You know,
4107840	4114480	close to probably, right? You save the clothes. Okay. Um, uh, uh, what, what should we play a
4114480	4119840	hefty, uh, hearty, uh, uh, uh, round of Dungeons and Dragons? Let's do it.
4124000	4125680	Uh, I listened to last week's show
4129680	4136400	and, uh, I was, I was right. I was playing it, um, in, in a room and like picking things up. And I,
4136480	4143680	I jaw draft at the, at the show to the extent that I walked, I walked over to the mirror and to like
4143680	4151120	witness my own expression on my face. Uh, I was, it was a great show. Yeah. See how fun.
4152080	4156560	See how fun it is. Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm glad we got a lot of, I'm glad we got a lot of our
4156560	4161200	systems. We had our show. I mean, I was, I was gushing about it earlier. I loved it. It was so,
4161200	4165200	it was really, it was really fun to listen to and the, I love the skeletons and the,
4165200	4172000	and I love it. It was great. You guys did great. Anatoly sounded very sad to be playing my character.
4173200	4177200	Yeah. Anatoly, what was up that last week? Were you a little, you were a little out of it.
4177200	4183760	I was a little sleepy because like, I, I, I'm going to rock a horror show,
4184480	4187680	to a rocky horror show, like every week. It's on Sunday night.
4187680	4191760	You're going to record a show? A rocky horror show. A rocky horror show. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4191920	4198320	So like I'm back at home, like at four. Are you in, are you in the rocking? No, I know. I just,
4198320	4203760	you just go. Yeah. You go to the rocky horror picture show every week. Yeah. People get up
4203760	4213920	and do all the crazy stuff. Yeah. Did you have that in Russia? Nope. No, just I, I, I, I like this
4213920	4220560	movie. Like I, I was on in France and in London, at least I, and stuff like that. So like,
4220560	4229920	I really love it. So like, yeah, I pick home like at four a.m. So it is like last Sunday,
4229920	4237760	like I was up at eight a.m. And I decided that I want to go to farmer's market to Santa Monica
4237760	4244080	again, like to have some bus and to house back. So like I, I went there and then I come home. So
4245040	4253600	it was around, I don't like two or three p.m. So I just fell asleep and come to Herman town.
4255280	4257040	That's where I was. Now I'm drowsy.
4259840	4264800	All right. I have Aaron or Mike back, for God's sake. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,
4264800	4273920	Anatoly. Thank you. Thank you for playing. You did a, you did a good job. I discovered
4273920	4277840	Rocky Horror when I was in high school. It was a big, that was a big turning point for me,
4277840	4282800	getting out of the little suburban house and going downtown Milwaukee and Saturday night,
4282800	4291520	getting my curfew extended, seeing people like be gay and stuff. What character did you want to play?
4292320	4295840	I never, I was terrified of the prospect. But if you had to, like, was there one that you're like,
4295840	4301120	I could, that guy. Well, I would have been, I would have been anybody that wasn't like as
4301120	4307440	flamboyant or a cross dressy because I probably was like suppressing like, like this is like my,
4307440	4312960	my friend in high school, like he ended up joining the show and I was always like, what the fuck?
4312960	4317360	Like, like, like, that's insane. I mean, I was just like, like, like I was, I was, you know,
4317440	4322320	16, 17 years old and I would like, I'd never, I don't even think I had like smoked pot or
4322320	4327280	anything by that time. And it's like maybe, you know, drank, drank beers and stuff in basements.
4327280	4332480	But these, these were grownups and like crazy people and it was downtown and
4333600	4338320	God knows what they would get up to at their apartments or backstage. Like, I just remember
4338320	4343600	looking at them as if they were like these crazy, they might as well have been Prince or Boy George
4344240	4350640	like David Copperfield. I had a really, I only went to it once. I had a really bad experience
4350640	4354240	with it. I was with Matt Gorley and some friends in Santa Barbara or something. We were like, oh,
4354240	4357680	let's go see that movie. We didn't know that there was a big, you know, to do and people
4357680	4361200	put on the show and there's all this interaction and stuff. But when we found out, oh, this is,
4361200	4365200	this is cool. This is weird. And, but there was a thing when they asked, like, there was a, there
4365200	4371600	was a couple of really dodgy, not to be mean, but just to describe them, some really creepy
4372560	4377680	frail, syphilitic old Queens that were running it. And they're like, are there any virgins out there?
4378640	4384640	And I was like, yeah, it's like, like a lot of people hadn't had, they were virgins to Rocky
4384640	4389760	Horror, but they didn't raise their hands. I did. And I was taken up on stage, like, like
4389760	4395040	Feyre and King Kong and they, and all of, all of the men and they're a little, like, they're
4395040	4400880	little speedos and they're a little like dingy, sweaty, like, like not been washed ever,
4400880	4406160	like spandex and like lingerie and like, like hairy legs with garters and stockings on.
4406160	4411520	They all stood with their legs apart, like in a line. And I had to lay down, like I was laid
4411520	4415520	down on the stage and my arms out and my feet obviously out. And they all straddled me like
4415520	4419280	three or four or five of these guys. And then two other guys picked, picked me up by the hands and
4419280	4426480	feet and just like rammed me up into their dicks and balls. Just like kind of just like, just like,
4426480	4432880	just, just, just old syphilitic cock and balls and ass. And that's not an origin story.
4435840	4438080	That's how, that's how he got his psychic powers.
4439600	4441920	He went home and there was a suit hanging in his closet.
4443920	4446880	I think there's a way to do that and make it fun for the guy that's getting it done.
4447520	4452720	There was a, there was a, that really was like, it was a big threshold though, because it was,
4453280	4456720	I mean, there was, there was a lot of that going on. I think every company that does
4456720	4460960	Rocky Horror, that's like part of their function ceremonially, you know, there was the guy that
4460960	4468000	plays Frank and Furtor, you know, is, is, you know, is going to be this big flamboyant,
4468000	4473920	like, like covered in makeup, fishnets, like, like, like outgoing, like dude who's like
4473920	4478720	challenging your sexuality while you're in line and then like dragging people up. And
4478720	4484640	the whole company is like, man, I'm on the fringe. And this is like the East side fucking art town.
4486080	4492160	And the terror, like, and then the most important thing, like going through those moments and,
4492160	4498160	and, and being afraid of like what might happen and then realizing like any haunted house or
4498160	4503600	anything that physical contact with people that don't do the same things you do or dress the same
4503600	4508560	way you do, doesn't actually, there's nothing, you know, it doesn't, you wake up the next morning
4508560	4512480	and now you're just cooler. You're not, nothing happened. You're not, you're not gay or you're
4512480	4517120	not, unless you want to be, you're not, you're not, you're in full control of everything the
4517120	4522400	whole time. Like nobody has needles in their hands. Nobody. These guys are pretty scary.
4524160	4530640	It was touch and go. A lot of touch, heavy on the touch. But I was like, I remember walking
4530640	4535280	down the halls of my high school, you know, the following Mondays, like, and just feeling like
4535280	4540320	I had graduated something. And I was, I was, it was like, I bet my posture changed a little bit.
4540320	4547440	Somehow it changed back in the intro, but it was a valuable service provided at the local downtown
4548160	4552800	independent movie theaters in our little small towns. There's little, little kids like me.
4553600	4558400	You get a, where are you going to go to see a Tarantino movie back before Tarantino was
4558400	4567040	an Oscar winner and stuff. But, but thank God. Did you add, were you caught up as a, as a virgin?
4567040	4575760	Did you do that Anatoly? Every, every answer to every question is so sleepy and sad.
4578400	4585760	No. All right. It's also, it's also weird too now to think that you can get,
4585760	4588720	probably get on YouTube and just watch Rocky Horror Picture Show. I'm sure you can certainly
4588720	4592000	get on DVD. Back then it was like the big, the first question that people would have,
4592000	4596080	because they're like, you go in and you yell out stuff on cue. It was always like the idea that
4596080	4601600	there was such a thing as a script for the movie or, or a copy of it that you could watch and
4601600	4606560	practice or something that was unheard of. It was such a, it was such a mystical thing.
4606560	4610160	You had to go to this theater to see this movie. Yeah. Whatever. I probably have the same
4610160	4613680	experience that a lot of people do when they go to see Rocky Horror. I thought that like
4613680	4617280	the people that I was seeing it with for the first time had come up with all those
4617920	4621920	things and thought they were all so cool. And I'm sure afterwards, because I do this,
4621920	4625040	if I watch a performance that I really like, I was probably like, that was really clever.
4625040	4629280	Those callbacks were really, really good. But they're, they've been around for years and years.
4629280	4635920	Me and my friends would try to start new stuff. It was kind of a sad. And it's just random stuff.
4635920	4639600	Like we would, we would pick a spot in the movie where we'd just yell out Charlie Brown
4639600	4646480	and see if it took off. Did you get anything? I think we got a couple of nibbles lately,
4646480	4649920	but they're probably just new people who came the previous week and heard Charlie Brown and
4649920	4655200	somehow it's not, you know, nothing ever, nothing ever took off. It was a dumb experiment. 17 years
4655200	4662480	old. All right. All right, Spencer, shall we get this underway? Yeah. All right. Hold on.
4662480	4674080	New sheets. Last time on Harman Town. After bargaining for the life of Sharpie Butzalot
4674720	4681360	from the Fornheim, the frozen city, more specifically the Yarl of Fornheim,
4682320	4685680	you left the city and put on a show in the blizzard.
4685680	4694880	All right. Kill the music. That's all that happened. Spencer, everybody. Short and sweet.
4699280	4704400	Well, a lot's going to happen tonight, my friend. Well, yeah.
4706400	4711920	So you guys are in an icy, icy canyon. You walked in there because it was the only way through.
4712880	4718480	And Mulrane cast resist elements. Yeah. So we're good to go. Yep. All right. So let's press on
4718480	4721520	and keep going through this canyon and see what, see what goes. Do we need someone to play
4721520	4728080	Christopher or should we go without? Whatever you guys want. Dan's making a poopy face. No,
4728080	4732640	you pick somebody I just can't bear to be the picker. Huh? First hand that shot up. Okay.
4734320	4741760	Tyler is going to help us out. Hello. Hello. I was tempted. I saw Levi's hand
4741760	4746160	go up too. That might've been a good way to go too. Either way. Yeah. Hello, Tyler. Welcome.
4746160	4753920	Hey, Leon. All right. So let's, we walked down the canyon. Yeah, you do. What a show.
4757520	4760560	You were kind of light in it. You didn't really, I would have thought when we started that show
4760560	4764080	that you would have really dove in, but you just, you didn't really do anything. She was a wrapped
4764080	4768800	audience member the entire time. I don't know. Yeah. I got really overwhelmed. I was so excited.
4768800	4772640	I got in my head. I had so many things that I wanted to do. And then I just got really sleepy.
4774560	4780080	But it was, it was, well, I sing my first new song since lady in red. I don't even remember.
4780080	4783360	Yeah. Great. I remember it was, what was it called again? What was the title?
4783360	4786960	Jeez. I don't even remember. The song was, it was, it slipped my mind. It was a moment of beauty
4786960	4793040	that just passed and it's gone. Pick it up. Make up the title. Um, uh, the, the daughter of blue,
4793040	4797840	the daughter of blue is a good song. It's a good song. All right. Let's press on.
4797840	4800880	You hear footsteps behind you crunching in the snow.
4801840	4805120	Is that you guys? It's not. That's behind all of us.
4807040	4810080	I'm behind you and I heard it from behind me and I'm, I'm the last one.
4810080	4811360	Is he in the rear? Yeah, I'm in the rear.
4812080	4819200	I turn all the way around. Turning all the way around. You see among the ice and snow,
4820160	4825440	a familiar Noel named Yurch. Yurch. He's like, Hey guys,
4827360	4834160	I kind of disappeared around that frozen city thing, but I'm back. We're going north, right?
4835200	4838080	Oh yeah. Who could forget Yurch? Who could forget?
4841840	4847120	He's the, he's the pee one, right? The one that smells like pee all the time. Oh yeah. Okay. All
4847200	4854720	right. What, what, what species is it? It's a Noel. Oh yeah. P P P Noel. Okay.
4859440	4863440	I'm just saying, you know, I was scouting. You guys are going the wrong way by the way.
4864000	4868800	All right. Were we not supposed to talk to the giants? No. I mean, just in this canyon,
4868800	4873280	you must've got turned around, but I just came back from scouting ahead. They have this big
4873280	4879200	black gate. It's crazy. It's full of demons and shit. So we shouldn't be going towards the black
4879200	4883840	gate. Well, I mean we should, right? We got to kill him. Yeah. Let's go. Let's go to that gate.
4883840	4891680	So we got to be careful. Okay. All right. Um, you guys go ahead. You're not coming. I mean,
4891680	4898560	I'll stay in the back. Okay. I'll be careful. All right. You're right. Yurch. I mean, yeah, it's
4898560	4907200	nice. Just another day. I wonder, I wonder where have you been? I, I, we haven't seen you. I know
4907200	4911600	that you were assigned to follow us and I just haven't seen you in so long. You know, frost giants
4911600	4918320	can stomp on you. I haven't heard. We had no experience with that. Well, yeah. I mean, I
4918320	4924960	wouldn't know that you got stomped on personally, but I'm sure, I'm sure that's true. I want to take
4924960	4934960	a sidebar with my friends. I'll be over here. To the extent that I ever knew Yurch, like I just
4934960	4942080	don't think that this is Yurch acting really weird. Right. Are you saying you think all gnolls look the
4942080	4952160	same? No. Who has good perception? Good perception. Not me. Or some kind of, uh, no, uh, don't, don't
4952160	4957360	want you guys have like, uh, uh, no intention or whatever. Detect intention, sense motive. Thank you.
4958160	4965120	I have zero points in sense motive. I have nine points in it, but zero. I mean, I think I'm a
4965120	4970880	sensitive person. All right. Spencer. I have nine points in sense motive. I can, I can try to see
4970880	4980960	if he's up to anything fancy. He doesn't seem to be up to anything. What'd you roll? I rolled a four.
4982800	4988480	All right. This seems like he's on the level. I don't know. I'm going to cast detect thoughts on him.
4990240	4996960	You detect his thoughts. What's, what's he thinking? These guys sure are looking at me. Strange.
4996960	5012560	What'd you get to try me? I just, it's, it's Yurch. Okay. Yurch, how many demons are at this
5012560	5020240	big black gate? Like seven. And that's on the far side of that is going to be, uh,
5020240	5029040	uh, Admiral Darkstar. We're hoping right behind the gate lies the black keep. All right, guys,
5029040	5032880	we didn't come this far to turn around now. I'm feeling pretty energized from that show.
5033840	5037680	Absolutely. I think, I think, I think group morale spread at an all-time high. It was a great show.
5037680	5043360	It's an all-time high. Let's uh, let's go. That's a nice skeleton army you got by the way. Oh,
5043440	5049840	I forget. Oh yeah, we got those kids too. We're good. We're good. Thank you, Yurch. What, what, what
5049840	5055440	cost? Yeah, what cost is true. Do you think that maybe there's a demand for this show as a run?
5056240	5062080	Yeah, I think it was a one-off. Wasn't our only audience those flying things that were coming?
5062080	5067280	There was some mosquitoes or some gnats that watched it. Yeah. All right. Let's, let's to the
5067280	5075120	gate. Yeah. Do I have Coco? Yeah. I get on Coco. Do you think that uh, uh, Molly, what the hell is
5075120	5079280	your name? We're playing three different D&D games. I'm so confused. I'm Quark. Quark, do you think,
5079280	5085520	could you, would you, do you think you could scout ahead maybe and uh, okay. I'm gonna send
5085520	5091280	Avenger up. Do you maybe want someone who has stealth to go first and check it out? Yeah, he's,
5091280	5095520	he's, he's stealthier than me. He's a rogue. Yeah, yeah. First, I'm gonna send Avenger. Avenger,
5096240	5101280	fly up. I just want to get a distance. I don't want to talk to Yurch about it. Like it's, he's,
5101280	5108240	I think he's high. Uh, and uh, so I'm going to send Avenger to see how far the Black Gates are.
5108240	5113360	You send Avenger up into the sky, but after a moment or two he returns. Uh, he gives you a look
5113360	5118240	that says it's snowing. It's too hard to see from up here. I'm not used to this kind of climate. It's
5118240	5131680	cold. It's a very subtle look. We're richly nuanced. I almost, I almost thought it was gonna
5131680	5137440	be a wrap. A lot of cadence to that. All right. Well, why don't I, why don't you do, why don't
5137440	5143120	why don't you use stealth types to scout ahead? I don't know. I mean, uh, I'll go with you. All right.
5143120	5146800	Just stay a little bit behind there. Christopher and I walk ahead and uh, I have my, my, my sword
5146800	5153120	out, you know, at the ready. The two of you go ahead down this icy canyon and you round an icy
5153120	5159120	bend and you see it. The Black Gate, it, it extends maybe a hundred feet tall and you can see about
5159120	5169360	four levels of catwalks that are kind of strung together by these metal stairs. Standing on the
5169360	5175120	catwalks kind of patrolling around are black armored dudes as well as these beardy demons and
5175120	5181120	devils that you kind of saw and fought with at a yellow camp. How many of them are there? There's
5181120	5188160	seven demons and you count one, two, four human guys, whole armored guys. And then three of the
5188160	5194560	bearded demon types? No, there's seven demons and four guys. Okay. All right. Um, is there, hey,
5194560	5198800	Chris, do you, any reason why we were sent ahead to go do this and the whole crew couldn't come?
5198800	5203040	So that we don't see everybody. I mean, they're patrolling and they, okay. Well, I go back and
5203040	5209920	I report to you guys that I give them the info, the, the recon catwalks, you say catwalks stairs.
5209920	5214560	Yeah. It's kind of like, it's kind of like a stage, a stage production of West side story,
5214560	5219200	you know, it's like, or like, or like rent. It's like a, like a big fire escapee kind of thing.
5220160	5223680	So they've got the high ground. I wonder if there's any way we could get up there so we're
5223680	5228320	not walking under them. Maybe we can pick them off, pick off a couple of them before we fully
5228320	5232720	engage or maybe destroy the stairs and make them make the catwalks fall. We should probably go
5232720	5238400	before our, you know, sizable skeleton army goes forward, maybe pick a couple of them off and then,
5239200	5243280	you know, so they don't have enough time to escape. Then we call, call the cabaret. Yeah. All right.
5243280	5250560	Gentlemen, maybe I can use my, my tree token. I have a tree token. What? Tree token. I have a
5250560	5257120	tree token. What does that do? Tree token. Uh, I, I, if I, if I throw it on the ground, a tree,
5257200	5263760	a tree will grow. Okay. Are we gonna? Tree token. Hide behind the tree. We could climb the tree
5264720	5268800	or, um, I sheepishly take my tree token, put it back in my pocket.
5271200	5276160	I appreciate the effort. What's on the sides of the gate? What's flanking this gate? Well,
5276160	5280240	it's just like wedged into the ice. Oh, into the canyon. There's no way to climb the, the,
5280240	5285200	the walls of the canyon. Not unless you have, uh, climbing spikes. I think that's what they're
5285200	5291840	called, right? Would it be a lame waste of the skeletons to just do the old saunter out there,
5291840	5296880	go, Hey, fuck you guys and run back and just stand behind the skeletons? I mean,
5297440	5302320	all right. Wouldn't they call reinforcements though? If they see a couple of us go, Hey,
5302320	5306240	we're here. Yeah. They might, they might open the gate and bring out a bunch of, uh, there's,
5306240	5310400	we should send more people. He's saying like, like, wave and like, we'll moon them and we'll show
5310400	5313040	them our ass. And then they'll all come. Those, those guys at the gate will just think it's a
5313040	5316640	couple of people and they'll come running and they'll come over there and they'll be the cast
5316640	5321920	of Ben. Her will be there. Right. Well, and we could instruct our skeletons to lie on the ground.
5321920	5327040	Like it's a, like they're fallen soldiers. Maybe someone who has bluff could be like,
5327040	5331120	there's only a couple of us. We're just hanging out having a good time. Yeah. It's just an act.
5331120	5335040	We don't have an army of skeletons over here. I say we just, I say we just advance. I say,
5335040	5341200	I say we just come in there and kick these guys as ass. Yeah. Let's, let's, let's, let's give
5341200	5348160	them everything we got. Let's just come in. I'm that exhausted. Yeah. I've been solving
5348160	5355120	problems all day. I think we'll just, let's just blunt force it. All right. So, uh, so who's
5355120	5362400	taken lead then? I'll, I'll go forward first. I'm on my horse before the skeletons or at the very
5362400	5367200	least, like why don't we just, just one preliminary. Let me, let me just do this. I've always wanted
5367200	5373120	to do this. Let's just walk. Well, I'm just going to walk around the bend and then you go like,
5373120	5375520	Hey, you guys got changed for a dollar.
5379120	5383760	My wife and I, we, uh, need change for a dollar.
5388960	5389920	Also look at this tree.
5392400	5396960	All the guys on the wall kind of like turn towards you and they're looking at you and
5397040	5403040	bearded devils kind of hold out their arms and they start to be wreathed with flames. All right.
5403600	5411920	See, I'll be over here. Bye. And then I retreat like a coward and I walk to behind the skeleton
5411920	5420640	army and I read a book. You hear the crunching of footfalls and then the four armored men are upon
5420640	5425600	you. They've managed to scramble down this gate and chase you guys down to where you guys are.
5425600	5430880	I general the skeleton to do kind of a thermopoly, you know, the Spartan kind of thing of sort of
5430880	5437520	close off the pass, you know. Okay. They seal off the pass, but these guys are approaching.
5437520	5444240	Right. They're going to let them clash. Yeah. That makes sense. Do the demons see the 40
5444240	5447760	skeletons and it's like, fuck it. We're going to keep going. Yeah. You know, okay. They don't
5447760	5452800	give a fuck. They're very confident. They're just demons. What does my power bracelet do?
5453760	5459360	It just gives you plus two strength. It's included on your stat block. Fun rules.
5461520	5467600	All right. You see your skeleton army kind of engage with the enemy. These, these human guys
5467600	5473440	in armor kind of clash and the skeletons are actually really well trained and magical and
5473440	5479680	cool and stuff, but two of them managed to just slice the two of the guys in half. Yeah. And the
5479760	5485120	other three don't manage to do as well. And they just kind of poke out at these armored guys,
5485120	5489200	but only five can get in right now. But then the rest kind of have them surrounded
5489840	5495680	and armored guys see that they're, they're going to lose, but the skeletons aren't, aren't going
5495680	5500160	for the final blow right now. They're just surrounding them. All right. I jump in with
5500160	5507760	my flaming sword and attack the nearest armored guy with your flaming sword. You jump into the
5507760	5519040	fray, but you trip over a femur of one of the skeleton swords. So these guys are alive and are
5519040	5524240	kind of like at the, at the sword points of our skeleton emissaries. The skeletons are kind of
5524240	5537680	waiting. Gentlemen, it looks like you're in a skeleton situation. We can't, we can't use
5537680	5549840	bone voyage again. Uh, tell us how, where's the back door? What? Is there another entrance to
5549840	5558720	the temple? I mean, you're asking me. It's not a temple. The gate, the, the, fuck you guys.
5560640	5568000	Harmon quest ended. Well, we're going to Admiral Darkstar's fortress. Yep.
5569440	5574080	Is there another way in? Oh, the only way is through this gate. Or if you have climbing
5574080	5579840	equipment, you could climb up the canyon and then go around this gate or you could wait for
5579840	5590560	this gate to open. What does it open for? You know, large traffic. We're large traffic. What?
5590560	5597520	Like a bus? Maybe. Bus. Let's keep, let's keep killing these guys. We're just standing around
5597520	5602640	talking. Yeah. I thought maybe they, have we gotten any useful information out of them? They
5602640	5610080	said no, go through the gate. Large traffic. That's arguably useful. All right. The skeletons
5610080	5615840	forward. Are you going to kill the guys? Large traffic. Yeah. Often can we like a wait and like
5615840	5618960	hitch a ride, like behind a wagon and like sneak our way in that we, I don't think we can sneak an
5618960	5624560	army. You know who waits? Cowards. Fine. Fools. Whatever. I shoot an arrow at a skeleton. Let's
5624560	5631200	kick some ass. Do you sarcastically shoot an arrow at a skeleton? Whatever. Whatever. The skeletons
5631200	5638160	dispatch the remaining guys and you continue on towards the gate. Yeah. Good. Good job, skeletons.
5639360	5644960	As you approach the gate, you hear loud sounds. They sound kind of like what sirens would sound
5644960	5651840	like if you knew what sirens were. Get out of the way. This is definitely magical in nature,
5651840	5658320	but at the same time you see the gate that grows. It doesn't grow. A split kind of develops in its
5658320	5664400	middle and it swings open like a giant door and standing in that giant door is one of the largest
5664400	5671280	ogres you've ever seen, almost 40 feet tall with a small metal platform on his back. And you see
5671280	5679440	kind of dudes standing on this platform on his back holding crossbows as ogre starts lumbering
5679440	5687040	through the gate. He's got a sniper perch on his back. Yeah. We got, let's, let's, let's throw some,
5687280	5693120	let's throw some magic at this guy right off the bat. Yeah. When I, when I get to go, I'll, I'll
5693120	5702000	shoot a fireball at him. You get to go. Fireball. Same with a little more gusto, man. Fireball.
5706800	5711920	All right. Where do you aim it? Like at the guy or at the platformer? I'm aiming it at the,
5711920	5716000	well, would I be able to hit the guys on the platform? Yeah. If you aim towards it,
5716000	5722560	but it would be like away from his center of mass, I guess. Yeah. Well, I'll aim for the platform.
5722560	5730480	Yeah. Okay. That's what I assumed, by the way, for all you podcast listeners. Um, yeah. So you do
5730480	5736720	that. You throw your fireball and it arcs up over the guy's shoulder right onto the metal platform
5736720	5742800	where these snipers are stationed and it explodes and you see, you know, two corpses just fly off.
5742800	5752800	Yeah. The rest of the guys take seven fire damage. Fucking yeah. It's nice. I mean,
5752800	5758800	yeah. How many of them are up on that platform? You don't know because it's such a large platform.
5758800	5762000	I don't have any, uh, ranged weapons. I can't really throw, I can't really get them from a
5762000	5772560	distance. I have a short bow. I can, I can finish them off. I want to see a tree too, you guys.
5772560	5777200	Adam Goldberg suggested this. I'm going to throw it out there. He said, plant the tree under the
5777200	5784080	ogre's nuts and have a tree grow up into it. A tree grow up his butt and the old tree dick manure.
5788560	5790160	That's called the Jolly Roger, isn't it?
5796560	5799200	God, I wish it were 15 minutes later. That would have been at the end of the show.
5802800	5808240	Uh, well, I, um, hmm. All right. Well, how, how close can I get to the ogre?
5808880	5814560	You'd be able to get to where it was standing if you ran. Okay. But not if you walked.
5815920	5823040	Well, I'm on, on Coco. I, I gallop over to the ogre. I look over at, at Sharpie. I give him a,
5823040	5830720	I give him a wink. Something's about to happen. I, uh, I gallop up to the, uh, up to the ogre
5830720	5839200	right between his legs. I, I, I, I, I reach for my quiver for a second and then I'm like, no,
5839200	5847120	no, no, just do this. I take my token and I throw it at the ground between his legs and I say,
5847120	5859360	who's the sap now? I'd like to see, do you die? Maple tree.
5861520	5868160	So I do that. You thrust the tree token into the soft snow and then before your varied eye,
5868160	5872960	very eyes. My various eyes. Before your various sensory organs,
5874480	5882000	a tree springs into being. It grows in girth as well as length as it reaches its final
5882000	5889280	heights, which is somewhere between this, uh, ogre's midsection. It smashes him right through the
5889280	5904080	pelvis. Well done. And he takes 20 damage. I think, I think the, uh, the very clever little,
5904080	5906640	little witty, uh, back braced angel on my shoulder.
5910400	5915840	At the moment he can't, he can't move. His legs are kind of too far from the ground to move at the
5916000	5925840	moment. Awesome. So he's like a popsicle right now. Like, oh, all right. Um, I, can I, who's,
5925840	5931520	who's up? Throw it to Tyler. All right. Uh, let's see. So I want to get, I want to get the rest of
5931520	5934080	these snipers out of the way so we don't worry about them because we can just worry about this
5934080	5938560	big slow ogre. Um, amulet of autumn can become invisible for five rounds twice a day. I want to
5938560	5943440	use that to get behind them so I can pick the rest of the guys off activating your amulet of autumn.
5943440	5950240	You gain invisibility. All right. Uh, you wanted to get behind him? I want to see if I can get kind
5950240	5955360	of behind where the ogre, ogre came out of the gate, right? You can do that. Okay. I'm gonna,
5955360	5961120	I'm gonna get behind him. You do that. All right. And I'm gonna take a, a, a shot with my sharp bow
5961120	5971600	at, uh, one of the remaining guys up there. Yeah. You strike the guy directly in the
5971840	5981600	shoulder. Not directly in the shoulder, indirectly in the shoulder. He takes seven damage. Nice.
5981600	5988880	Did you add the 1d10? Four. It says I get 1d10 damage. Oh yeah. No, thanks for reminding me.
5990640	5994960	Hey man, I don't have to learn all the rules. I'm helping. I'm just telling everyone. That's
5994960	6000640	why it's literally written on the sheets. So I don't have to memorize everything. Anyway,
6000640	6011120	that's an extra seven damage. So I said seven, 14 damage. What's, what's the damage to the, uh,
6011120	6018160	player dungeon master relationship? Uh, I mean the relationship. Moving on.
6023760	6029360	Anyway, who's up? Not the ogre. It's your turn. Um, I take a flaming far sword and swipe at the,
6029680	6034560	at the chest of the ogre. Is the far sword long enough to, uh, to do that? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It's
6034560	6042000	far. Flaming far sword, swipe. Swinging your flaming sword. You unleash a crackling arc, arc,
6042000	6048080	arc, whatever, of windy flaming energy. And it strikes him. Does it? Yeah. It strikes him.
6048800	6052880	Directly in the chest. Yeah. Yeah. The chestal regions.
6053840	6061680	That's one D 10 plus one D six plus four plus four. Yeah. 10 damage. Yeah. Yeah.
6065200	6070640	You're right to applaud that. He seems a little worse for wear. And then, you know, you see a
6070640	6074960	couple of the snipers remaining take their positions at the edge of his thing and they
6074960	6086880	fire down on you with crossbow bolts. Yeah. So Sharpie, you get hit with one of these bolts
6087680	6094400	and as it strikes you, you, you feel caustic burn as acid seeps into your skin. You take
6094400	6101600	five burning damage. You made him make a poopy face. Acid will do that to you.
6102400	6112400	Yeah. The other arrow misses, but then the ogre starts striding towards you. He's off the tree.
6113040	6123440	Uh, yeah. Like he's kind of start striding towards you like that. All right. Yeah. But I mean,
6123440	6128640	it took all that effort to get off. So that's it. That's it. That's his turn. I love it. Did the
6128640	6135600	tree go up his butt or no, it just kind of, you want to be technical. It caught, it caught him
6135600	6142560	right in the tank. Right. There was a bit, there was a bit of like wooden penetration, just not
6142560	6149840	like that. Like, like a thorn getting rammed up to your taint might Pierce break the skin. It was
6149920	6156240	like that. Taint the butt. He's, he's since he's moved past it.
6158800	6163280	But that's like his prostate muscle, right? Yeah. No, he's coming loads.
6168960	6170160	You guys, that's not snow.
6170160	6181280	We just made an ogre come by wrapping a magical tree into his tates. I put that on my resume.
6185040	6189280	Does he get sleepy? No. Does he want to take a little nap? No.
6192240	6193680	Does he want nothing to do with us now?
6193680	6200320	Should we just leave? We could just leave, right?
6204320	6205120	He's pissed.
6205120	6206240	Are you asking about his Felix?
6210240	6211440	Is it Sharpie's turn?
6212880	6217280	Yeah. That's his turn.
6217280	6227360	I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm just going to cast Fireball on
6227360	6232480	this ogre again. Okay. Actually I'm going to, I'm going to cast on that platform. I don't want to
6232480	6236400	get shot with any more arrows. There's still two left up there, right? Yeah. Okay.
6240320	6244880	You throw your Fireball again at wizzes right over the ogre's shoulder before
6244880	6250240	impacting and exploding on the thing. I think it was a platform.
6252560	6259520	You see flaming corpses fall off the side. Two of them. All right. Hell yeah.
6263360	6274640	Clear platform. Roger. All right. I wipe off my face with a rag that's in my pocket.
6274880	6280880	And I, I was standing there. You came on you? I was standing there. I only assumed.
6281760	6284080	He was wearing pants in my mind. Okay.
6286880	6291760	Just come out with a raging boner. I don't understand. I mean,
6291760	6297920	why would he come just because his prostate got pierced? You don't know Ogre Anatomy, man.
6299760	6301440	I want to know more about this ogre's pants.
6301600	6307360	Yeah. What is a smart ogre wearing these days? Well, this is no smart ogre, but
6308640	6315600	I mean, just, just, just standard burlap kind of. Okay. Just now filled with cum.
6316240	6324000	Yeah. You can see it kind of, you know, burlap's not, it's a porous material. Yeah, exactly.
6324000	6327920	I only wipe off my face because it's, it's covered in perspiration because I've been
6327920	6334720	riding my horse. I'm going to, I take out my, my speedy long bow.
6336560	6343920	Yeah. I whip it around in front of me or whatever you call the action of putting it in the position
6343920	6350240	of shooting it. Knock the arrow. Sorry? You knock the arrow. I knock the arrow. I'm going to knock a
6350240	6357040	fiery arrow at the ogre's face. And so I do that.
6360000	6366160	You launch a fiery arrow right in the ogre's face and it strikes right there.
6369440	6377280	Dealing six fire damage. Nice. Nice. Go get him to Berg. All right. So this tree that kind of grew
6377280	6381680	up into him, he hopped off it, but like the tree is still mostly in shape. Oh yeah. Okay. You want
6381680	6386480	to jump on? I kind of want to get on the tree and then leap onto him. Go for it. I want to do that.
6386480	6390400	Let's do that. You're, you're invisible right now, right? I shot an arrow so I broke invisibility,
6390400	6396160	unfortunately. Yeah, every time. Whatever. He's, he's worried. He's worried about you. You shot a
6396160	6399920	fiery arrow in his face and knocked his prostate. So he's like, I'm off to you. You know, he's not
6399920	6406720	worried about me. I follow, follow your heart. You know, you're more analytical this week than
6406720	6410320	you are normally. Just go in, go in there. Strangely. Can we hear a couple of lines with
6410320	6422560	the daughter of blue before you go up there? Her hands are so small. I know. I want to hear
6422560	6429680	the rest of this pot and I want to know if we're learning about Tyler's sexuality. So small.
6430560	6442320	I like to climb the tree. Can we do that? Yeah, you climb the tree. Okay. I'm assuming I'm not
6442320	6447280	going to have any leftover thing to do anything besides climb the tree this round. Well, yeah.
6447280	6453280	I always try to push it. You just take position up on this tree. Can I get ready? Can I, you know,
6453360	6459360	can I get into a fierce crouch with my poison dagger out? Like, well, I'd assume. Okay. How many
6459360	6466960	fierce crouch? Yeah, you are. Yeah. Fiercely crouching in a tree. You wait for your next turn.
6469040	6474400	We're good. I, uh, I run at him and do a power attack with my sword at his, uh, at his like
6474400	6481040	Achilles tendon. Hacking at his Achilles tendon with your flaming sword. You do so.
6483280	6493280	Dealing 12 damage. Yeah. He kind of falls down to one leg. Now he's just lower for him in the
6493280	6497200	tree. Is it that kind of like someone who's back to his head and start stabbing him? Awesome. Yeah,
6497200	6508000	I like it. Yeah. Well, it's his turn. He reaches down and swats at you. Quark who's stabbing at
6508000	6518560	his knees. Achilles tendon. Whatever. Isn't that where those are? I took classes.
6521600	6525440	No, it's a, yeah, I know where that it's in the taint.
6528160	6534080	But yeah, no, he, he, he fumbles around. He, he has a hard time, you know, grabbing at you since
6534080	6541600	you're so tiny. Yeah. And he doesn't. Sweet. He gropes about, but fails. He's got a big load in his
6541600	6549040	drawers. He's got a lot to deal with. He's got a big cut in his chest. He's on fire. He's got a
6549040	6555360	sliced heel. We're sending the most confusing signals right now. Poor guy just had the biggest
6555360	6563920	orgasm of his life. Putting in a Sharpie's turn. Oh, uh, I, uh, I want to, I want to use my arm.
6564880	6570800	No, I don't. I don't want to use my armlet. Can I, can I just cast fireball on his face again?
6572240	6576000	What level are you? No, you only have two level three spells, I think. All right.
6577280	6581280	Sorry, everybody. It's all right. Don't, don't be sorry. It's not you. I want to get out of here
6581280	6590640	just as much as you do. Uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna cast jump and see if I can jump up onto
6590640	6600720	the, uh, uh, ogre just to, just to make, uh, Krista Berg mad. Casting jump. You leap the stride,
6600720	6607920	the ogre right in front of Krista Berg. That's my spot. I'm going to jump there.
6608080	6611120	Stay in your fierce crouch.
6613120	6619600	Is that, is that my move? No, I, yeah. All right. Okay. Um, I, uh, I crouch fiercely.
6621120	6626240	You son of a bitch. Do I, do I have more than one tree token? No, that was it.
6628160	6634000	I know guys, I'm sorry too. Um, oh, is it your turn? I'm sorry. That's okay. Um,
6634000	6643040	I am going to, I'm going to use my, my armlet of summer to heat up metal. Okay. I'm going to
6643040	6649920	heat up the steel that I have in my possession, throw it into my backpack. What steel? You just
6649920	6655360	like have a plate of steel? Yeah. Yeah. For, for striking out, for stoking, starting fires. Okay.
6655360	6663600	Crouch. Um, I heat up the steel. I throw it into my backpack. I create like a, I cut a little
6663600	6673200	part of it. So, and I tie, I tie, it'll get there. I tie my rope to like the strap of the backpack
6673840	6682080	and I create like a, a, a souped up, um, uh, who fought Goliath? David.
6683840	6686160	I, I like a soup. Who fought Goliath?
6686160	6693040	Um, peanut butter and, uh, what do you call it?
6695760	6702000	That's got fruit in it. I, I whip it around my head. Uh,
6703200	6707520	yeah. So like a slingshot exactly, but a souped up slingshot. And when it's in the
6707520	6714000	exact right position, I hurl it at his, at his throat. So I don't hit Sharpie.
6714640	6720000	And the idea being that it's like shrapnel and that the metal, so you, so roll it.
6730880	6736560	So, yeah, no, you, you do that. You whip it up as, as you start whipping it around your head,
6736560	6745280	the backpack starts catching fire. Jesus Christ, you guys. What am I? A monster?
6747280	6751680	And you throw it and it hits him in the throat. What were you expecting?
6752960	6756240	You're in such a feisty mood tonight. I know I'm all over the place.
6756240	6764000	I don't get it. Dealing 11 damage.
6766720	6771280	The ogre clutches at his burning throat. I got to say, I didn't think that was going to work.
6773040	6778080	Just time wise, she accomplishes so much in a turn. It's like watching a PBS show.
6780080	6785360	She makes a rocking chair and then sits in it, makes lemonade, and then invites the,
6785440	6792720	the enemy to drink the lemonade. But then, uh, I guess I'm jealous. I'm jealous.
6794400	6801680	Yeah. He just claws at his throat as it's on fire. That happens. Finish him to Burke. All right.
6801680	6805920	I want to, I'm already fiercely crouching. I want to hop on, I want to hop on this guy. Dan's
6805920	6811360	right where I was going to go. So I try to, I'll go next to him. I'd like to leap onto him. You
6811360	6816480	leap onto him. All right. Is there any way I can get up to where his head is and throw rope down
6816480	6822480	so we can get everyone up and everyone can just be on his head? Yeah. Let's do that. You do that.
6822480	6834320	All right. I climb up the rope and, uh, and I go down his pants. No, no, don't go down there.
6834320	6839120	And I, and I, and I go, and I go up to his dick and balls and I, and I, I use cleave.
6842880	6845360	What's, what's your fortitude? My fortitude.
6846960	6853680	Eight. Do you realize how much ochre you see me and you're going to have to climb through to get
6853680	6861760	to this. It wouldn't be my first time, Chris. It would not be my first time. Seaman slicked slacks.
6864320	6870880	You are overcome by the over coming smell.
6874960	6877600	Did you find yourself too nauseated? Oh no.
6881200	6887440	I just keep sliding down the pant leg until I come out and I do, I do one of those, like, uh,
6887440	6894000	like Laurel and Hardy. You want to, you need to, you need to cut your way out of these
6894000	6898960	pants. He's on one knee. You got to cut your way out of these burlap pants. No, I came down the
6898960	6905520	other one. All right. All right. That was, uh, that did not go as planned, you guys. You should
6905520	6910720	have stayed in his head, man. I didn't expect ochre come to be that, uh, that overwhelming.
6910720	6917040	Lesson learned. Ochre come. Ochre anything is putrid. Live and learn.
6917040	6928080	Yeah. Well, well, indeed. Sharpie, finish this guy. Come on. No. First he punches Sharpie.
6931920	6939200	Isn't Sharpie on him? Sharpie takes 12 damage. Oh, whatever.
6939200	6949120	Uh, I have a thing called the rod of the serpent. What does that do again? It turns into a serpent.
6950640	6959360	There's a time and a place for that. What did somebody yell out? I'm not going to do anything
6959360	6964320	clever. I mean, I'm on his head. I just want to, I'm not a real bladed weapon kind of guy. I'm just
6964320	6967760	looking for a quick guy. Did you climb up when you're on his head with us? Yeah. I'm just going
6967760	6975200	to do, can I do a scorching ray on his, on the back of his head, right where Ving Rayne's
6975200	6985120	Band-Aid would be? Casting your arms in a magical manner. You unleash a blazing scorching ray
6985120	6990880	directly into the, what was that part of his head you mentioned? So where the, where the nape of his
6990880	7002720	neck, right in the nape of his neck and it burns and it burns dealing 16 damage. You can kind of
7002720	7007600	see through all this burn flesh and skin is exposed spinal column and he kind of,
7011040	7012880	is he dead? Yeah, we did.
7016480	7020160	Ladies and gentlemen. Oh, sorry. I got the wrong thing. I got the wrong thing.
7020320	7023680	Keep it rubbing. Thank you for coming to Harman Town.
7027520	7030320	Thank you so much everybody. Thank you, Tyler. Thanks guys.
7032160	7038080	Thank you, Levi, for coming up and Atoli, Adam for the great line, everyone else we spoke to.
7039200	7041200	Erin McGathey. One more time for her, please.
7043520	7045600	Thanks so much. Spencer Crittenden.
7045600	7052080	I'm Jeff Davis. One more time for your mayor, Dan Harman. Thanks Bill. Thanks for the sticks, Bill.
7053360	7058080	And thanks Seek, Seek Donnelly for all of your free comic book stuff that was on your
7058080	7066400	seats when he came in here. And God bless you and we'll see you next week.
