12000	13000	Hello all.
13000	20000	ðŸŽµ
20000	22000	From McCracken Park.
22000	24000	ðŸŽµ
24000	26000	What's the first lyric of that song?
26000	27000	ðŸŽµ
27000	29000	Spring was never waiting for us here.
29000	36000	ðŸŽµ
36000	38000	Now in session everybody!
38000	41000	Let's bring out our Game Master.
41000	43000	Although we don't play games anymore,
43000	45000	but still he's our Game Master.
45000	46000	Spencer Crittenden.
46000	51000	ðŸŽµ
51000	52000	The Wellshorn.
52000	55000	ðŸŽµ
55000	57000	You got a side pony going on right now.
57000	58000	Oh yeah, I need it.
58000	60000	ðŸŽµ
60000	63000	You know what else we need Spencer?
63000	64000	Why?
64000	65000	We need a mayor.
65000	67000	Let's bring out Dan Harmon everybody.
67000	75000	ðŸŽµ
75000	79000	Yo, I got a microphone back on the stage.
79000	81000	It's all the way back.
81000	83000	A deeper mic for a deeper show.
83000	86000	I fucked your mama in her big toe.
86000	88000	Whoa, yeah.
88000	91000	ðŸŽµ
91000	93000	Inside her big toe?
93000	94000	Yeah.
94000	96000	Yeah, well, let me explain.
96000	99000	I'm an orthopedic surgeon.
99000	102000	Your mama was a virgin.
102000	104000	She wanted to stay that way,
104000	108000	so I said come out to my house the next day
108000	110000	that I have off work,
110000	113000	and I'll do a little experiment that I've been wanting to do.
113000	115000	I need you to sign this waiver, girl.
115000	119000	I'm going to be the most famous orthopedist in the world.
119000	121000	I'm going to fuck your toe.
121000	124000	And you're going to get to stay a virgin,
124000	127000	and I'm going to be a famous surgeon.
127000	130000	We're going to be on the cover of...
130000	131000	People.
131000	137000	ðŸŽµ
137000	139000	So your dick was tied to her toe?
139000	143000	Yo, I've got a very small wiener.
143000	146000	You're a...
146000	147000	You're a bikini?
147000	148000	Yeah.
148000	149000	Yeah.
149000	152000	When I was born, the doctor said,
152000	154000	Whoa, I think that's a girl.
154000	157000	My mom said he's going to fuck a toe.
163000	166000	This is the sexiest fucking rapper we've ever done.
166000	169000	I'm a weird surgeon with a tiny penis
169000	171000	that invites women to his house
171000	175000	and puts a hole in their toe and then fucks it.
176000	177000	Wait, wait.
177000	179000	You put a hole inside the toe?
179000	182000	I put a hole inside the toe. We've been over this.
183000	186000	That sounds more invasive than I had.
186000	188000	I had them sign a waiver.
188000	191000	The whole point was the person wanted to fuck
191000	193000	but didn't want to be a non-virgin.
193000	195000	They wanted to retain their virginity,
195000	198000	and so I had a plan that might have some affinity
198000	200000	for people of the kind of persuasion
200000	204000	that doesn't want to lose the hymen
204000	206000	and the props with the God above.
206000	207000	I don't know.
207000	209000	At least she was Catholic, is what I'm saying.
211000	214000	She wanted to maintain her maiden head.
214000	217000	Can I ask you the procedure where you make the hole in the toe?
217000	220000	It's called the toe-pussy-otomy.
224000	227000	And it's smooth and sexy.
228000	230000	Welcome to Hamilton, everybody.
230000	232000	We did it again.
232000	237000	If that wasn't worth coming out on a holiday weekend,
237000	240000	tonight's show is brought to you by Steve Levy,
240000	243000	who forgot to cancel the show.
243000	245000	I was told there was no show tonight.
245000	248000	You were told that by me.
248000	251000	I was told that by Common Sense.
251000	253000	It's a national holiday.
253000	256000	Men and women have fallen for our freedoms.
256000	258000	And yet we have almost a full house right now.
258000	259000	I know.
259000	261000	Well, I guess it turns out to be a good night to do a show.
261000	263000	That's the upshot.
267000	270000	I mean, yeah, since we're all here, we'll make it worth it.
270000	274000	But, you know, I think the fact that we are here is a crime.
275000	277000	And treasonous, really.
277000	279000	These aren't times to be fucking around with the definition
279000	281000	of what it means to be a proper American.
281000	286000	That's a razor-thin high wire that we have to walk every day.
286000	288000	It's a lot of nuance.
288000	291000	What kind of American do you think you are?
291000	296000	I don't mean to be glad, but define your Americanism.
296000	298000	What kind of patriot are you?
301000	304000	Can you give me some categories that exist already?
304000	305000	I don't know.
305000	308000	Are you a cynical patriot?
308000	309000	Yeah.
312000	313000	Well, that was easy.
313000	314000	Yeah.
314000	320000	I mean, you don't have to try to think of things for me to talk about.
320000	326000	I guess the point is that being a patriot right now is complicated.
326000	327000	Oh, yeah.
327000	330000	No, it's like I was saying.
330000	334000	It's incredibly nuanced, incredibly subtle, paradoxical.
334000	338000	I mean, it's just you need a surgeon's touch to...
339000	343000	I didn't want to connect that dot, but...
343000	345000	I didn't say anything.
345000	349000	You're going to make up a hole in a person's toe and fuck it.
349000	350000	Yeah, anyways.
350000	351000	So, yeah.
351000	354000	Well, you know, I was obviously being sarcastic.
354000	360000	You can literally be a semi-literate fucking crazy...
360000	363000	We have a madman on the throne.
363000	366000	Did you see he had those speech notes?
366000	369000	Hey, guys, what's up?
369000	372000	He had those speech notes that someone took a picture of,
372000	375000	and he wrote a-chom-lish-ments.
375000	381000	Instead of accomplishments like A-C-H and then no-P, like a-chom-lish-ments.
381000	384000	I mean, there's a lot of words to misspell,
384000	388000	but I feel like accomplishments not high up on the list.
388000	392000	If this were an ideal world, he would be allowed to be dyslexic and we would be...
392000	393000	That's not dyslexia.
393000	396000	Sorry, sorry, continue.
396000	398000	I think it is dyslexia.
398000	401000	He doesn't know how to read or write because he...
401000	405000	When he looks at letters and words and things, they're jumbled.
405000	409000	And so, unlike a lot of our friends who had that learning disability
409000	413000	diagnosed for them in third grade and put the extra effort in
413000	417000	to re-unjumble the shit as it comes to their brain,
417000	420000	he just was dishonest about it.
420000	422000	He just was like, oh, I'm not going to go to school,
422000	424000	and then here you do my homework, whatever the fuck he did.
424000	425000	I don't know.
425000	429000	We got a lot of people in the world in a lot of states of literacy.
429000	431000	Literacy is a spectrum.
431000	433000	It is.
433000	436000	There's a ton of people who are illiterate in America.
436000	437000	What I'm saying is...
437000	438000	It's a crazy figure.
438000	441000	We can't say he's illiterate because he has read a teleprompter before,
441000	443000	but we do know that he...
443000	444000	I believe...
444000	447000	I would be comfortable diagnosing him as dyslexic.
447000	451000	I believe the frustration that he experiences when he tries to read a prompter
451000	455000	and when he tries to say things and stay on book and stuff,
455000	460000	he's obviously gotten a lot more dopamine spikes from going off book,
460000	465000	and that's why, even though he's kind of dumb, he has that, like, Ilan.
465000	469000	He feels like he's flying as long as he's not reading.
469000	471000	So, even though he's saying the dumbest shit,
471000	473000	he's like, this is so much better than reading!
473000	475000	Yippity-ooh!
476000	478000	I guess that's like me with math.
478000	481000	Like, if I was just like, eight plus eight is ninety-nine!
481000	484000	Like, I'd be excited too, because I'm like, don't make me think about it.
484000	486000	Like, I almost don't know it's sixteen.
486000	488000	Like, I'm going to get yelled at.
488000	491000	Anyways, what I was going to say is in an ideal society,
491000	492000	we would be...
492000	493000	We would...
493000	494000	It would be great.
494000	497000	You know, we've had presidents that are like holding themselves up at the podium
497000	500000	because they got polio legs, and they're in the midst of,
500000	502000	we need the strongest person in the world right now.
502000	503000	We need to be so strong.
503000	506000	It's like, ah, my polio legs, they hurt so much, and I can't...
506000	509000	But then the photographers are like, don't take pictures of those polio legs.
509000	512000	What are you doing? America needs strength right now.
512000	514000	And, you know...
516000	518000	And, you know, we had presidents who's like,
518000	521000	like, their wives are really running the country
521000	524000	because they're like, they're having insulin attacks or something in the caboose.
524000	525000	I think that's the same guy, I can't remember.
525000	526000	In the caboose?
526000	527000	Yeah.
527000	529000	Yeah, wasn't there like a train going around,
529000	530000	and there was like a president's wife who was like,
530000	533000	he says he's proud, and you guys are doing great,
533000	536000	and you need more canals, and choo, choo, choo, choo.
536000	538000	And he was like, in a...
538000	539000	Whose wife is this?
539000	541000	One of the Eisenhower's.
544000	546000	I think there was only one Eisenhower.
547000	552000	It was like the third Roosevelt before the second Bush.
552000	554000	Yeah, but there were four Eisenhower's.
554000	555000	There were four Roosevelt's, yeah.
555000	556000	Four Roosevelt's, yeah.
556000	557000	Anyways, the...
559000	560000	It's sad that we...
560000	563000	The culture of dishonesty, Jeff, is what I'm saying.
563000	564000	Thank you.
564000	567000	Like, why does the truth have to be a bad thing?
567000	574000	When we now know how much obvious lying can be tolerated,
574000	577000	it's like, it's so close to saying it's okay to be honest,
577000	581000	when you're just like, I'm not dumb,
581000	584000	and you like have a dumb hat on, you know?
585000	590000	It's like, you're one lie away from us, no need for the hat,
590000	593000	and you can just say, you are dumb,
593000	595000	and then we can open a book with you,
595000	597000	and you can look at it, and you can go like,
597000	599000	well, still, I don't like this book.
599000	600000	It makes me feel dumb.
600000	601000	That's because you are dumb.
601000	602000	Keep working.
602000	603000	Keep working at it.
603000	604000	I can't work.
604000	605000	I'm president.
605000	608000	Well, yeah, we know, and we elected you because you're dumb.
608000	610000	There's a lot of dumb people in the world.
610000	612000	We love dumb people, but let's try to get smarter.
612000	614000	You know, we could all be honest.
614000	616000	But no, it's all, it's just lying.
616000	618000	Everything's lying now.
618000	620000	Oh, gee, I can't believe that person said that.
620000	622000	Oh, did you hear what they said?
622000	624000	And it doesn't matter if it's true or not.
624000	626000	It's just like whether they said it.
626000	628000	It opens the door for vampirism.
628000	633000	It's people that lie are, they figured it out.
633000	637000	They can say the things that you're supposed to say,
637000	639000	whether anyone believes them or not.
639000	643000	That's a terrible world to create for your shitty little children.
643000	652000	Are you ever going to have a child, you think?
652000	653000	No.
653000	654000	Well, I don't know.
654000	655000	Well, I can't declare that.
655000	657000	I need help if I do.
657000	661000	Wait, walk me through that.
661000	664000	When a man loves a woman.
664000	667000	Children are made by two people.
667000	668000	Thank you, Spencer.
668000	669000	Yeah.
670000	674000	So I'm not, I can't be the arbiter of like, oh no, I'm definitely not going to have one.
674000	677000	Would you like to be a father of a boy or a girl?
677000	681000	I'm getting up there in age and I don't, I feel, I still, no.
681000	687000	I mean, Cody and I are just, Cody and I are up in the air and we're staying there about it.
687000	692000	And I just, it's getting to be a harder sell every day.
692000	695000	Do you think that's something that you could enjoy?
695000	696000	I don't know.
696000	701000	I think, I kind of feel like if you got to ask yourself that about something, you know,
701000	702000	then maybe take a pass.
702000	704000	You're going to be 46 soon.
704000	708000	It's like, when's the last time you like ordered in a restaurant and we're like, do you think
708000	710000	that's something you could enjoy?
710000	712000	You know, like you don't order that stuff.
712000	716000	But yeah, now like, who are you, Charlie Chaplin?
716000	720000	You don't want to be a 46 year old dad now, do you?
720000	730000	Also, whatever factors, if I don't know for sure that I want to be or not, then why do it?
730000	734000	If you had to pick, would you want a boy or a girl?
734000	743000	I just would want it to be, you know, able to take care of itself, I mean.
743000	746000	What a great dad.
746000	751000	Which is the gender that feeds itself as soon as it comes out of the womb?
751000	756000	Like a deer that just like spends some time being adorable and then just like runs off
756000	757000	and starts eating leaves?
757000	758000	Is that a boy or a girl?
758000	761000	That's a girl.
761000	764000	Boys are a fucking nonsense.
764000	765000	It doesn't matter.
765000	768000	What's not, I mean, you know, there's no...
768000	769000	Does Cody want...
769000	772000	Let's face it, both genders are fucking garbage.
772000	775000	Can we at least rise to that level of awareness?
775000	777000	Yeah, they're equidiscently bullshit.
777000	779000	I will absolutely cop to up.
779000	783000	There's a million things that only guys do that are fucking awful.
783000	784000	I listen to True Crime Podcast.
784000	786000	It's like there's not even a debate about that.
786000	787000	It's not a philosophy.
787000	789000	It's not like, ooh, we're socialized to believe that.
789000	793000	It's like crazy, like men are monsters, physically violent monsters.
793000	800000	However, when it comes to who's garbage, like all humans, 85% of all humans,
801000	803000	no matter what category, just dummies.
803000	806000	But if you had to pick, you would pick what?
806000	807000	I don't know.
807000	808000	No, no, honestly, I don't know.
808000	810000	I can't figure out which would be worse.
810000	813000	Would you rather be a father of a boy or...
813000	815000	I understand the question.
815000	820000	I'm saying, not who do you think is better, male or female.
820000	822000	What do you think is easier for you?
822000	824000	Oh, no, I don't.
824000	827000	Honestly, I don't know because it's pros and cons of both.
827000	835000	I mean, from a crime perspective, you're talking about, do you want to worry about someone
835000	839000	or do you want to worry about a million people that that person leaves and goes...
839000	844000	Spencer, would you rather sire a daughter or a son?
844000	845000	I don't know.
845000	848000	I don't know.
848000	850000	If you go by stages...
850000	852000	I go by stages.
852000	856000	Boys suck more earlier.
856000	859000	That's what she said.
859000	866000	The girls are cooler, like zero through three and a half.
866000	867000	Zero.
867000	871000	It's like, why is she so cool?
871000	874000	Her brother was a bag of dicks.
874000	877000	You know, boys start to get a little...
877000	885000	They're a little more whiny and throwing shit around more earlier.
885000	889000	But then everything starts to rollercoaster.
889000	890000	Rollercoaster.
890000	891000	Go on.
891000	897000	I'm saying there's like sine waves of ugly adjustment periods and stuff from what I've seen.
897000	900000	It's just like, there's no science to it.
900000	908000	I would accept it if somebody had a report that said, I'm speculating from my anecdotal observation.
908000	913000	Like, little girls, baby girls are initially...
913000	920000	Like, if you spend two years watching them from birth and then parallel to them, you're watching a little boy.
920000	930000	From my experience, it seems to me, and I pace this largely on watching videos that I get texted by ants.
930000	937000	But like, it just seems to me like the girl makes you want to go like, I hope we have a girl.
937000	940000	What is that reaction? No one knows what that reaction is.
940000	943000	It's just all it is is mugging. There's nothing to that.
943000	947000	No one knows what you're doing other than not liking me or what I'm saying.
947000	950000	You said you get a video from ants.
950000	953000	Yeah, not the...
953000	961000	Has anyone gotten a video from an ant in their lifetime?
961000	965000	Okay, yeah, we see some hands there. We're going to be okay.
965000	967000	Did you think I meant the insect?
967000	969000	I just thought it was funny.
969000	974000	You're scared because you've always said you're scared that ants are getting smarter. The insect.
974000	977000	But I keep saying, Jeff, it's summertime.
977000	981000	They get more active in the summer because they're like heat-based insects.
981000	982000	They like water.
982000	986000	But every year, you forget the previous summer and you're like, they're taking over.
986000	989000	I'm like, no, it's just you left a sandwich out. That's it.
989000	991000	Okay, all right.
991000	997000	I just never received videos from the ants. I don't get ant videos.
997000	1000000	Does your mom have a sister?
1000000	1002000	Does she?
1002000	1004000	Does your mom have a sister?
1004000	1005000	She used to.
1005000	1011000	Okay, well, she doesn't anymore.
1011000	1014000	Someone's walking out because of that.
1014000	1017000	We just walked that guy. He didn't like it.
1017000	1020000	Does your dad have a sister?
1020000	1021000	He used to, too.
1021000	1023000	Did they have phones?
1023000	1024000	Did they have phones?
1024000	1025000	Yes.
1025000	1027000	Did the phones have video cameras in them?
1027000	1028000	No.
1028000	1030000	See? That's why you're confused.
1030000	1032000	But why ants?
1032000	1040000	Because moms and dads aren't the only things that come out of grandmas.
1040000	1043000	Why ants?
1043000	1052000	Because if I got a video from my mom of a two-year-old boy, she'd be a kidnapper.
1052000	1055000	God damn it.
1055000	1059000	Happy Memorial Day.
1059000	1063000	We have as every year because we're proud to do the show.
1063000	1067000	On Memorial Day, we have some of our war trivia.
1067000	1075000	I read an article that said that the first Memorial Day was like freed black slaves that were memorializing the fallen.
1075000	1079000	And then everyone was like, nah, we're starting Memorial Day.
1079000	1082000	And kind of just crushed that out of history for a while.
1082000	1083000	Yeah, I've got that right here.
1083000	1086000	Shit. I stole your thunder.
1086000	1089000	There was a big battle over it.
1089000	1100000	And there's a cemetery where you can go see all the Memorial Day soldiers because it was a big war over who started Memorial Day.
1100000	1103000	It was like a second Civil War.
1103000	1106000	I got it right here.
1106000	1109000	Nantucket, 1897.
1109000	1112000	So this is like well into the reconstruction.
1112000	1117000	And like Spencer said, black soldiers, or they weren't soldiers.
1117000	1121000	They became soldiers because they were trying to celebrate a new thing they called Memorial Day.
1121000	1122000	Thank you.
1122000	1123000	Yeah, yeah.
1123000	1129000	And then a white, the cavalry, it was a cavalry unit, came by and said stop that.
1129000	1131000	And they got in a big fight.
1131000	1133000	And it's in Nantucket.
1133000	1136000	You can go see the cemetery where all their bodies are buried.
1136000	1137000	They all killed each other.
1137000	1141000	It's the only war that ever happened where everybody on both sides died.
1141000	1142000	And that's how the war ended.
1142000	1144000	Usually there's a winner.
1144000	1151000	They couldn't call it a reservoir dog's ending back then because they didn't have that movie yet.
1151000	1156000	And they didn't have any names for it because the only people there, they all died.
1156000	1159000	They got in a big fight and they all drew up the same time.
1159000	1162000	About whether or not there should be a memorial day.
1162000	1163000	About who started Memorial Day.
1163000	1164000	Okay.
1164000	1165000	Yeah.
1165000	1166000	And they all died.
1166000	1169000	And eventually someone had to come by and bury them all and they gave them special graves.
1169000	1172000	It's just outside Nantucket.
1172000	1173000	You can go see it.
1173000	1174000	You just have sight in Nantucket.
1174000	1175000	Yeah.
1175000	1177000	Which means in the Atlantic Ocean.
1177000	1178000	It's in the...
1178000	1189000	Well, I mean, a lot of people believe that Nantucket is the mythical Atlantis.
1189000	1195000	That they brought math to Phoenix.
1195000	1198000	And agriculture.
1198000	1202000	That's what the Peruvians are referring to as Quetzalcoatl.
1202000	1207000	It's just hillbillies that came by in a boat.
1207000	1214000	Why do you think the Peruvians were so involved in Quetzalcoatl Mexican mythology?
1214000	1215000	I don't know.
1215000	1217000	They saw the Mayans doing it and they're like...
1217000	1218000	I'll take a piece of that actually.
1218000	1219000	Yeah.
1219000	1222000	Like, let me get in on some of this ancient civilization business.
1222000	1228000	I want to be an equatorial lost people.
1228000	1229000	Let me do...
1229000	1230000	What do we got to do?
1230000	1231000	We got to build a pyramid?
1231000	1232000	Fine.
1232000	1233000	What do you think is...
1233000	1236000	What's your favorite fun fact about Peru?
1236000	1245000	I like that its capital is not what you think.
1245000	1249000	If I may ask, what do you think the capital of Peru is?
1249000	1252000	Well, a lot of people think it's Colombia.
1252000	1255000	They think the capital of Peru is another country.
1255000	1256000	Right.
1256000	1257000	Yeah.
1257000	1258000	But they'd be wrong.
1258000	1259000	Yeah.
1259000	1260000	But it's not.
1260000	1261000	Well, who thinks that?
1261000	1262000	A lot of people.
1262000	1264000	Just terrible people that...
1264000	1265000	Like, bad.
1265000	1266000	What do you...
1266000	1269000	Like, if you went right now, you and I...
1269000	1270000	If I went to Peru right now?
1270000	1271000	Yeah.
1271000	1272000	You and I are on a road trip.
1272000	1273000	We're in Peru.
1273000	1274000	Right.
1274000	1275000	What road did we take?
1275000	1276000	What's your first stop?
1276000	1279400	What's our first stop in Peru?
1279400	1284000	I would like to go see the famous canyons.
1284000	1285000	Right.
1285000	1289000	They're not called famous canyons because they're bullshit.
1289000	1290000	Yeah, exactly.
1290000	1295000	When I'm a tourist, I don't try to think lateral.
1295000	1297760	Like, take me to the real Peru.
1297760	1299560	That is the real Peru.
1299560	1300560	It's waiting there.
1300560	1302480	It's waiting there for you.
1302480	1306520	There's a reason why people go to take pictures of the Peruvian canyons.
1306520	1307520	Yeah.
1307520	1309020	The famous Peruvian canyons.
1309020	1310180	That's the first place I'd go.
1310180	1311180	That's your first stop.
1311180	1312440	That's where the George Washington of Peru...
1312440	1317000	Now, let's go off the beaten track and then what's your hipster...
1317000	1318000	We're gonna go somewhere groovy.
1318000	1324680	Well, look, I just told you I don't do that, but...
1324680	1325680	Let's say you're gonna be hacked.
1325680	1331880	Yeah, there's a big hipster scene in Peru right now called Neo-Peruvian fusion, whatever.
1331880	1335240	It's like, I don't need that shit.
1335240	1338960	I could get that shit on the Sunset Strip, man.
1338960	1342480	I'm not going to fucking downtown Peru.
1342480	1344480	I'm going to the canyons.
1344480	1347400	Downtown Peru.
1347440	1350120	I'm going to the canyons, baby.
1350120	1353120	Where it all started.
1353120	1356840	That's why they're called canyons because it starts low.
1356840	1357840	Yeah.
1357840	1358840	Yeah.
1358840	1359840	All right.
1359840	1367700	So, we're gonna do horoscopes now.
1367700	1370400	We're gonna do more segments in the show.
1370400	1371400	That's cool.
1371400	1373160	Oh, did I finish with my Memorial Day trivia?
1373160	1374160	No.
1374160	1375160	Well, yeah.
1375160	1378160	Maybe war trivia, and then you guys started...
1378160	1379160	Biting your head off.
1379160	1384960	I just started sharing some stuff, and then I, as a yes, handed it, and then we saw how
1384960	1386960	that went.
1386960	1387960	What horoscope?
1387960	1388960	What...
1388960	1389960	War trivia.
1389960	1392040	War trivia is the first thing I said.
1392040	1393040	We can skip that.
1393040	1395840	I got a bunch of war trivia.
1395840	1399320	Do you want music for this?
1399320	1400320	Sure.
1400320	1401320	Okay.
1401320	1406040	All right.
1406040	1416760	Okay, so, 1943, the bloodiest battle of World War II.
1416760	1419880	Where was that staged?
1419880	1426520	It was an island in the South Pacific called Guadalcanal.
1426520	1427520	Your dad died there.
1427520	1428520	Grandpa.
1428520	1429520	Grandpa.
1429520	1430520	Did not die there.
1430520	1433920	Just killed a lot of people, probably.
1433920	1435000	Never talked about it.
1435000	1437320	The Silent Generation, they called him.
1437320	1438320	Didn't say much.
1438320	1442760	I mean, he talked a lot, but not about the war.
1442760	1443760	Right.
1443760	1447640	What did he talk about when he wasn't talking about the war?
1447640	1450840	What was his topic of choice?
1450840	1457600	He liked to build stuff, like decks.
1457600	1464320	He was a welder.
1464320	1467360	He kind of would make fun of my great-grandma.
1467360	1468360	Bushe?
1468360	1469360	Yeah.
1469360	1473240	But, you know, I wasn't around to...
1473240	1474640	But didn't Grandma Bushe kill a...
1474640	1475840	She stabbed a person.
1475840	1479920	Yeah, but these people are all dead now, so I feel like we can't even...
1479920	1486600	I'm so sick of sharing my, like, family goodies and then, like, when I talk to my mom about
1486600	1487600	it, I'm like...
1487600	1488600	I always...
1488600	1489600	She's like, where did you hear that?
1489600	1493800	And I'm like, I don't want to be a part of this disintegration of all of the truth of
1493800	1496520	my family, you know?
1496520	1497520	Like I don't...
1497520	1498520	There's so many, like, little details.
1498520	1500520	I don't know if this is happening to you guys.
1500520	1502560	I'm sure you talked to your...
1502560	1505160	Maybe you're younger, but, like, it's just, like...
1505160	1507320	I don't know if this is a...
1507320	1508320	It's just...
1508320	1514520	It's like the inversion of the terrible twos, like your parents just start learning the
1514520	1515520	word no.
1516040	1519200	Like, as they become adult children, it's just like...
1519200	1522560	And then remember that one thing we always joke about, no, we don't.
1522560	1523560	It's just like...
1523560	1527920	I'm gonna take as much as I give now, I'm 70.
1527920	1528920	It's just...
1528920	1535440	They just start to get a little snotty at the end there, like, they're just like...
1535440	1536440	Maybe not.
1536440	1537440	I don't know.
1537440	1538440	Maybe you weren't a good kid.
1538440	1539440	I don't know.
1539440	1541840	You know, they're just sort of, like, hacking everything now.
1541840	1545320	It's this trump that's made the baby boomers all fucking nutty.
1545320	1546320	They're just like, what's truth?
1546320	1547320	I don't know.
1547320	1548320	Fake news.
1548320	1549320	Like...
1549320	1553240	And so I don't even want to, like, bring the precious stuff over, like, I want to keep
1553240	1556840	that lore, like, because now everything's up for debate.
1556840	1557840	Like, I don't...
1557840	1558840	I go...
1558840	1560440	I ask my mom for...
1560440	1564440	You got any of the home movies?
1564440	1566720	You know, like, she's like, what?
1566720	1567720	Home movies?
1567720	1571760	Like, looked at me like I had just a fucking piece of shit.
1571760	1572760	Your mom?
1573200	1576040	Yeah, like, I was talking in Martian or something.
1576040	1577400	I'm like, yeah, the home movies.
1577400	1578400	Like, I don't know.
1578400	1585240	Don't you have, like, that CD, the DVD with, like, all the shit you compiled that's, like,
1585240	1586920	on all the old Super 8 stuff?
1586920	1590720	She's like, uh, I don't know what you're talking about.
1590720	1596320	And then she looked at Cody and she's like, we were a poor family.
1596320	1599400	We couldn't really afford cameras and things when we were a thing.
1599400	1602400	And I was like, mom, what?
1603040	1604040	I don't know, dude.
1604040	1605840	Your dad's business was recording stuff.
1605840	1606840	Yeah.
1606840	1608840	And I was just like...
1608840	1609840	And here's the thing.
1609840	1616120	Right now, one way or another, my mom's gonna hear this, and then it's more fucking butter
1616120	1617120	in the churn.
1617120	1622600	It's just more fucking shit that I don't, it's like, I don't...
1622600	1627040	The next thing I'll hear if I hear anything is, I didn't say that.
1627040	1631320	We didn't have that conversation where I said we never had cameras.
1632120	1633120	I don't care.
1633120	1634120	I love her.
1634120	1635120	Mom, I love you.
1635120	1639920	I'm like, I promise I won't talk about my family anymore.
1639920	1640920	Jesus Christ.
1640920	1643360	I just want it to be like a fucking crater.
1643360	1646320	But there is video evidence of the things you're talking about.
1646320	1648400	Yeah, I mean, yeah.
1648400	1651400	It's fucking insane.
1651400	1656160	And then the shit she remembers, she went through a 20-cat list of all the cats we've
1656160	1657160	killed.
1657160	1659480	It was like...
1660480	1662480	She got lost in that shit.
1662480	1663480	Let's talk about that.
1663480	1664800	It was like, fuck it.
1664800	1666720	I was like gripping Cody's hand.
1666720	1669680	I was like, this is some fucking podcast shit.
1669680	1672760	I mean, talking to like, what's his name?
1672760	1675680	Israel Keys tapes and shit.
1675680	1678440	Like she was just going through the...
1678440	1680320	She just got lost.
1680320	1687000	She was talking about the cats that they do have, and then there was the cats that we
1687000	1690320	did have, and then the cat, and then like, you know, and then she's mentioning like,
1690320	1693400	well, then that cat got sick, and then, you know, it's hard with cats, and then she was
1693400	1697800	just like kind of backtracking through this big, long list, and then a lot of them had
1697800	1702480	like questionable kills in there, like it was sort of like, oh, and then Mr. Peanut,
1702480	1707280	you know, he kept going near the pool, and you can't have a cat go near the pool, so
1707280	1710040	you know, it was like, holy shit, she's Dexter.
1710040	1712160	She's cat Dexter.
1712160	1714200	Like she's just making up reasons now.
1714200	1718480	I didn't even know this until, like, she's just like, oh, and he didn't like how loud
1718480	1725320	the fridge was, so arsenic and old lace, like just fucking, oh, god damn, this bitch kills
1725320	1726320	cats.
1726320	1730560	And remembers every goddamn one, but she thinks cameras don't exist.
1730560	1732840	Like I'm tired of it.
1732840	1736160	And don't even be telling me about no dementia or Alzheimer's, it ain't that.
1736160	1737160	It's not that.
1737160	1743720	It's like, it's this Facebook, like, Trump-like fake news thing.
1743720	1748760	It's like this fucking Fox News, like, and my mom's not conservative, not that that matters,
1748760	1753200	but I'm just saying, like, it's this fucking world that's been created around them.
1753200	1759040	We took a generation that was like so fucking orgasmically proud of itself, like just, oh,
1759040	1763840	this is like, they're like, like, watching a dude bounce around on the moon, and like,
1763840	1768120	he's just going like, I'm on the moon, you did it, you did it, teenagers, thanks.
1768120	1774140	He's Elvis and the Beatles as a reward for putting me on a moon.
1774140	1781320	And they were just like, oh, oh, oh, we should have as many babies as our parents did, even
1781320	1783840	though the reason they did is because they fought Hitler.
1783840	1784840	Let's do it.
1784840	1785840	We earned it.
1785840	1789760	We put a guy on the moon, and then they're like, whoa, peace, love, and all that Forrest
1789760	1790760	Gump shit.
1790760	1797600	And then like, they're just like, it was just a dangerous animal to put in a digital box.
1797600	1800160	So it was just a fucked up thing to do.
1800160	1804980	Like they weren't ready for the.
1804980	1809640	They weren't ready for the fucking Lawn Mower Man threshold.
1809640	1812440	They weren't ready to become cyber Christ.
1812440	1818080	Like, like, like, like, I should have known for the look in my mom's eye, the minute she
1818080	1820200	got ahold of a Tetris paddle.
1820200	1824440	Like I should have recognized the look, but I didn't know I was like addicted to video
1824440	1825440	games and stuff too.
1825440	1827760	It's just like, oh, they're not ready.
1827760	1829720	They're not ready for the dopamine.
1829720	1834960	They're like, oh my God, Jesus, there's a farm on my, on the same screen where I can
1834960	1837080	check in with my grandkids.
1837080	1839400	They're just, they lost their fucking mind.
1839400	1843880	And then the, and then 9 11 happened and they're like, that Eagles crying in the email, the
1843880	1849080	Eagles crying in the email, they freaked the fuck out.
1849080	1853080	All of us are getting all these emails at all the emails, the coat hanger band, and he's
1853200	1854200	coming for you.
1854200	1855200	Where's building seven?
1855200	1857400	The Eagles crying.
1857400	1858400	It became like a meme.
1858400	1860040	They're like, dad, stop forwarding.
1860040	1864600	You know, it's like, oh, here's a Polish joke and here's a fucking crying Eagle.
1864600	1867360	And here's a warning about your pantyhose are giving you cancer.
1867360	1868640	And I was like, they're just kidding.
1868640	1873000	And then, and then, and then, and then the key, you know, some, some fucking, uh, clever
1873000	1877880	little AI figured out that only took him 25 years ago, like, gee, I guess you could win
1877880	1879160	an election this way.
1879160	1881840	I mean, these people technically are allowed to vote.
1881840	1882840	Fuck it.
1882840	1889800	Hey, did you hear there's a black guy under your car, Minnesota vote for Trump.
1889800	1892600	And they're just like, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click,
1892600	1897200	click, click, click, click, click, and fucking idiots stick, but they weren't ready for it.
1897200	1898760	They just weren't ready.
1898760	1901080	My mom, my mom's a similar story.
1901080	1905320	Like even when I was like early twenties, like there was stuff where it's like very
1905320	1909960	clear, vivid memories of stuff that happened and stuff that was validated by their stories
1909960	1910960	later on.
1910960	1914800	I remember when we did this thing and then it's just like, they just have no recollection
1914800	1915800	of it.
1915800	1916800	It's like, okay.
1916800	1917800	And they get kind of mad too.
1917800	1922360	And I think there's a little bit of edge to it with me where it's like, oh, Dan, the,
1922360	1929240	the, the, the black sheep, you know, the guy with the motor mouth, Mr. Podcast, Mr. fucking
1929240	1934760	TMZ, Mr. You know, and my mom's super into like health stuff and always has been like
1934760	1936720	caring about health and alternative health.
1936720	1940360	And so she's on Facebook now and she's like, you know, these people are drinking down watered
1940360	1941360	down bleach.
1941360	1942360	It's curing their cancer.
1942360	1945440	And I'm like, I don't, I don't think that's happening.
1945440	1948480	I think you gotta, yeah, it's, it's scary stuff.
1948480	1951840	You gotta water down your bleach, by the way, you do, especially if you're going to drink
1951840	1955920	it to cure your cancer, drinking straight bleach, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta water.
1955920	1962040	I mean, truly like, like they got on, they got on that Facebook arc and they were just
1962040	1963640	like, oh, this is wonderful.
1963640	1964640	I like the cushions.
1964640	1965880	There's a slot machine.
1965880	1969680	How many fucking Muslims are there?
1969680	1971720	They were just like, what is with this?
1971720	1972720	What is happening?
1972720	1976360	There's a slot with the Congress and the, what is happening?
1976360	1978120	They were like freaking out.
1978120	1979880	And then it was like easy to grab them.
1979880	1983680	I mean, I, I'm 46 and I was, I wasn't ready.
1983680	1991120	Like, uh, these fucking, uh, fucking potato people, uh, like, I don't know too many for
1991120	1992120	anybody.
1992120	1993120	Right.
1993120	1994800	Oh my God.
1994800	2001960	He said those, that combination of words and then it's just the worst.
2001960	2004400	Like like, don't, don't fuck up my already bad mood.
2004400	2010520	You get a bunch of fucking raisinets raisinets.
2010520	2011960	That's the worst thing you could call somebody.
2011960	2016720	I mean, thanks for coming out and everything.
2016720	2021720	I hope you have a safe drive home, but please don't be so stupid that I have to get angry
2021720	2023480	at you.
2023480	2029000	And by stupid, I mean, don't have a visceral, autonomic, unconscious reactions to things
2029000	2032760	that sound racist.
2032760	2038720	Be sophisticated, suck up the toxicity and just process it and just let it go through
2038720	2048240	all your veins and take it home with you and like wipe it on your significant other.
2048240	2053400	Seize it in the shower in a, in a, in a nice, in a steam.
2053400	2056240	That's what my generation used to do is take it in.
2056240	2058320	You read something stupid on a billboard.
2058320	2060840	You can't, you can't go, you can't give it a thumbs down.
2060840	2061840	We didn't have that luxury.
2061840	2065600	We were just like, I hate it.
2065600	2067760	I hate everything.
2067760	2069120	I hate the sandwich.
2069120	2071120	I hate, I hate Mickey mouse.
2071120	2072120	I hate Coca-Cola.
2072120	2074120	Oh, I hate corporations.
2074120	2076720	Oh, I'm going to have a baby.
2076720	2077720	Hey bud.
2077720	2078720	Hey bro.
2078720	2079720	Hey bud.
2079720	2080720	Hey bro.
2080720	2081720	Hey bud.
2081720	2082720	Hey, you're my bro.
2082720	2084560	You're my baby, but you're my bro.
2084560	2085920	I'm never going to hit you.
2085920	2091200	And that's all I'm going to do.
2091200	2092200	That's it.
2092200	2094200	That's the Mount Everest of parenting.
2094200	2095200	Hey bro.
2095200	2096200	Hey bud.
2096200	2098480	Same level equals, right?
2098480	2102760	I'm going to be a fucking horrible person.
2102760	2103760	That's cool.
2103760	2104760	Cool with me, bro.
2104760	2107600	I didn't hit you though.
2107600	2110360	I never laid a fucking finger on you.
2110360	2113360	You should have a kid.
2113360	2115360	Yeah.
2115360	2118760	Nah dog.
2118760	2121280	Don't talk to me after all that.
2121280	2124560	I don't want no kid running around my house.
2124560	2127960	I don't know.
2127960	2133640	Sometimes, sometimes I, sometimes I think maybe I like, I like that they like, I like
2133640	2137560	that they like, like bits, you know, like, I like that they like songs.
2137560	2141400	Like you can make up a song and they'll, they'll like the song.
2141400	2142400	I mean, that's cool.
2142400	2143400	Yeah.
2143400	2145440	Like they'll, they'll be a fan of the song that you make up.
2145440	2149960	Like they'll, you can like, you can go like, my name is poopy butter nuts.
2149960	2154560	I like to eat the buttercup and they'll just be like, they'll start, they'll memorize it,
2154560	2155560	start singing it.
2155560	2156560	Like they'll build.
2156560	2160080	My dad sang like hilarious improv songs all the time.
2160080	2163560	I think that's why I like bad improv songs.
2163560	2165800	So that, but, but that seems like a bad reason.
2165800	2169520	That doesn't seem like a good reason to have a kid, but then you start thinking, well,
2169520	2172520	what are you supposed to follow your bliss when it comes to having a kid, then don't
2172520	2173520	have a kid, right?
2173520	2175760	Like, like, cause that kid's going to poop their pants.
2175760	2183640	Oh, speaking of pooping, so we, we went house hunting this weekend, found a really, we find
2183640	2186800	we've been very picky and very taken it very slowly.
2186800	2188960	This isn't, this isn't like, we need a house.
2188960	2192520	This is like, where do we want to die or whatever?
2193120	2196080	Like what's too much, you know, too much bliss.
2196080	2197880	Like we're already happy.
2197880	2199520	What would make it a little ridiculous?
2199520	2204480	What would make me come home from work every day and go, fuck you?
2204480	2207600	That's the standard I'm holding it to when I go to these open houses.
2207600	2209440	I want to, I want so much house.
2209440	2214120	I want to like, like take a couple of turns and be like, where the fuck am I?
2214120	2217360	How many fucking, how many fucking ways to get to the pool are there?
2217360	2219800	Jesus Christ.
2219800	2220800	What is this a guy?
2220800	2222080	What is a governor live here?
2222080	2223200	I'm going to punch someone.
2223200	2225160	He showed me a photo of this house.
2225160	2227080	Are you going to be in the pool?
2227080	2229920	You don't strike me as a pool goer.
2229920	2237280	That pool is all about, dude, that's, that's Cody's got to have a pool and I got to have
2237280	2238280	a Cody.
2238280	2241680	You got to have a Cody that I agree with, but like, why do you have, like, you're not
2241680	2242880	going to go in that pool.
2242880	2244960	So what do you want me to do?
2244960	2246960	How does this work with your mind?
2246960	2250240	I'm saying, Cody, I don't need a pool and you do need a pool.
2250240	2251240	Let's compromise.
2251240	2254640	Are you, are you going to have pool parties or are you going to be the, yes, of course
2254640	2255640	I will have pool parties.
2255640	2259200	Why did you ask the question so that you can fight with me?
2259200	2261280	What kind of co-host are you?
2261280	2264760	I don't think that you're going to, you're ever going to go in the pool.
2264760	2265760	I, okay.
2265760	2269520	I mean, what do you, you're like, ask her the grouch or something.
2269520	2274200	What do you, you're looking, you're actively looking for like things to argue about.
2274200	2279160	I'm just saying, is there a world where Dan Harmon is a pool swimmer?
2279160	2286200	I, I'll get in, I'll get in a pool as, as, as little as the next guy.
2286200	2288320	I mean, I'm going to, I want you to go in the pool.
2288320	2290240	I'm not saying I don't want you to go in the pool.
2290240	2291240	I don't know.
2291240	2293200	I just wonder whether you're going to go in the pool.
2293200	2295200	I'm going to have a pool.
2295200	2296200	Right.
2296200	2297200	I'm going to own the pool.
2297200	2298200	Right.
2298200	2300280	Cody is going to be very happy.
2300280	2301280	Be in the pool.
2301280	2302280	To be in the pool.
2302280	2303280	Okay.
2303280	2305400	And the pool is going to be right there at my house.
2305400	2306400	Dang it.
2306400	2310800	Cody and I, a very happy functional couple where I like, I could sit next to it.
2310800	2313440	If I don't want to get in it, I can, I could sit next to it.
2313440	2319040	Do you think that you might become a pool person after you have a pool?
2319040	2320040	Never know.
2320040	2322720	Not necessary in order for me to continue to enjoy the pool though.
2322720	2323720	Right.
2323720	2325040	Because I'll be like, well, I got that pool.
2325040	2326880	It's not pool based.
2326880	2327880	You having a pool.
2327880	2328880	I'm not, yeah, exactly.
2328880	2331280	I'm not like, I can't wait to be a pool guy.
2331280	2333560	This pool is going to change me.
2333560	2337200	It's like, this, this pool is going to be a great thing to have.
2337200	2340200	I'm picturing you becoming very tan.
2340200	2343760	Like you're going to be Ray Winston and sexy beast and yet you live in Greece and you have
2343760	2348440	a, you have a, you have a pool and that you're just, you're just really tan.
2348440	2349440	Yeah.
2349440	2351320	I'm, I'll probably just clip my toenails more.
2351320	2353320	I think that'll do.
2353320	2354800	Wait, why, why, why is that?
2354800	2360200	Well, because I feel like the pool lifestyle involves more like bare feet and aunt plus
2360200	2362120	like more company.
2362120	2363120	Right.
2363160	2368240	Right now, Cody's being way too tolerant of some fucking gnarly shit going on on my leg.
2368240	2370880	I, I, it's just, I don't break it down.
2370880	2375000	Well, I just have fucking nasty disgusting toenails right now and I, I always do.
2375000	2380640	I, I clip them and then I get to spend like two days being proud of myself, like a while
2380640	2386200	walk around in the sandals or, you know, I'll get the food and the bare feet and then from
2386200	2391360	the, from the door, that's where food comes from front door.
2392120	2395120	And I'm just like, Hey, thanks.
2395120	2402080	I do a little, I put a little, little like, do you ever go get your nails did like, no,
2402080	2407240	I'm never going to do that because I, but then the thing is they just shoot out everything
2407240	2408240	in my body.
2408240	2412640	The hair and the nails and everything just, everything just shoots out like, like I'm
2412640	2418760	just like a fucking like pustule of like a hair and oil.
2418760	2420840	Let's you and me go get our nails done together.
2421360	2424280	So anyway, that could be really fun doing this.
2424320	2425320	We went to this house.
2425320	2430000	We like this house and me and Cody liked the house.
2430840	2432280	Did you say who did pooping?
2432360	2432880	Oh, pooping.
2433760	2434080	Yes.
2437800	2439320	I was like, really?
2439360	2442880	It was getting so excited because we've been, we've been so picky about that and we've been
2442880	2447760	looking at a lot of houses and it's like starting to wonder, I, this is kind of crazy.
2447760	2449640	Is it possible to please us?
2449640	2453280	Like, are we ever going to like, and I guess that's okay.
2453280	2456520	I already got, I mean, there's no hurry, but at the same time you start to think like,
2456520	2461120	wait, what is, what's like, I guess maybe, maybe houses just suck.
2461160	2463320	Maybe just all houses doesn't matter.
2463640	2467400	And then, and then finally you just walk into one where you both are vibing it.
2467400	2470880	And then we're walking around like, oh my God, oh my God, this is the best house.
2471040	2471640	This is the best house.
2471680	2475600	And it was like a, like a new house and they just built it.
2476600	2485000	And, and so they were having an open house and there were these old ladies hanging out.
2485120	2486160	They were just hanging out.
2486240	2487800	It was like a gang of old ladies.
2487800	2490520	I swear they just live in the neighborhood and they just came there.
2490960	2491960	Oh, it's an open house.
2492000	2492960	Was it cactus punch?
2494480	2495080	Cactus punch.
2495080	2495280	Yeah.
2495600	2501680	They, they, they, they were sitting in the, in one of the, in the, like in the side room
2501680	2503600	and one of them had a bag of groceries.
2503600	2506240	Like they, it was just like, they're just like, Hey, it's an open house.
2506240	2508800	Let's go look at these houses and we'll just hang out.
2508800	2510520	They were just sitting and hanging out with it.
2510520	2514400	Were they looking for houses or they just, my suspicion is no.
2514440	2518720	I mean, it just, I, but I don't want to be, you know, I mean, like, I guess maybe one
2518720	2521360	of them be like, okay, I'm going to buy it.
2521360	2525280	Cause I can, I, I just needed to break it in and feel like I could get, could be
2525280	2529880	coming home from groceries and hang out with my friends and I don't think, I think
2529880	2532880	they were just looky lose, you know, they were just like, they were just hanging out.
2533520	2537600	So not, not a crime, but, uh, kind of in the way a lot, but, uh, but a big house.
2537600	2538520	So they weren't really in the way.
2538760	2543120	And then like the last, it was like on the tail end of, I'm so excited, so excited
2543120	2544000	about this house, man.
2544000	2545240	I'm just like getting really excited.
2545240	2547080	I think we're going to actually put an offer on this place there.
2547080	2548880	You really say, yeah, they like you.
2549240	2549680	Oh my God.
2549920	2554240	Oh, oh, and there's another, oh, you, did you see the other bathroom over here?
2554400	2558360	Oh, and they're like, went in there and it was like, Oh, this is a good bathroom.
2559200	2562840	Oh, oh, like one of those ladies took a huge shit.
2562880	2567680	No, in the open house, it's like marked for life.
2567680	2568760	Now it's crazy.
2569160	2570120	I'm kind of stoked about it.
2570120	2571360	Cause it's going to be legendary.
2571360	2574200	Like, Oh, I just, but, but it was, I just couldn't believe it.
2574320	2575960	I took the first poop in your place.
2576600	2580240	Yeah, but it wasn't an open house.
2580240	2582320	I just, you go into an open house and you took a dump.
2582320	2583080	It's pretty amazing.
2584200	2585520	That's what the kids would call baller.
2585520	2588480	I guess for an old lady, that's like, like gangsta old lady.
2588480	2592200	Like she just took a dump in the open house toilet and then just sat
2592200	2594040	next to it and was like, what if that's their game?
2594520	2596320	They just go around pooping in people's houses.
2597040	2600600	So we looked at this other place and, uh, and Cody's immediately, she's
2600600	2602840	like, I don't like, I don't like the vibe of this place.
2602880	2603800	I'm like, what's the vibe?
2603800	2605800	You gotta, I, it's okay for you.
2605800	2608640	I don't like, I just want to make sure you're not talking about the wallpaper.
2608640	2609520	Cause that can change.
2609520	2612440	You know, it's like, it's hard to talk about whether you like a place or not.
2612920	2615120	And like, like, and it's just like, I don't know.
2615120	2617120	I just don't like, I just don't like the feeling of the place.
2617120	2618160	I don't like the feeling of it.
2618520	2623000	And, uh, uh, like, uh, I guess the layout and it's like, whatever.
2623040	2627800	Uh, and then, uh, the realtor guy is like, you know, and it's great.
2627840	2630000	Uh, it's a great neighborhood, a lot of great places to eat.
2630000	2632560	You know, what's over there is a cafe, such and such.
2632880	2635440	And, uh, and Cody goes, Oh yeah.
2635440	2640360	Isn't that, uh, isn't that where Robert Blake shot his wife?
2640880	2641240	Oh yeah.
2641240	2641560	I think so.
2641560	2643640	I think that, I think that might be, I think that might be it.
2643640	2644040	Yeah.
2644360	2645760	And then we continue looking at the house.
2647040	2647720	They changed it now.
2647720	2648800	And we go home, we get in bed.
2648840	2652000	We were like the thing where like, I'm like, you sure you don't like that?
2652280	2657240	And then the email bing and the real, the, it's our realtor say that realtor
2657240	2660600	just emailed, he's saying it was Robert Blake's house.
2663160	2666360	I was like, but you were talking about, uh, you, you, if it's listed,
2666360	2669160	you might want to move into the, uh, I don't know.
2669160	2670680	I never said I might want to move.
2670680	2674120	Well, I mean, like, like when he's talking about the, and by the way, I
2674120	2675800	don't know why I thought it was listed.
2676120	2680520	I don't know how I got that conflated, but it goes up for a sale once in a
2680520	2683200	while, because nobody wants to live in the house where the murders happened.
2683240	2688160	The, uh, George Hodel house, Hodel, the, um, the black Dahlia.
2688240	2688600	Yeah.
2688600	2691960	The guy who probably maybe killed the black Dahlia probably in that house.
2691960	2696400	If he did, uh, in the basement and that, that it's a house on, uh, yeah, whatever.
2696880	2698320	But it's like, it's like, it's a Lloyd Wright.
2698320	2703200	It looks like a stone, butthole outside that's got this weird kind of architectural.
2703200	2705640	No, I would never, I would never, I don't.
2705800	2711480	No, unless if my partner was like through the roof about it was like, I want
2711480	2716720	to live in the house where a famous murder happened, I, I, I, it would be like a pool.
2716720	2720960	I mean, I'd be like, well, it's, I mean, you being happy is like very important to me.
2721040	2725440	I, if it's haunted, I guess we can move.
2726240	2731480	And when they relisted it, like a couple of years ago, uh, the police, like
2731480	2735960	somebody was rephrasing the house and they brought cadaver dogs and they hit on the
2735960	2741200	fucking room where all the murders, like, like somebody died there and you don't want
2741200	2741840	to live in that house.
2741840	2746160	It's kind of a closed case, that, that, that little nugget because it never was
2746160	2747720	official because it's like all the stuff.
2748040	2749520	There's no, uh, what do you call it?
2749520	2751080	Corpus to like this corpus.
2751280	2755880	But you know, aspyd who was on the show, who did you, did you get, you guys enjoy?
2755880	2757240	Well, don't let me put you on the spot.
2757360	2759320	Do you guys like, you like our friend Ryan Krauss?
2759320	2765200	You're like, fuck yeah, uh, cause we'll, we'll, we'll have him back all the time.
2765280	2767560	Uh, I say, I like him as a person.
2767560	2768400	I think he's a great guy.
2768680	2775080	Uh, uh, uh, but he was telling me that the, that guy who's like the hero of that
2775080	2781960	story is like Hodel's son who became a cop and then, and then, and then he became
2781960	2786080	convinced that his dad was the black Dahlia murder and he basically like spent the rest
2786080	2790680	of his life in retirement, like building the case and solving it.
2790680	2792480	Like, like, yeah, that was my dad did it.
2792800	2795040	And then it seemed pretty legit to me.
2795080	2796640	And then you can listen to that podcast.
2796640	2797880	I can't remember what it's called now.
2797880	2798480	God damn it.
2798480	2802200	It's like a serial podcast that's produced by some of the Hodel children.
2802760	2810480	Um, uh, the, but then aspyd was saying, yeah, but then that guy lost all his
2810480	2814280	credibility when he started saying, oh yeah, and plus he might've been a Zodiac.
2815160	2815800	And I was like, really?
2815800	2816680	That was him.
2816680	2820080	I didn't look that like, like, like, like he wasn't the Zodiac.
2820640	2825760	I mean, whether he was or not, it was like, I didn't, he made it sound like maybe the
2825760	2830000	same guy that I thought was like a smart, the, the, the detective guy that retired
2830000	2832280	and proved that his dad was the black Dahlia murderer.
2832600	2838480	Then, uh, later on was like, plus he was the Zodiac killer, which would change
2838480	2843040	things in my head about whether or not this guy actually, I mean, anyways, not
2843040	2848360	interesting, Dan Harmon, we don't care about your dumb, uh, conversations with
2848360	2852120	yourself about a fucking crime within a crime within a true crime podcast.
2852480	2854760	The rest of us are living our lives.
2854760	2855800	We're into self care.
2855920	2860920	We're not, we're not in a toxic tailspin where we, uh, play, uh, match games,
2860960	2867000	uh, like, uh, best fiends, um, uh, or, or, or candy cookie cookies.
2867280	2872640	Uh, while we listened to podcasts about murder, because we're obviously like
2872640	2876200	having a real hard time and we're not admitting it, like we're, we're, we're,
2876200	2882880	we're, we're doing yoga and, uh, we, we, we, we only listened to, uh, uh, uh, uh,
2882920	2885200	uh, uh, uh, shows about yoga.
2887360	2889280	Are you going through a rough patch right now?
2889320	2890200	No, I don't think so.
2890200	2890800	They do.
2892320	2893200	You heard him.
2893640	2897360	That was them pay attention.
2897640	2898760	Wasn't me talking.
2898760	2899720	I'm fucking happy.
2899800	2901160	What's best fiends.
2901720	2905120	It's, uh, it's like a matchy, it's one of those matchy games where like the
2905120	2907640	matching like shoots the bad guy.
2908920	2909320	Oh yeah.
2909320	2909600	Yeah.
2909600	2909800	Yeah.
2909840	2914000	Where you like, it's like, you get a bunch of different colored cookie candy things
2914000	2918240	and then you, you know, like, you know, you connect them, connect the ones that
2918240	2922560	are next to each other and then they're best fiend about, uh, Klaus Kinski and, uh,
2923080	2923840	Werner Herzog.
2923920	2924240	Yeah.
2924520	2925080	It's really good.
2925680	2926160	Yeah.
2926720	2928080	Is that, is that what it's based on?
2928320	2929160	Yeah, it's based on that.
2929160	2929360	Yeah.
2929360	2932720	You're killing, you're attacking Werner Herzog.
2934400	2938400	It was advertised in this true crime podcast called the, uh, I never remember
2938400	2940440	the names, they're also bad at naming their podcast.
2940560	2943760	I think it's called the serial killer podcast.
2946080	2947560	It's this Norwegian guy.
2948280	2952360	His name is like Thomas born cyborg or something.
2953160	2955680	Hello, Thomas born listeners.
2955720	2958520	It's me, Thomas born cyborg born.
2959440	2966920	Here your Norwegian hosts here to talk about the insidious Jeffrey Dahmer.
2967520	2970560	And then every time he mentions, like, if there's anything that happens in,
2970560	2974920	like Louisiana or Atlanta or anything like that, he affects this, uh, weird
2974920	2980640	accent, uh, like he starts talking like a, like a, like a Southern American.
2980840	2983160	Like, I was like, I try, I try.
2983160	2985280	I mean, it's hard to do his accent from the beginning.
2985280	2992720	So like, uh, the, the, the toy box killer was the most prolific, uh, serial
2992720	2996120	killer, depending on who, who you believe.
2996440	3004520	Texas, Texas authorities say that he might've killed as many as a 500 people.
3005680	3010280	Like, like he, he just, he just starts talking like his version of Southern
3010280	3013320	Americans, just because he's like, I'm going to give it a little cayenne
3013360	3015320	pepper, cause we're talking Louisiana here.
3016240	3021680	And, uh, and it was like, normally it's charming, but then there was one episode
3021680	3025400	where he was, the whole story was about the Atlanta ripper, which was like this
3025400	3031760	fucked up, like, uh, uh, I can't remember if it was like during reconstruction or
3031760	3037240	like if it was during the civil war or before it was like around a time, like
3037240	3042480	when, unlike now, when things were not hunky dory, like in terms of between
3042480	3046760	people talking to each other and, um, and there was like a serial killer who
3046760	3050680	was like killing, uh, uh, it was, it was, it was like Jack the ripper, but in
3050680	3055440	Atlanta and it, but, and steeped in racism, like in terms of the suspect and
3055440	3058400	the, and the, who was getting charged and what the cops were doing with all the
3058400	3063800	time and like that, that was like him, he didn't, he didn't, he's purely
3063800	3065200	innocent, but it was just amazing.
3065200	3067440	The effect of it being like a train crash.
3067440	3074600	It was like he was him reading quotes from racist cops at the turn of the
3074600	3078680	century, um, in this silly accent.
3078680	3083240	And also he sounds like, you know, the guy from the sugar cubes and like, it's just
3083240	3087520	sort of like the effect was like, and then the, and the next episode he was
3087520	3092920	like, hello, dear listeners, it's time for more creepy crawly, a serial killer
3092920	3099880	podcasting, I, a lot of reviews from the last episode saying, don't do that anymore.
3099880	3109160	And I won't, uh, my hat, my hats off to people that read, read their reviews of
3109160	3112960	anything goddamn and then, and then take it right on the chin and make an
3112960	3115840	adjustment or don't, you know, have you totally stopped doing that?
3116280	3117800	Yeah, I can't anymore.
3117880	3120320	I can't, it's hard to get the podcast reviews.
3120320	3124000	You really have to go out of your way to look for your podcast reviews.
3124160	3124480	Yeah.
3124480	3128440	Like ostensibly they would be like, you go on Reddit, right?
3128440	3129800	Like, Oh, I go on Reddit.
3130400	3131760	So shut the fuck up.
3133120	3134600	Just back the fuck off.
3134640	3135560	Cause I'm there.
3136760	3138880	No, but I'm just, I'm talking about the iTunes reviews.
3138880	3139280	It's funny.
3139280	3141960	You know, ASPD, like one of his earliest episodes.
3142920	3143280	Yeah.
3143320	3145240	And I'm sorry if you're listening to this, no offense.
3145240	3149880	This is a reporting facts, but, um, he early on, he's like, give me, give me
3149880	3152120	reviews, even a one star review is fine.
3152120	3153480	It helps me understand what I'm doing.
3153480	3157040	And like the next time he invokes reviews, he's like, give me a five star review.
3157320	3160560	And then like the next time he invokes reviews, he's like, give me a five star
3160560	3160840	review.
3160840	3162720	I know some of you won't, but please do.
3162920	3164160	So it's like a real arc.
3164160	3164920	He goes on.
3165200	3168640	Well, I liked it when he said something to the effect of like, give me a five
3168640	3172760	star review because cool people would do that and don't tend to give reviews and
3172760	3173880	a bunch of assholes.
3173880	3175000	Give me one star reviews.
3175000	3178320	So the fact is if you don't give me five star reviews, if you think I'm doing
3178320	3183280	good, like it, it, it, it, it fucks me up because everyone else is such a dick.
3183320	3185600	That's the truth, but it might less say that defensively.
3185800	3186080	Right.
3186080	3189160	But it might less be because people are dicks and more because he
3189160	3190360	encouraged them to do that.
3191880	3193320	Uh, right.
3193360	3198000	Well, what I look at, that's why I never, ever, ever have said in my life, even
3198000	3201600	before podcast culture, like I, yeah, I, I don't want to even go near that
3201600	3202320	feedback loop.
3202360	3206520	I like that idea of having to ask people to rate subscribe and like it stuff.
3206840	3212600	I, I'm, I, I don't fault anybody who has to participate in that currency because
3212600	3213160	that's what it is.
3213160	3214960	It's a currency, but I'm, I'm out.
3215000	3219000	Like to me, that's like a greenback dollar and I'm like a carpet bag and like,
3219040	3221560	like I'm that's, that's before my time.
3221560	3223480	I'm like, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not,
3223480	3226480	you're really all about, uh, reconstruction America.
3227360	3230080	Uh, the, uh,
3230120	3232720	what is your hangup with, uh, post civil war America?
3233640	3235960	I just think they could have done a better job of,
3236520	3240840	you know, I mean, you, you make a bed, then you, then you lie on it.
3240840	3243440	Why were there, why were there bags made of carpet?
3243480	3244680	Uh, I don't know.
3244680	3245640	What is a carpet bag?
3245640	3249320	It's just, it's, isn't it like a Northerner that's like coming down south to
3249320	3253400	like, uh, exploit, uh, just everybody or what is that?
3253400	3253640	Yeah.
3253640	3257760	Was that what it is to take over like, like by property because it's cheap,
3257760	3263120	because the whole, the whole, it's like a, it's a Northern elitist interloper.
3263160	3263480	Yeah.
3263840	3264200	Right.
3264200	3264960	So yeah.
3265320	3265800	Nailed it.
3265800	3269280	Yeah, that's the thing is like, like, like pod, podcasting is just like,
3269280	3271960	it is the, it's like this crazy Wild West like thing.
3271960	3275360	And like, so anybody who's like, Hey, you gotta, you gotta give me, give
3275360	3278080	me scalps or give me bottle caps or give me horse hooves.
3278080	3281360	Like I'm not, I don't judge anybody like, Hey, that's terrible,
3281560	3283240	but I'm also not trading in it.
3283880	3284760	Hey, do me a favor.
3284760	3287880	Give this podcast a one star review and then stick it up your ass.
3287880	3289000	And I'm never going to look at it.
3289000	3289760	I don't care.
3290080	3295160	Like that's my, that has to be my philosophy or I'd kill myself, but it does
3295160	3298040	suck because it's like, like, then you're like, well, now you just
3298040	3299680	removed the meaning from, right?
3299680	3300200	It's all this.
3300320	3301280	It's like the Uber thing.
3301280	3303960	It's the five star reviews have no, no fucking meaning.
3303960	3307200	It's so stupid because you just want to, you want to rate things.
3307200	3311440	When you get a, you take a lift and you forget to hit the stars
3311440	3313680	and you just say next, someone gasped.
3316280	3319280	So that doesn't mean that you gave them a zero stars.
3319280	3321240	That meant like you just skipped that process.
3321240	3325080	So one time I accidentally slipped and hit like two stars.
3325080	3327640	And I was like, Oh no, how can I fix this?
3327800	3330200	And I called like customer support or well, I emailed them.
3330880	3331920	They didn't get back to me.
3333720	3335600	It is, it gives me anxiety too.
3335640	3336720	I put up with a lot of shit.
3336720	3338120	Cause I don't want to be the reason.
3338640	3341920	I don't want to ding someone's five.
3341920	3343280	Not unless I intend to.
3343320	3343800	Right.
3344360	3347240	But if you accidentally just say, skip it and send to lift and you
3347240	3350760	don't give them any stars, that means that you skipped that step.
3350760	3351080	Right.
3351480	3354600	I think it doesn't mean that you gave them zero stars.
3355040	3358440	I hope I, I believe that's the way I do it all the time.
3358680	3358880	Yeah.
3358880	3361160	I keep picturing you guys with extra ears tonight.
3362800	3364400	Like Dan's been standing up.
3364400	3366400	I keep thinking like, what if Dan had four ears?
3366440	3367360	Well, what about six?
3367400	3368520	Are you, are you on mescaline?
3368520	3369440	What's going on right now?
3369680	3373240	That's what's so fucked up is like, I'm like, why is this my brain doing?
3374400	3374760	Okay.
3374760	3376320	So why is this my brain doing?
3377920	3379520	How many years do I have right now?
3379600	3381760	Four is I can't, I can't picture you as six.
3381760	3383080	I think cause you're straight on.
3384080	3385880	Like you're facing, you're facing me.
3385880	3386200	We'll see.
3386200	3387040	Now I can see sick.
3387040	3388120	That could be, that could be a thing.
3388720	3391000	You don't have a trick to make glasses tighter.
3391000	3391600	Do you that way?
3391600	3393600	I got to, I got to go to the thing, right?
3394000	3396520	Well, where do you want them tighter on your ears area?
3396560	3396920	Yeah.
3396920	3397240	Like that.
3397240	3398480	I mean, they just fall off my head.
3398480	3401000	They're like, there are two, there are spreads too wide.
3401040	3403520	I don't know what the terminology, the best podcast in the world.
3404120	3404600	It's good.
3404600	3407800	I think there are hinges are too are hyper extended.
3407800	3409080	You got like the plastic frame.
3409080	3411000	So I think you need like a hairdryer or something.
3411000	3411920	You can't just bend it.
3413440	3417920	You can take it to a, to a glass place and then they'll, they'll bend them in.
3417960	3418520	Definitely.
3418520	3422160	The, the place that sold me the glasses, not a glass place.
3422160	3423800	Not like, like, like a glass glass.
3423800	3425840	Glasses for a play fair.
3425840	3429440	Like, yeah, like a, like a, like, like Warby Parker.
3429480	3429960	Sure.
3430000	3432840	You can take one of their kiosks at Burning Man.
3432840	3434280	I use their home try on kit.
3435720	3436520	So how, okay.
3436520	3438320	Well, now tell us, we don't have a guest.
3438320	3442320	So, uh, uh, I only come here for the surprise guests.
3444080	3447640	Let's, let's, let's bring a surprise guest.
3448520	3453760	It would be a super special kind of Harman town live podcast fan.
3453760	3458000	The, the person that's like, I only come to this fucking thing because every once
3458000	3459400	in a while, Judd Apatow comes out.
3459400	3461120	I was going to say Judd Apatow.
3463720	3464120	Damn it.
3464120	3465440	That's 90 in a row.
3466160	3468200	I fucking God damn it.
3468200	3469240	These fuckers.
3470720	3472440	I was going to say Judd Apatow.
3474080	3475720	Should we, should we bring somebody up?
3475720	3477080	Should we, should we, should we try to?
3477080	3480080	No, well, first I want to talk to Spencer about his, uh, surgery.
3480120	3480720	Oh yeah.
3481720	3483680	Your, your hip is, uh, okay.
3483680	3484520	Or what's happening?
3484520	3484960	I think so.
3484960	3485520	I don't know.
3485640	3486600	I got surgery.
3486640	3488200	It was, uh, it was okay.
3488240	3490800	Oh man, surgery talk.
3493720	3496160	Can we, can we, can we get that drop of that?
3496160	3498560	Can you, can you take this seriously for a moment?
3498560	3503560	My man got his hip cut open.
3507440	3509120	Uh, yeah, I don't know.
3509400	3511600	It was, it was, it was a, it was a mess.
3511600	3513200	Hope you get what's right.
3513200	3514600	I wanted to do the low one.
3514800	3517760	I hope you got what's the low, low one.
3517760	3519000	Is that why it's being more male?
3522240	3522560	Okay.
3522720	3522960	All right.
3523040	3524240	That's a hat on a hat.
3526240	3526480	Nope.
3526880	3527680	That's sorry.
3527760	3528680	That's a hat on a hat.
3528720	3529120	Sorry.
3530280	3533840	I had on a hat that's called a hat, a hat, not a hat.
3534480	3536320	Yo, I'm a hat on a hat.
3537120	3541560	Yo, what'd you think about that comedic spin on top of spin?
3541920	3543320	Nothing ironic here.
3543400	3547840	Ask him, yo, someone starts to do something weird, then something
3547840	3549680	else's weirdness is beard.
3549880	3552680	So you got weird with a beard and that's double weird.
3552720	3554280	And that's just confusing.
3554600	3558640	You know, sometimes they call it a sock barrel in some different kinds of
3558640	3564600	writer rooms, it's an unnecessary connection that confuses people.
3565160	3570840	Like if your character's name is, uh, uh, uh, if your character has
3570840	3577160	cancer and then he's talking about the zodiac and then he's like, I'm a
3577160	3581360	cancer and then people are like, is that supposed to be a joke or what?
3581360	3588080	And they're like, you got to change it to cap record because otherwise
3588080	3589960	that's what they call a sock barrel.
3592400	3595040	But comedically we call it spin on top of spin.
3597720	3604120	Like if you're doing a hilarious, uh, Star Wars spoof, what are you doing?
3604120	3604680	What are you hitting?
3608720	3609240	Come on.
3609240	3611000	Just let Spencer talk about the surgery.
3611200	3613000	That's the point that's spin on top of spin.
3613160	3614560	I'm being the asshole.
3614560	3619120	I'm interrupting his surgery talk with like being a goof guy and the thing.
3619120	3621480	And then you're like, I hurt the gas pedal.
3621520	3622400	That's not a gas.
3622600	3624040	Well, that's two gas pedals then.
3626000	3627000	That could be really funny.
3627000	3627320	I don't know.
3627320	3635040	Or, or maybe, maybe, uh, or maybe you're hit.
3635040	3638680	Maybe if someone's already got their foot on the gas, then the pedal that
3638680	3640520	you're hitting is, is the break.
3641040	3642480	It's another way of looking at it.
3642840	3644920	Spin on top of spin hat on a hat.
3645120	3647160	Sock barrel, sock barrel.
3647240	3649960	What do you call it when Jeff's doing that and then someone makes
3649960	3651400	the lights all funky and crazy?
3651680	3654120	That is, uh, what is that?
3661720	3662360	He hates it.
3662840	3663600	He hates it.
3664560	3665360	It's pretty funny.
3667400	3668200	He's so mad.
3669360	3669920	I'm mad.
3671760	3677200	Uh, I must have resting mad face because I am fucking bored.
3677280	3678000	Um, all right.
3680480	3685160	I, I, I'm fantasizing about an iPad game.
3686440	3688000	Why, why is our show two hours?
3688000	3689040	I keep looking at the clock.
3689960	3692200	We have, we have 300 hours to go.
3692240	3692840	I don't know.
3692960	3694920	I mean, you know, show us so long.
3694960	3695360	Yeah.
3695360	3695960	Like, yeah.
3696240	3696280	Yeah.
3696280	3698800	I mean, who else has a two hour podcast?
3699040	3699520	Anybody?
3699760	3701120	Paul, uh, what's his name?
3701280	3704480	Pete Holmes has like a five hour podcast, but he's crazy.
3705920	3706600	That's fair.
3707360	3707720	Okay.
3707720	3709160	So your surgery.
3709200	3709560	Yeah.
3709560	3711720	So, uh, I don't know.
3716240	3721720	Um, so yeah, I was, I was gonna, like, my mom wanted to be involved and you
3721720	3723760	need someone who you care about.
3723800	3725200	No, that's not a prerequisite.
3725200	3733560	You need someone that you trust, um, to, to get you home from the thing
3733560	3736480	because you can't, and then they're supposed to watch you for 24 hours
3736480	3739640	apparently, but you can't just like call an Uber or taxi, apparently.
3739640	3742960	Cause like, if you die, like if you start dying in a taxi, I guess they'll
3742960	3744320	dump you out or something.
3744320	3744960	I don't know.
3745320	3749160	I don't know what the thinking is there, but, um, so it's like a cat
3749160	3750520	starts puking on the carpet.
3750600	3751040	Yeah.
3751120	3752600	And they're like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3752680	3753440	He's just lifting.
3754040	3758240	When my cat starts puking on the carpet, I try and stuff like a shirt under there.
3758280	3760160	So she starts freaking out and running away.
3760160	3763480	And I'm like, no, you stay here and barf like a good boy.
3764680	3767280	Um, so you went under general anesthesia and you have
3767280	3768440	to have somebody take you home.
3768480	3769200	Yeah.
3769520	3772280	I mean, I wasn't going to drive myself home, but lift is like a thing now.
3772280	3773800	It seems very easy to get someone.
3774240	3777920	I did have, when I, when I went under, there was a whole rigmarole
3777920	3778760	there that I didn't expect to be.
3778760	3781840	So, cause I was like, I just want to take a car and they're like, well, we
3781840	3785040	have a car service that we can provide, but it, uh, blah, blah, blah.
3785040	3787760	And all this stuff, it started to get so insulting that I was just like,
3787880	3788960	it's like, yeah, fine.
3788960	3792200	Like what, like, cause I always perceive that as like people, uh,
3792440	3796600	trying to act like I'm like, they're, they're like, well, you know, that's
3796600	3799720	going to cost you money and I always have the opposite reaction I should
3799720	3803120	have, which is like, I get mad and want to throw money at them to prove
3803120	3807120	that I'm like, you thought I was a clamp it, but I'm a Beverly hillbilly.
3809320	3811400	It's gotta be like a liability thing, right?
3811400	3813480	Which is always the worst reason for things to happen.
3813480	3815240	Take a left home from the, no, no.
3815240	3819200	So I got my mom, she was gonna, she was going to come over and take me there.
3819520	3823880	And so, um, I was like, okay, so be in my house at noon and then we could get
3823880	3826360	over, we could drive over and be there at one or whatever.
3826680	3831480	And then so like, um, I was taking a nap cause I was getting nervous and I was
3831480	3832800	like, I don't want to be conscious anymore.
3832800	3835200	This is thinking about stuff as a bad idea.
3835600	3839680	And so I took a nap and then I woke up and my mom like sent me a text at like
3840000	3843480	11 55 saying like, all right, I'm on my way.
3843600	3845280	And she lives like an hour away.
3845280	3847160	And I'm like, wait, what the fuck?
3847400	3848480	And then so I call her up.
3848480	3850120	I'm like, well, how far are you?
3850120	3851720	And she's like, I'll be there by one.
3851720	3851960	Right.
3851960	3854000	And I was like, no, we got to be there at one.
3854200	3857480	And then, uh, I start freaking out and then she's like, okay, I'm sorry.
3857480	3861880	And, um, then I had to get a lift over there and then she met me there.
3862160	3865000	And then we were kind of late, but it ended up being fine.
3865000	3868040	I thought like the surgery was going to start like shortly after one, but then
3868040	3870120	we had to wait for two hours for it to start.
3870120	3871240	And I was like, well, Jesus Christ.
3871440	3873720	And then I started getting like less ready.
3873720	3875400	Like I was like, it's two hours.
3875400	3877360	I'm not, I'm not, I'm not stand for this.
3877360	3878240	Like this sucks.
3878680	3880560	And I was just getting really nervous and stuff.
3880560	3885640	And then finally they, they took me in and, um, what they did normal stuff.
3885680	3886480	They, Oh yeah.
3886640	3890640	The anesthesia guy came by and he was like, uh, are you ready?
3890640	3892120	And I was like, I guess.
3892120	3893360	And he was like, you guess.
3893640	3897400	And I was like, yeah, I mean, I guess I've been waiting for like two hours.
3897400	3899040	And I started to like psych myself out.
3899040	3902880	And he was like, well, you know, usually people are always mad at the anesthesia
3902880	3904560	guy, save an earful for your doctor.
3904560	3907120	And I'm like, I'm thinking like, what the fuck are you talking about, man?
3907520	3911520	And then, and then, um, my mom like senses this tension or whatever.
3911520	3913200	And then she's like, are you ready?
3913200	3914440	And the guy's like, I guess.
3914440	3915520	And I'm like, what the fuck?
3915520	3917720	Like, this is totally unearned.
3917880	3921800	He has this chip in his shoulder because like, apparently he, he feels like he
3921800	3925400	takes a lot of lip from nervous patients who are about to get cut the fuck open
3925400	3926840	and killed and brought back to life.
3927080	3931120	It's like the anesthetics, like the highest paying job in the hospital, right?
3931120	3932920	Like he could fucking take a knee for this.
3932920	3934640	Like Jesus Christ, count your money.
3935000	3937800	Um, but it really pissed me off.
3937800	3939640	Like it put me in a terrible mood.
3939880	3943280	And, um, and then like the doctor came by and I was like, well, this guy is
3943280	3944040	doing just fine.
3944040	3945200	Like, I don't want to yell at this guy.
3945520	3948600	Um, not that I was yelling, like I was really just being nervous and
3948600	3950120	explaining that I was nervous.
3950120	3951320	And the guy took it as an insult.
3951520	3955240	Anyway, they, uh, they rolled me into the operation room and then the fucking
3955240	3959800	anesthetic guy, he, I started, I see him start to adjust, uh, just a drip, like
3959800	3961080	my IV drip and stuff.
3961080	3964040	And then he puts the thing over your face and he's like, this is just oxygen.
3964040	3964800	Just breathe normal.
3965000	3966080	And then I'm like, fucking out.
3966080	3970160	And like the whole time before I'm out, I'm like, I don't think this is just oxygen.
3970160	3972920	I think he's applied an anesthetic without telling me.
3972920	3974960	And I think I'm just going to lose consciousness randomly.
3975160	3976320	That's exactly what happened.
3976560	3977400	And it was, it sucked.
3977400	3979600	And then I came back up and I was like, wait, what the fuck?
3979600	3981840	That wasn't just oxygen, that fucking asshole.
3982040	3984400	I don't know if he was like, he was like punishing me.
3984400	3986880	Like he was being a dick because like he thought I was mad.
3987080	3991160	Anyway, I come to and it's fine and I'm in pain and it's fine.
3991200	3992560	It's like not that bad.
3992560	3994600	It's always surprising how like not bad.
3994640	3994920	I don't know.
3995000	4000000	Anyway, um, I was, I was pretty woozy and I threw up and then I was like, I think I'm
4000000	4000920	going to throw up again.
4000920	4003000	And they rolled me in a wheelchair over to the thing.
4003320	4007920	And I had to like, I had to like, like, you know, get myself over to the toilet,
4007920	4009320	like to throw up properly.
4009320	4012880	And they're like, Hey, you, you just project all voted from your wheelchair
4012880	4013720	all the way into that toilet.
4013720	4014320	That's impressive.
4014520	4015440	I was like, hell yeah.
4016560	4020080	And I explained to the, I explained to the nurse that I'm actually really good at
4020080	4023480	throwing up because, uh, when I used to smoke pot all the time, it would sometimes
4023480	4025320	make you throw up and I smoke pot in my car.
4025320	4027080	So I'd have to learn how to throw up while I was driving.
4027440	4027920	Oh boy.
4029000	4031800	I became really good at throwing up is, is the long and short of it.
4032080	4035840	I could throw up into my mouth and then fling it out of the car, like a catapult,
4036720	4039280	um, to kind of get it to clear the side of my car.
4039280	4041280	So it's not splattering all over the side of my car.
4042280	4046840	And I was telling this, this is a, this is a, I'm not supposed to do this, but I'm
4046840	4048640	just letting you know, I'm not married.
4048720	4049160	Right.
4050360	4054400	Panties were dropping and, uh, yeah.
4054400	4058440	So, uh, we went home and I, I wasn't feeling great and I was just shaking.
4058480	4061320	I, our whole family because has issues with the anesthetic.
4061320	4062480	So, uh, it wasn't great.
4062720	4066840	They gave me Percocet because I had bad reaction to Vicodin and the Percocet,
4066840	4068120	I wasn't feeling it at all.
4068120	4072560	Other than it just made me feel like I was like, uh, dizzy and losing my fucking
4072560	4072920	mind.
4073160	4077000	And so I kind of weaned myself off of that and just was taking Motrin and that
4077000	4080480	like, I don't know, the pain was a lot better than I expected to.
4080480	4082640	And I had to be on crutches for a while until Friday.
4082640	4085480	And then they said it didn't have to be on crutches, but like it kept being like
4085480	4087920	I would wake up in the middle of the night or my cat started vomiting.
4087920	4090600	And I would just react to the situation and not use my crutches.
4090600	4091920	And I would be like, Oh shit, I'm walking.
4091920	4092560	This is nuts.
4092880	4095720	Um, and then I would like realize I probably shouldn't be walking and stop,
4095720	4097040	but like it didn't feel better or anything.
4097040	4098680	So now I'm walking around, it's great.
4098720	4102560	Um, it's the worst thing is just, you have to ice yourself and then you have to
4102560	4103800	like lay in bed all this time.
4103800	4105040	And I was like, lose my fucking mind.
4105320	4108880	I've been going through some dark times, having like absolutely nothing to do
4108880	4110240	with like the pain I was in.
4110240	4112080	Just like, Oh, like nobody likes me.
4112080	4113560	I want to shoot myself in the dick.
4113920	4118120	Um, I know that speaking of my dick, um, one of the things that the doctor told
4118120	4122080	me way too late in the process was like, your, your, your, uh, your penis might
4122080	4126320	be numb for a few weeks and I was like, wait, this is not part of the deal.
4126400	4130040	I, I'd be like, I'll, I'll, I'll see you on the ice.
4130080	4130400	Yeah.
4132400	4135080	I mean, I'd be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, buddy.
4135120	4136120	You try and stop me.
4136200	4136640	Yeah.
4137200	4141360	What, what, why was your penis a casualty of, of that surgery?
4141400	4143000	I think just the anesthetic guy.
4143120	4143600	Okay.
4143680	4144040	No.
4144040	4151640	Um, he just, I guess, I guess Tony put in a request for the limp.
4151800	4152800	Um, was he right?
4152800	4154000	Did you, did you have a numb penis?
4154040	4154400	Yeah.
4154400	4155720	It was, it's been disturbing.
4155760	4160360	Um, I, I, I think I have a back, but it's not, I'm not, I'm not, that was very
4160360	4161400	unnerving at everything.
4161640	4164800	Um, but the idea is they, they, they get into your hip joint, right?
4164800	4169480	So they, they put a post between your legs and then they get you up on the thing.
4169480	4173240	And then they put like an, uh, like a handcuffs around your ankle.
4173440	4176400	And then they just like pull your leg really, really hard for the
4176400	4177680	entire duration of the surgery.
4177840	4179560	So it's mashing into your groin.
4179560	4181520	And then it's like the handcuffs are on your ankle.
4181520	4186080	So you have like, I had pretty sharp pains in both of those areas from the
4186080	4189440	surgery, because it's just like, you're being stretched as if on a rack for like
4189440	4191160	two hours while they're doing the surgery.
4191400	4192440	And so that wasn't great.
4192640	4195720	But, uh, yeah, Percocet, uh, was suck.
4195760	4197640	They can't put like velvet on those cuffs.
4197640	4197800	I mean,
4197800	4198120	Yeah.
4198120	4200400	Or like, they can't like move my dick out of the way.
4200400	4201200	Like what the fuck?
4201200	4203840	It seems like there's plenty of groin to go around.
4203840	4208160	Like, I don't, there's ways they could design, put a hole in it or something.
4208160	4208440	I don't know.
4208440	4210040	There's ways around this stuff.
4210040	4210440	I'm sure.
4210440	4214160	I mean, I guess they're doctors, but, uh, that's been my experience.
4214160	4219120	I'm, I'm finally, every day, like after the surgery, I felt like very noticeably
4219120	4222640	better and more mobile and more capable of moving around, like to the point, like
4222640	4227520	I was a bit shaky, um, even yesterday when I have weight on my left leg.
4227520	4232360	And now it's, uh, it's, I can walk pretty, it kind of hurts to walk without looking
4232360	4237400	stupid, but if I want, I can kind of walk mostly normal, um, without, without
4237400	4239760	looking like, you know, a person with a limp or anything.
4239760	4242680	And I, yeah, so it just, it was just weird.
4242680	4246040	I just felt like they were, uh, they were very businessy about it.
4246040	4247520	And it's like, well, come on, man.
4247520	4249120	I'm just, I'm freaking out over here.
4249640	4250000	Yeah.
4250040	4253840	We don't, uh, we don't, we don't, we don't, uh, heal people.
4253960	4255960	We just, uh, wait, how's that?
4256000	4256560	Wait, how's that?
4256560	4258160	Say we cut the bad stuff out.
4258320	4259040	We're not healer.
4259040	4259960	We don't have healers.
4259960	4260680	Wait, what is it?
4260720	4261200	Something?
4261280	4261800	I don't know.
4261800	4262800	That's clerics.
4263120	4267520	The medical business isn't about, it's, it's like an engineering thing.
4267520	4271520	It's like science, you know, it's not a, it's that there's no healing, uh, to it,
4271520	4276040	which, you know, if you, if you, it's thank God there's science involved for
4276040	4286080	sure, but, uh, yeah, but, uh, but it's also like, like a sick person is obviously
4286080	4289960	like, they have two things wrong with the minimum, the thing that's wrong with them.
4290080	4293960	And then the fact that things being wrong with you is like scary.
4294440	4300080	And we, we treat it like, uh, taking your car and like, oh, we have this replacement
4300080	4301760	part, do you have insurance and all this stuff?
4301760	4304440	And it's like people are, and then people are getting traumatized by the
4304440	4307120	experience of being treated like a car.
4307520	4307840	Right.
4308080	4310740	You're also very cagey about telling me the price of things.
4310740	4314600	Like I had to agree and set the schedule of the surgery and then agree that if I
4314600	4318440	changed the date of the surgery, I'd pay $400 before they would tell me the price.
4318440	4322540	And that's gotta be like one of the only places that happens where you don't know
4322540	4325620	like what you're paying before you agree to have paid it already.
4325620	4326960	It was just a very weird experience.
4326960	4329900	It really set everything up to be pissed off in myself.
4330060	4331180	Do you have insurance or?
4331340	4333500	Yeah, but I don't know how any of that shit works.
4333580	4335300	That's something they should teach in schools.
4335300	4338420	Like how insurance is supposed to fucking work because I just, I, you know,
4338420	4341360	people are like, Oh, you know, your premiums, your out of pocket, your total,
4341400	4344380	your maximum deductible, it's like, I don't know what the fuck you're talking
4344380	4346420	about insurance is another thing.
4346420	4346920	Exactly.
4346920	4354420	Like, uh, uh, rating systems, uh, that once it becomes institutionalized,
4354420	4357060	it loses all it's, it just doesn't make any sense anymore.
4357060	4357860	Just play around.
4357900	4365400	If I, if I, if a cop can pull you over and, and like put you in jail for not
4365400	4367540	having insurance, then it's not insurance anymore.
4367540	4370220	Now it's part of what allows you to drive a car.
4370580	4375700	It's like, uh, driver's license to colon first blood part three.
4377100	4381180	Like, like, like, and I understand I'm not like, I'm not so much of a hippie
4381180	4385300	that I'm like, we don't need insurance and we shouldn't be encouraged to have it.
4385300	4388740	I got, someone's explained that to me that if I hit someone in a car that
4388740	4393460	doesn't have insurance, they're fucking me over, I guess, but I don't know, man.
4393500	4395000	It's like, like people talk about that.
4395000	4396860	Like, it's like the most common sense in the world.
4396860	4398740	I'm like, you know, we're through the looking glass.
4398740	4403960	It may be common sense through the looking glass, but isn't there a more
4403960	4407380	common form of sense where you don't have to go through the looking glass
4407380	4409600	where it's like, you're just normal people.
4409600	4412960	Like, you know, there's gotta be a system we can figure out, right?
4413080	4415960	I mean, that's the thing is that they take, they take advantage of the
4415960	4417080	fact there is insurance.
4417080	4419320	So the people are like, Oh, you got to go into insurance.
4419320	4420440	And the insurance is like, I don't know.
4420440	4422200	Talk to the doctor and the doctor's like, I don't know.
4422200	4424720	The medical company says the bag costs $600.
4424720	4426080	And it's like, all of you are lying.
4426120	4430440	If, if, if everybody is, if what everyone is paying for is, uh, like some
4430440	4433320	weird bet that you might not get sick.
4433760	4439480	Um, then why does the end result of it always still that like rich people are
4439640	4442400	more allowed to get sick than poor people?
4442400	4446760	If that's the case, what can we just make a system where it's
4446760	4447880	called Medicare for all.
4447880	4448160	Right?
4448160	4453920	Like, like where you just go, Oh, you can't have any, it got a groundswell.
4453960	4457360	Yeah, it seems like the answer that it seems like any answer to that
4457360	4459320	question, like, why don't we do it this way?
4459320	4462960	The answer is because that would be horrific immediately, which is a
4462960	4464280	good, you know what I mean?
4464280	4470840	Like even like, even conservative, like hardcore capitalist, anti-socialist
4470880	4477320	healthcare people, I believe would not, they would take one look at a system
4477320	4481680	that was absolute draconian, like private healthcare system where like.
4482240	4487240	You going to your kid had a cold and you go into a hospital and it's
4487240	4490560	like a McDonald's menu, like cold $500.
4490560	4496880	Like, like the, the, and all the permutations of that system, like the
4496880	4500320	rich would also go, Oh no, no, no, we can't have that.
4500480	4500720	Right.
4500720	4503280	Well, I mean, I think that that is something people are doing.
4503280	4505320	It's just, can I pay out of insurance?
4505320	4507760	What's your, what's your day rate as a doctor?
4507760	4511320	And then those, those prices are actually, so it depends on the thing, obviously.
4511320	4514680	And I don't think really bad things, uh, it's good for, but I think that that's
4514680	4519480	something that has worked for people, which obviously you shouldn't go complete
4519480	4523400	capitalist enterprise, but skipping the insurance entirely and just paying the
4523400	4527440	doctor what the doctor needs to order the tools and stuff, I think actually does
4527440	4531160	help because it's not again, like three layers of middlemen all fucking you.
4531440	4535200	It just kind of feels like the whole healthcare thing was invented to make the,
4535200	4538640	one of the most important things in the world as boring sounding as possible.
4538640	4539360	I think yeah.
4539400	4542880	Where it's like, like, like, like, it sounds like, whoa, where, why do I feel
4542880	4547240	like I'm 14 and it's, we're talking about Nicaraguan freedom fighters.
4547240	4550960	Like I, like with Peter Jennings, like I, like, why is my brain turning off?
4550960	4554440	When, what we're really talking about is if you're poor, do you have a right to
4554440	4556080	live as long as a rich person?
4556080	4556720	Cause that's fine.
4556880	4558600	That's an exciting conversation.
4558840	4560320	That's some star Wars shit.
4560680	4562920	Like they want to obfuscate it.
4562960	4563760	It's yeah.
4563760	4567200	It's like, but it almost seems like everyone wants to, you know, like
4567200	4568760	everyone wants to make it complicated.
4568760	4571760	And, and it, but like, yeah, anyways, okay.
4571760	4572960	So that's that part of the show.
4573640	4576880	It's game of thrones game of thrones.
4576880	4577840	I, I binged it.
4578040	4579200	I got, I'm all caught up.
4579960	4580640	I'm all caught up.
4580680	4581480	He's all caught up.
4582920	4588680	Uh, that was really funny when they, when he goes, uh, Hey, brand the broken.
4588680	4589720	It's got a best story.
4589720	4591640	And then they bothered to cut to Aria Stark.
4591640	4597280	And she's like, like, it's crazy to include that shot when you're the one that
4597280	4599640	wrote that line of dialogue and shot it.
4599640	4602320	Like, it's like, like, and then you're in the other pay like cut to Aria.
4602320	4602840	That's great.
4602840	4603320	I love that.
4603320	4606720	Look, she's, she's, she's playing.
4606720	4608640	The curb your enthusiasm theme in her head.
4609280	4610160	Yeah, no, I love that.
4610160	4610840	Look, I love that.
4610840	4615080	Look, she, she's saying I have the best story ever.
4615080	4617400	I saved the universe.
4617720	4621840	I literally started as a little girl that wasn't allowed to play with arrows.
4621960	4626200	Saw my dad's head get cut off and ended up killing the devil for the crippled
4626200	4628760	brother that you just said has the best story.
4629800	4635360	He looks like John Oliver lost his glasses, uh, and had worse breeding.
4635360	4637880	And that's hard.
4637880	4638560	That's tough.
4638560	4638880	Wow.
4640280	4641520	Yeah, that was wow.
4642040	4646440	Why, who picked that fucking that was really punching out.
4646440	4648080	It's not that kid's fault that he got cat.
4648080	4650760	That's like when you cast kids and then you watch them go through puberty on
4650760	4652000	camera, like, what am I doing?
4652000	4654800	I was like, why wasn't that group of people that got to decide who's the
4654800	4657000	next king is because they're Lords.
4657040	4659680	Here are some people that have a better story than Bran.
4659720	4662360	No offense to Bran Hodor.
4663040	4666240	It has a more interesting story.
4666240	4669800	He's just not there either of the dragons, but let's go.
4669800	4670240	Let's go.
4670240	4671840	Let's go alphabetical order.
4672120	4678440	Aria, I would say most of the white walkers, just even the skeleton, CG
4678440	4682040	skeletons, they've gone through a lot of shit, but that skeleton horse, you know,
4682040	4688560	that motherfucker is like, he's like, it's a living makes, it's a living.
4689360	4694520	How about, how about, uh, uh, uh, Jon Snow's hairline that, that, that there's
4694520	4695800	some interesting stories there.
4695800	4696560	What the fuck?
4696560	4698000	That dude needs bangs.
4699280	4701840	Wait, that's, that's a weird take.
4701840	4705200	What I thought his hair was, I don't know why everybody, what I am so
4705200	4707120	distracted by that random hairline.
4707680	4708440	What do you mean?
4708840	4712960	He's got like a little, he's got like a little half committed count.
4712960	4717600	Chocula fucking widow's peak that comes, it's just like a little seismic burp,
4717600	4719920	like in the middle of his hairline, it's like off center.
4719920	4725240	Like it's not, it doesn't even, it's like, uh, are you trying, are you, are you
4725240	4729000	Eddie Munster or, uh, because that he has symmetry.
4729520	4729920	All right.
4729960	4734480	And purpose like, like I'm not, and again, it's like, it's genetics.
4734480	4737560	I mean, we're talking about just the natural thing going on there.
4737600	4739200	I'm saying, don't tie your hair back.
4739240	4741640	You gotta, you gotta, you gotta weird thing in your hairline.
4742120	4743320	Give that guy some bangs.
4744080	4747280	He'd look cute with bangs, but like, I think they show him at the end and he's
4747280	4752600	like, all right, time to go, uh, work at the, what was up with him walking off into
4752600	4754000	the woods with a bunch of children?
4754120	4755840	And is that a spinoff?
4756040	4757280	It, that's a spinoff.
4757280	4758640	It's like his job now.
4758680	4764840	It's like, uh, you should go work on the, you should go work at the night's watch
4764840	4765040	now.
4765040	4766560	And he's like, there's a night's watch.
4766880	4770520	And then, uh, and then there wasn't a night's watch and there, there, there
4770520	4773040	wasn't one, it's like, there's no wall.
4773520	4774880	So what the fuck is going on?
4774880	4780800	But his red haired friend who, uh, yeah, who said, no, I'm going to go up to the
4780800	4781680	pirate's life for me.
4781680	4787040	And then he's like working at the DMV and fucking like, Hey, want to talk about
4787040	4787520	pussy?
4787520	4788280	Oh, great.
4788960	4792520	That guy, his whole, his whole, because I can't get laid.
4792760	4796080	He's like, he's just kept talking about how he used to get a lot of pussy and now
4796080	4799360	he can't fucking, yeah, he talked too much about it.
4799600	4801120	I'm glad that lesson got learned.
4801120	4805240	I'm glad, I'm glad he wasn't like the guy that got laid.
4805240	4808960	The only thing that was good about it, uh, the game of thrones was that berries on
4808960	4812360	after it because that show was fucking a good, I still haven't watched Barry.
4812760	4813080	Huh?
4813120	4813840	I haven't watched Barry.
4813840	4814960	Oh, get up on that one, man.
4814960	4816000	It's fucking great.
4816000	4817120	I still got Atlanta.
4817120	4818600	I got to get through all through Atlanta.
4819760	4821920	I mean, alphabetical order.
4822040	4824360	I got nine seasons of Atlanta now.
4824360	4828360	And then you got to go to Barry and then, uh, cab, cab, cab.
4831360	4831960	What did you say?
4831960	4833760	Cash cab, cash cab.
4837120	4838000	Fucking Barry.
4838080	4839040	And then really good.
4839160	4842840	There's an episode where it's just a fight or is he finds, have you guys seen it?
4842840	4846360	Where Lillian, what's his, uh, God damn it.
4846720	4848120	That is a fucking goodie.
4848120	4850320	I don't know how they write a show like that.
4850640	4852240	It's really, really funny.
4852320	4852520	All right.
4852520	4854440	Well, don't make me mad at it before I watch it.
4855200	4856920	You can also be a good writer too.
4856960	4860480	I know, but you're starting to make me, you know, just don't push those buttons.
4860480	4865160	I'm saying this show breaks boundaries and, uh, pushes borders and you're a bad writer.
4865280	4865680	Okay.
4866920	4868640	Well, I don't like how he kills people.
4868640	4870840	I was watching an episode and he like killed someone.
4870840	4872320	I'm like, I don't like this.
4874360	4875520	Yeah, it's fucking weird.
4875520	4877080	I don't like that he's learning to act.
4877400	4878560	Yeah, it's just, yeah.
4878560	4881000	It's like, why am I supposed to root for his acting career?
4881000	4881600	He kills people.
4881600	4882360	That's not cool.
4882360	4886080	But, but then he goes into acting class and he's good because he just killed somebody.
4886360	4888400	But that's, but he shouldn't do that.
4891480	4893360	Uh, all right.
4893360	4894080	Let's play D&D.
4894680	4896000	Yeah.
4899960	4902920	Where would we even start Spencer saying that we did that?
4902920	4904080	Like how, how would that go now?
4904120	4905840	I mean, we could, we could talk about it.
4906200	4910160	I've always been of the opinion that a big part of the problem is you guys don't remember stuff.
4910160	4916120	And part of the reason you don't remember stuff is because we only play for like five minutes and we only play like once every three or four months.
4916120	4918840	And I think it's hard to remember five minutes, three months ago.
4918840	4921760	But, but I, I, I miss the structural problem.
4921760	4923320	I miss, I miss playing it.
4923320	4924360	So I want to play again.
4924560	4925720	Yeah, no, I miss it too.
4925720	4932640	But I just think that I, you know, to the extent that we want to actually get to a place where you guys feel confident and comfortable playing.
4932640	4936040	And I think that that's truly a big hurdle to, to leap or such.
4936080	4937480	Yeah, that would be a good start.
4937480	4941640	I, I'm willing to, I'm willing to, uh, let's do it for sure.
4941760	4948440	Uh, I have a prediction that, uh, uh, we can play for 20 minutes.
4948560	4954040	Uh, every episode and still we're going to be like, wait, what happened?
4954040	4955040	Where'd that guy go?
4955520	4961080	And, uh, and then every, every four weeks, a third of us, isn't going to be here.
4961080	4962200	Do you have your gear with you?
4962280	4965160	No, we don't need it.
4965360	4966560	We don't need to look at it.
4966960	4967640	I guess you do.
4967680	4971000	I mean, yeah, you, you want your, your, your character sheet for, you know,
4971440	4972520	Yeah, hypothetically.
4972520	4972760	Yeah.
4972760	4972960	Yeah.
4972960	4974560	But you'd have to do a good walk through it.
4974560	4976360	Like bring us back to where we were.
4976400	4976800	Right.
4977680	4978600	Let's, you want to try it?
4978640	4979480	I mean, sure.
4979920	4980400	Shall we?
4987120	4987760	Oh, good.
4987800	4988160	All right.
4988160	4988920	Bring them up, sir.
4989680	4990240	Who's got dice?
4990240	4991520	Do you have our character sheets as well?
4993920	4994560	What's your name?
4996040	4997000	Tommy P.
4998000	4999920	Hey, Levy, get, uh, get down here.
5000360	5000600	Oh yeah.
5000600	5001200	We need Levy.
5001320	5002760	It's your memorial day show.
5004560	5005400	Steve Levy.
5005920	5006640	There he is.
5006720	5008400	Levy.
5010880	5011320	All right.
5014680	5016880	Now, how should we start Spencer?
5016880	5021240	Do you want, you want music and you give us a, uh, a little breakdown?
5021400	5022320	Yeah.
5025160	5034480	Last time on Harbin Quest, our heroes, Harbin Quest comes to TV, not on the,
5034720	5035600	on the computer.
5035920	5040040	I saw someone like Harbin Quest season two, I think aired on comedy central
5040040	5041600	somewhere, like Europe or something.
5041600	5044480	I don't know, but I saw a screenshot blew my mind.
5045080	5046320	We're not getting money from that.
5046320	5046560	I know.
5046560	5046880	Shit.
5046880	5048040	There were, where's my money?
5049240	5053760	The guys, the people they had, they had left, they had left the town.
5053760	5056280	What was that town Fightsville or some shit?
5057000	5060400	They left Fightsville because they felt like they did a bad job.
5060400	5064160	And then they met a cult that did exercises and they did exercises.
5064160	5067840	And then they left the cult and found another cult that was summoning a
5067840	5070840	demon and then they helped them summon the demon.
5071240	5074200	And then the demon came out and started killing people.
5074200	5075320	And they're like, well, this sucks.
5075320	5075960	Let's leave.
5076280	5079440	And then the church militant came and slaughtered the demon.
5079800	5082720	And then, um, then they were like, well, yeah, we're a lot worse than
5082720	5084480	this than everyone else is.
5084720	5086000	So let's stop doing this.
5086000	5086960	Let's be a farmer.
5087280	5091240	And then they went to go be a farmer, but they didn't actually go anywhere.
5091240	5093320	I think they were deciding to do that.
5093640	5099680	And so we rejoin our heroes now, or in the future, depending on which they
5099680	5105040	choose at a point at which they had been farming or made a decision to start
5105040	5109800	farming, and we're going to go about doing that now.
5120040	5120880	You got your dice.
5121240	5122200	I got my dice.
5122200	5122680	All right.
5122760	5128720	So, all right, I examine my surroundings.
5128800	5129200	All right.
5129200	5131200	You're in a, you're in an empty field.
5131200	5132840	You see a bunch of slaughtered cultists.
5132880	5133160	Oh, wait.
5133160	5137600	Well, do you want to be farming or do you want to be deciding to be farming and go
5137600	5138960	to search out a farm to farm?
5138960	5142880	I say we're kind of half, like a half heartedly farming right now.
5142960	5143480	All right.
5143840	5148400	You found the town of Potos Donos, the farming village.
5148440	5150320	There's about, it's not much of a farming village.
5150320	5154480	There's like six farms and there's only, there's only a handful of people.
5154680	5155920	You haven't really met them.
5155920	5158040	You just kind of, you rolled up on a farm.
5158160	5160520	You killed a fucking ghost that was haunting the farm.
5160720	5162800	And then you were like, well, I'm going to, I'm going to take this farm.
5162800	5164080	Now you started farming.
5164080	5166200	It feels like the earth had been salted or something.
5166200	5169560	So you're making a really hard time, hard time, uh, getting crops out.
5169560	5173680	But this is your first harvest in the first, in the first half of your farm.
5173680	5176400	And your other half of the farm is just ready to be planting.
5177320	5179320	And I'm Chad, the fireliker.
5179400	5180560	We have diarrhea, Jr.
5180560	5187960	And Harmon is Carlos, Carlos, the unimaginative, Carlos Johnson, Carlos Johnson.
5190200	5194080	And give me, cause it's been so long, give me class and, uh, and, uh, he's a
5194080	5195760	cleric, diarrhea, Jr.
5195760	5197960	Is a fighter and you're a druid.
5198080	5199480	I'm a, I'm a, yeah, I'm a numb druid.
5199840	5204480	Potato basket coming up.
5204480	5210160	Uh, guys, uh, not very full.
5210160	5213440	Does it, does it, does this seem kind of diminishing?
5213440	5218040	Like we used to be fighters and like we were on, on the, on the quest.
5218040	5220520	Now we're just, we're just growing potatoes.
5221240	5228200	Well, for me, the big relief is, uh, you know, just knowing what I'm trying to do.
5228840	5230840	You know, even if I'm, yeah, okay.
5230840	5232200	I'm not the best potato farmer.
5232200	5234460	I didn't think I was going to be, but, you know,
5234500	5239020	I felt like a bigger failure, uh, handling people's lives than these potatoes here.
5239020	5240860	We, we were bad at the other thing too.
5240900	5243020	Like, come on, let's talk.
5243020	5243940	Will we prepare dinner?
5244140	5244460	Come on.
5244460	5244900	Guess what?
5244940	5245820	Guess what's for dinner.
5248100	5249300	I'll wash you peel.
5249420	5249860	Okay.
5250580	5253300	This way we're not, we're not really, we're not hurting anybody, but
5253300	5254620	ourselves with these potatoes.
5254660	5255340	Amen.
5255380	5258380	I take out my, uh, my dagger and I start peeling potatoes.
5259220	5263900	I'm piling them on a plate ready for peeling, scrubbing them with a rag and
5263980	5267700	a bucket of warm water that I had heated up from the river.
5268140	5273580	Oh, are we, are we doing a potato latkes with a side of mashed potatoes tonight?
5274300	5274500	Here.
5274500	5275260	Why don't we do this?
5275300	5277860	You dunk each potato in the water.
5278060	5278540	Okay.
5278580	5281860	And then, and kind of give it a pre scrub, hand it off to me.
5281860	5283740	And then I'll, we got like assembly line.
5283740	5284940	I'll hand it to him for peeling.
5285020	5285460	Okay.
5287860	5288820	Thank you.
5289140	5290020	Good job.
5290900	5292620	Nothing like a clean potato.
5293020	5296140	Nothing like a, nothing like a perfectly peeled potato.
5296540	5296940	Yeah.
5298620	5299300	Gentlemen.
5304260	5306660	I appreciate you guys doing this with me.
5307060	5307500	Yeah.
5307540	5319260	I mean, but, uh, Carlos, you, you had like ambitions like to, like to be a, like
5319260	5326780	a cleric that wanted to like purify the world and remove evil and get rid of all
5326780	5328060	demonic stuff.
5328060	5329260	And now what are we doing?
5329260	5330340	We're fighting the war.
5330340	5331300	You want something more.
5331300	5332580	It hurts to be bad at it.
5333020	5333420	Right.
5334260	5334940	It's terrible.
5336220	5337860	I mean, is there a way to retry?
5337860	5340900	Like they kind of put our, I feel like that's what babies do.
5340900	5343940	Like, like when they're bad at something, we go, you can try again.
5343940	5345420	And they're like, I'm kind of old.
5345820	5349100	And I was a priest and it's like, ah, you keep killing people and not
5349100	5349980	knowing what you're doing.
5350460	5355140	And like, like at some point, if you're saying to that guy, uh, oh, come on, try
5355140	5357060	again, it's like, it's enabling.
5357060	5357260	Okay.
5357260	5359940	So you're saying just potato farming is good enough for you now.
5360060	5362740	Like you're, you're, you're, which is fine.
5363300	5364940	If that's what you're okay with.
5364980	5369820	Well, I'd like to see the day when I really hungered for adventure, I guess.
5369820	5371100	I mean, I haven't seen that day.
5371100	5373380	Like I'm still recoiling from being so bad at it.
5373380	5376060	I mean, do you think that that demons don't exist anymore?
5376060	5383260	That, that, that you, that the world doesn't have, come on.
5383260	5384980	After all the stories we've been through.
5385060	5386620	I know exactly.
5386660	5388500	Yeah, I know demons exist.
5388540	5388940	Okay.
5388980	5391460	So you, and you're, you're, you're, you're over it.
5391500	5395420	You're, you're, you're good to go now that you like, you're happy.
5396180	5396740	You're happy.
5397260	5398140	Tell me you're happy.
5398740	5400660	Look me in the eye and say that you're happy right now.
5400660	5401700	I can't tell you that.
5402780	5405620	That doesn't, that's not, I wasn't happy before either.
5406140	5407060	I was anxious.
5407860	5411500	I'm trying to, I'm trying to find the thing that makes me happy, but more
5411500	5414060	importantly, also hurts the least people.
5414540	5415780	Like I want to help the world.
5416140	5417780	I feel like I was kind of getting in the way.
5418980	5421180	Dario, are you going to say something in your mind, young man?
5422380	5426940	I mean, look, it's, it's not as fulfilling, but this, this potato farming
5426940	5428420	really is scratching an itch for me.
5430740	5432060	I'm going to put these in the oven.
5432700	5433860	I'm going to invent the oven.
5434020	5436340	Damn.
5437540	5440260	I'm going to, I'm going to put these in the equivalent of an oven.
5440660	5441460	It's a kiln.
5441740	5442780	It's a potato kiln.
5443420	5444020	Hell yeah.
5446740	5450540	I, uh, I, I cast a fireball to heat up the oven faster.
5450900	5451820	You do that.
5453700	5455980	I mean, I still have, I still have powers.
5456020	5456900	Yeah, me too.
5459340	5460540	I heal the potatoes.
5460660	5461780	Oh, they're raw again.
5462380	5463740	Now you, now you gotta cook them.
5464460	5465340	They're unpeeled.
5466300	5466540	Yeah.
5466540	5470900	The farm didn't have ready access to water and Dan's ability to create water
5470900	5472980	was instrumental in growing the potatoes.
5474740	5476220	That's just a bit of backstory.
5476300	5480900	That's, I think we're wasting our talents right now.
5480900	5484220	I think, are there rival farming families?
5484340	5486260	There's one rival farmer.
5486580	5487420	What was her name?
5488100	5488700	Ketamine.
5490620	5491180	All right.
5491740	5496060	She's a hard worker and she's really, uh, competitive about farming,
5496060	5499140	which like, you don't have to be in like the market's not saturated enough
5499140	5502300	for that to be a thing, but she's like, she's always been doing that.
5502540	5505860	And she's better than you because she's like, she comes from a line of farmers
5505860	5507660	and she has a much better farm on a much better.
5507660	5509140	What's her crop of choice?
5509500	5510260	Tobacco.
5511460	5513100	I think she's delightful.
5513900	5516460	I met her on Tuesday and she's fantastic.
5516460	5517540	She's a fire plug.
5517580	5518300	You guys sit down.
5518300	5519580	You're going to, these are going to go cold.
5521180	5530260	I got to say, you knocked them out of the park.
5530260	5532900	You got to, they're growing all right.
5532940	5535220	Yeah, no, it's the, they're good.
5535260	5538740	But you're not, you're not jealous of that tobacco money that the ketamine.
5540420	5542860	Of course, she's going to be better at farming than us.
5542860	5543780	She's been at it forever.
5543780	5545980	We should make friends with her and learn to farm better.
5545980	5546220	Okay.
5547900	5548980	She might be single.
5549020	5551780	You hear a knock, you hear a knock at your door.
5552580	5553500	We hear a knock at the door.
5553500	5553980	Yeah.
5554700	5556500	I get up and go in and answer the door.
5556780	5560780	Um, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a man that's a raccoon man.
5560820	5562340	He's like, uh, he's a beast man.
5562340	5563140	He's a raccoon.
5564340	5567220	That's like, yeah, there's all sorts of fantastical races.
5567380	5568700	You've seen him around town.
5568980	5572540	You notice, you notice his name or you know, his name's Tom and he's
5572540	5573700	a shopkeeper in the area.
5573700	5575340	He sells all sorts of supplies.
5575580	5577860	It's like, Hey, it's so glad you're glad you're settling in.
5577860	5579540	Looks like first harvest is coming.
5579860	5582820	Uh, you do owe a lot of money for this property.
5583900	5585700	So, I mean, that's no big deal.
5585700	5589260	You know, we, we, we just want people to live here, but over time you might want
5589260	5592380	to be paying, paying that off, come up with a payment plan.
5592420	5595820	Well, we, we have a lot of gold from our last, uh, quest showing.
5596420	5596900	Sure.
5596940	5598140	Is that Tom out there?
5599820	5600260	Yeah.
5601620	5601980	Yeah.
5601980	5602900	I'll bring them in.
5602900	5603860	Gaff some potatoes.
5603860	5604460	Come on.
5604860	5606700	Tom, come in, have a potato.
5606740	5606940	Yeah.
5606940	5607500	Hungry.
5607700	5608020	Yeah.
5608020	5608260	Yeah.
5608260	5608700	Sure.
5608740	5609380	How's it going?
5609420	5611220	Don't go digging in the garbage cans.
5613380	5613780	He's sorry.
5613780	5614460	That's racist.
5614460	5615180	That's racist.
5620460	5622780	It's like, this is, this is some crops you got going.
5622780	5624740	These are, this your, this your yield, huh?
5625020	5625300	Yeah.
5625300	5625500	Yeah.
5625500	5627460	I mean, obviously we're not that good yet, but
5627500	5628180	Oh, that's fine.
5628180	5629660	No one's is when they just start.
5629660	5632620	You know, I started selling stuff when I was a kid.
5632620	5633580	I didn't know what to charge.
5633660	5635820	Do, do we buy this land from you?
5635940	5638620	No, no, but I, I do own most of the land.
5638620	5639700	I don't mind it.
5639700	5643140	And I'm not going to be a bad guy about it, but I mean, you know, it's just,
5643180	5644740	the land is like a big thing.
5644740	5646380	You're, you don't seem to be Lord.
5646380	5649740	So like, you know, we didn't charge you for killing the ghost.
5650220	5650860	Yeah.
5651620	5653300	Well, I could give you a big discount.
5653300	5654380	That's a, that's a great point.
5654860	5655740	I'll knock off.
5656100	5656580	He does.
5656580	5662020	He pulls out an abacus and he starts doing a thing like, yeah, take 10% off of that.
5662060	5662700	That's fine.
5662700	5663020	Yeah.
5663100	5664380	Give me a, get our abacus.
5666780	5667860	That's a coincidence.
5667860	5674020	Cause we are also having a deal on ghost killing and, uh, I just make the beads
5674020	5677740	the same, uh, looks like even Steven.
5683020	5685500	I don't want to be a grumpy guest, but there was a buyer on this
5685500	5686620	house, even with the ghost.
5686620	5689460	So I don't feel like it's that much of a value, but someone
5689460	5690980	wanted your haunted house.
5691060	5691580	Yeah, man.
5691580	5694780	The farm from, from properties going from, this is a nice neighborhood.
5694780	5696860	You think their potatoes taste this good.
5697500	5699380	I, they don't, I can't tell.
5699740	5701500	I got to make a calculated assessment.
5701540	5703740	That's part of being a entrepreneur.
5703780	5705060	Let's give this guy a potato.
5705660	5705980	All right.
5705980	5708380	Look like we need to sell some potatoes.
5708380	5708940	Obviously.
5708940	5709140	Yeah.
5709140	5709820	Over time.
5709820	5710140	Yeah.
5710140	5711460	No, no, you guys are farmers.
5711460	5712860	This is like in your wheelhouse, huh?
5713740	5715060	I mean, we're learning.
5715060	5715860	We're getting there.
5715860	5716420	I'm sorry.
5716420	5719700	You're comparing us to this person that I don't believe exists that
5719700	5721420	wanted to buy a haunted house.
5721780	5722340	Oh yeah.
5722340	5722780	They did.
5722780	5723700	Her name is Kagura.
5723700	5725140	She loves busting ghosts.
5725580	5727780	Actually, you know, I think she's busting a ghost right now.
5728260	5729900	You hear outside in your farm area.
5729900	5730740	You hear a fire.
5731500	5734060	Well, there's a fire.
5734100	5735060	You hear a fire.
5736980	5741580	Getting up, putting my napkin down and leaving my silverware and going outside.
5741660	5743060	I follow Carlos.
5743180	5744260	I love fire.
5744260	5747660	So I'm excited because I'm Chad, the firelacker.
5747700	5748220	Yeah.
5749140	5749500	All right.
5749500	5753980	So you go out back to where your farm is and, uh, uh, not, not much of your farm,
5753980	5759620	but say about five feet of your farmland, uh, has been replaced by a giant
5759620	5764300	tree and that tree is on fire and outside of that flaming tree, no, inside
5764300	5765900	of that flaming tree, you see a ghost.
5765900	5766820	It seems to be trapped.
5766820	5767780	It seems like a wraith.
5767780	5769300	You guys know about ghosts a little bit.
5769300	5769820	It's a wraith.
5770180	5775420	Um, and arguing about that wraith is a, is a, is a, is a woman who looks like a
5775420	5779860	druid and, uh, she has like a mask on the side of her head, like, uh, like
5779860	5784380	a tribal mask and she's yelling at a small mole, a mole man.
5785060	5785740	They're arguing.
5785740	5789700	They're like, the mole man's like, I can't, I don't care what you want to do with
5789700	5790460	these ghosts.
5790740	5793100	This is not a place for you to be used to your magic.
5793100	5794100	This is someone's property.
5794300	5797700	And she's like, I can't, I can't be told when or where to bus ghosts.
5797700	5799180	This is just my, my calling.
5799220	5801260	You need the buck ghosts gone anyway.
5801580	5802860	So they're arguing about that.
5804100	5804780	She's a druid.
5804940	5805220	Yeah.
5805220	5806460	She's, she looks like a druid.
5806500	5807700	So I'm a druid too.
5807780	5808220	Oh yeah.
5808220	5810180	And druids know a secret language.
5810260	5814260	I, uh, I, uh, I go, Hey, uh, what's, what's, what's the beef?
5814340	5815460	They're like, Hey, new guys.
5815580	5818900	I was tracking this wraith, tried to catch it in the spirit tree.
5818940	5820220	You know, I conjured up a tree.
5820420	5821380	Um, I'll help you.
5822100	5823420	I got this tied up.
5823420	5825420	You want to take care of this mole, get him off my back.
5825460	5826180	That'd be cool.
5826660	5830180	Uh, I sense motive on the, uh, on the mole.
5834140	5834540	All right.
5834900	5838780	The mole he's just, he's like a classic, uh, what do you call it?
5839340	5841860	Like he, he loves laws and rule of order.
5841860	5844420	And he's just, he has a lot of fastidious laws.
5844580	5846900	You saw him when he first moved to the town, he wouldn't shut up
5846900	5847860	about laws and stuff.
5847860	5849940	He's telling you, you're always fucking up, but he doesn't really do
5849940	5851540	much about it other than show up and yell.
5851820	5853980	And so, uh, he's, he's been doing that.
5853980	5856740	And he's like, this is an unauthorized druid magic zone.
5856740	5858740	You can't be putting trees up in places.
5858740	5861220	And that's kind of his angle is she's infracting the law.
5861220	5863740	And she's like, you know, Oh, we've got to kill this thing.
5864220	5867900	It's like, was this thing here before she put the tree here, or is
5867900	5869460	the tree containing the thing?
5869740	5870820	I'm a little confused.
5870820	5872220	She was chasing the race.
5872220	5875420	So she was chasing across your farm and she finally caught up to it
5875420	5877380	and cast this tree to catch it.
5877380	5878660	Well, I think I can settle this.
5878660	5879700	This is our property.
5879700	5882780	And, uh, it sounds like if we give permission for there to be a wraith
5882780	5887260	tree on it, uh, uh, then, then there's no lobbying broken.
5887460	5890620	Well, that's all well and good, but I believe this is Tom's property.
5890620	5891620	So maybe we should get him.
5891620	5892260	Is he around?
5892420	5894820	Tom's actually, he kind of wandered out to see that.
5894820	5896140	And he's like, Hmm.
5896180	5897100	Oh, raccoon Tom.
5897180	5897540	Yeah.
5897580	5897940	Yeah.
5897980	5899900	Well, he w he was just eating our potatoes.
5899900	5901940	And I mean, we're kind of subletting.
5902460	5904780	Tom's like, well, ghosts don't help anyone really.
5904780	5906660	So I think I'm okay with this.
5906900	5907300	Yeah.
5907940	5909340	Thanks for the wraith tree.
5909900	5910540	Oh yeah.
5910900	5912380	It grows wraith berries.
5913980	5915940	So he's, this is safe now here.
5915940	5917860	This is, well, it's on fire.
5917860	5920940	So you got to contain that, but the fire will burn out along with a wraith.
5921020	5922380	Should be good pretty soon.
5922420	5923060	Oh, okay.
5923140	5924060	Unless it escapes.
5924100	5927100	Didn't you, uh, Carlos, didn't you, uh, create water?
5927900	5929260	Uh, yes.
5931220	5932180	What was that Spencer?
5932300	5932860	That's a spell.
5932860	5933580	It's a cleric spell.
5933580	5934140	Create water.
5934180	5934540	Okay.
5934700	5935260	Sure.
5935500	5937300	Uh, sure.
5937300	5938220	Let's see if that works.
5938260	5943780	And if I put out the race tree fired, that's not what's keeping the wraith in it.
5943940	5945620	Well, that's actually, yeah, it is.
5945620	5947220	So let's wait for the wraith to die.
5947220	5948500	And then, then we get that.
5948500	5949700	We're going to wait for the race to die.
5949900	5950300	Okay.
5951380	5952860	What do you guys want to talk about?
5955380	5956820	The mole's pissed and leaves.
5956900	5959220	It kind of burrows in the ground and it grows away.
5960540	5960940	Thanks.
5961180	5965500	We understand the, um, what you were trying to do.
5966580	5969260	Tom's like, do you know about the church of Corlax?
5971820	5972740	I don't believe we do.
5973300	5973820	Oh man.
5973820	5974780	Corlax is great.
5974780	5975900	He, uh, Corlax.
5975940	5976500	Oh yeah.
5976820	5979020	He exchanges goods and services for money.
5980060	5981740	Oh, check this out.
5982460	5983420	He has a church.
5984100	5984580	Yeah.
5985060	5986700	I'm a worshiper, right?
5986820	5990580	He, he kind of, he starts praying and throws some coins on the ground and the
5990580	5994300	coins poof away and then in this place is like a small wooden toy.
5994620	5996060	He's like, that's some God, huh?
5996140	5996620	Wow.
5996700	6000300	That's depending on how much you like wooden toys.
6000300	6000540	Yeah.
6000540	6001260	That's a great God.
6001420	6002380	I love toys.
6002900	6003900	Well, you could have that.
6003980	6006900	Just take that on me and I won't add it to your total.
6007700	6008980	Thank you.
6009100	6009660	Yeah.
6010020	6012340	What kind of toy did you get there?
6012380	6013860	It's a wooden toy.
6014340	6015660	What kind of toy is it, Steve?
6015780	6025460	It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, you know.
6026420	6027780	What kind of toy is it, Jeff?
6029060	6031020	It's a, it's a, it's a boat.
6031740	6032260	There you go.
6032380	6033380	It's a wooden boat.
6034260	6035460	That's super useful.
6035980	6036620	It is.
6037140	6041500	It's a fine line between a toy wooden boat and a cup, right?
6045140	6047820	It looks like it can hold a volume of liquid.
6051140	6052220	Could come in handy later.
6052260	6053220	We could use it as a cup.
6055620	6056460	Could use it as a cup.
6056500	6057100	You could whittle it.
6057100	6058700	Is Tom still there?
6059060	6060540	Tom's, Tom's hanging out.
6060540	6060740	Yeah.
6060740	6061620	It hasn't been too long.
6061620	6064140	Tom, tell me, tell me about the church of Corallax.
6064140	6067580	Cause we, we, we dabble in the religious arts ourselves.
6067620	6070580	Uh, what, what, what goes down with the church of Corallax?
6070620	6073420	The symbol is a brass trihelical knot.
6073620	6079700	Um, congregates engage in rituals that exchange monetary and, uh, uh, good,
6079700	6081180	like, uh, what do you call it?
6081220	6084180	Trade goods for services and other goods.
6084180	6085540	So it's not all wooden toys.
6085620	6087180	You guys do other things.
6087260	6088500	No, you could get seeds.
6088500	6091940	You could get, uh, you know, you get demons who do stuff for you.
6092060	6093260	Potato seeds.
6093420	6093740	Yeah.
6093740	6095100	Like, uh, all sorts of stuff.
6096220	6097620	The God just likes commerce.
6097660	6099700	Aren't potato seeds just other potatoes?
6099700	6100340	That's true.
6101900	6102140	Yeah.
6102860	6105260	There's also the fucking worst potato farmers.
6105260	6106820	Well, we're not good yet.
6106820	6107620	What happened?
6108020	6109700	We don't even know how potatoes work.
6110460	6112580	We're not fucking good yet.
6112660	6113020	Right.
6113020	6116700	Like, were you a good adventurer before you were an adventurer?
6116700	6117140	You know what?
6117140	6119380	I thought I had potential.
6120020	6121940	Well, we have potato potential.
6123260	6124980	Yeah, I play on words.
6124980	6125620	I just came up.
6125620	6131740	I, uh, I slap I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm homesteading now.
6131740	6134140	So my dad instincts are kicking in.
6135460	6135940	All right.
6135980	6140940	I'm, do you have, uh, give me a good potato joke, like a dad potato joke.
6141020	6146380	Uh, how does that, why, why are potatoes so good at democracy?
6147500	6147780	Why?
6147820	6149460	Because the eyes always have it.
6150900	6151900	Oh shit.
6152900	6159340	They have eyes for those, for our urban listeners, potatoes before they come to
6159340	6167500	your, your, uh, hormone, uh, uh, GMO, uh, uh, kiosk, you know, where I come from in
6167500	6171940	Wisconsin potatoes have a little warts all over them that you have to pluck
6171940	6176820	off called eyes, I think I believe those are just the roots, root tendrils.
6176820	6183460	That's the potato saying, please let me be a potato.
6183460	6184020	Let me live.
6184020	6184700	Don't eat me.
6185460	6190300	And then you say, peel off the eyes of a potato before you, before you eat them.
6190300	6190620	Right.
6191260	6192660	Do you ever feel guilt about that?
6193740	6195100	Now that I describe it, I do.
6195100	6195500	Yeah.
6197380	6201980	Yeah, but what are we doing if we're not just murdering potatoes all the time?
6201980	6203700	I think, well, I look.
6203700	6207660	Well, they are, won't they?
6207900	6208420	Am I right?
6210140	6214260	Um, well, uh, Tom, uh, thanks for coming by.
6214300	6215260	Thanks for the toy.
6215620	6218860	Um, thanks for the, uh, information about your religion.
6219340	6219820	Yeah, man.
6219820	6220860	Come by anytime.
6220900	6221860	I'll pray something up.
6222860	6223180	Great.
6223780	6225340	And, uh, how do we do it?
6226060	6227460	Uh, how do we pray things up?
6227660	6229140	You can't do it super easily.
6229140	6233140	It takes like a couple of circles of initiation to learn the rights and stuff,
6233140	6234180	but we could talk about that.
6234180	6237660	I mean, I charge, of course, for those training courses, but here we go.
6237700	6238100	Okay.
6238100	6239220	Thank you very much, Tom.
6239620	6240780	This is my religion.
6240820	6242060	This is my religion.
6242340	6244220	Yeah, we're going to, we'll, we'll come by.
6244220	6245940	We're going to come by next Sunday.
6245940	6247780	Don't join the cults.
6249020	6250180	We just moved here.
6250220	6250860	Okay.
6250860	6254100	Just, well, you, but you think they'll have horses.
6255260	6256340	Oh, we got horses.
6257100	6258380	Can you conjure horses?
6258420	6258780	Oh yeah.
6258780	6259420	I got horses.
6259420	6260540	What's the name of this God?
6261540	6262460	Corlax.
6262500	6263300	Corlax.
6264740	6265580	But it's random.
6265580	6266860	You can't just get horses.
6267980	6270780	No, you got to pray for them and pay the requisite price.
6272260	6272700	Okay.
6273020	6273980	25 GP.
6277660	6278060	20th.
6278660	6279340	GP.
6279460	6280780	GP gold pieces.
6280860	6283260	Oh, 25 DP.
6283260	6284780	That's a very, that's a lot of.
6284780	6286180	It's a very different currency.
6287300	6288820	Chad, get your head out of the gutter.
6289740	6290620	We'll think about it.
6290620	6291780	Tom, the landlord.
6291780	6292460	Goodbye.
6292460	6293300	Thank you.
6293340	6294100	See you, man.
6294340	6295820	We're very friendly tenants.
6295820	6296340	Thank you.
6296340	6297660	Thanks for living here.
6297660	6298300	This is cool.
6298340	6301740	Look, I'm not for religion, but I love horses and toys.
6301740	6307260	So well, I look, you can do whatever you want, but I don't, I just, look, I'm
6307260	6316540	trying to get rid of him and, uh, I, I, uh, look, you guys, maybe we should all
6316540	6318540	split up into different potato farms.
6319700	6322220	What I just do so much.
6322260	6324700	You know, you're always asking, should we be potato farming?
6324700	6326180	That can't be the right way to do it.
6329100	6332900	Are you asking me if I'm satisfied being a failed potato farmer?
6332900	6333780	The answer is no.
6333780	6340700	I, I'd rather be, I'd rather be, uh, I'd rather be trying to kill demons.
6340740	6341020	Yeah.
6341140	6343700	So, well, you know, maybe this is.
6346340	6347100	Not Tom.
6348100	6349260	Is Tom still there?
6349380	6350700	He's with an earshot of yelling.
6350700	6351140	Tom.
6352340	6352780	Yeah.
6352780	6357500	Hey, hey, uh, you got any demon trouble?
6358740	6361300	Uh, not now.
6361340	6362100	I mean, okay.
6362100	6363540	Fuck go away.
6363740	6364140	This guy.
6364140	6364460	Okay.
6364860	6366460	I, you were right.
6366500	6368220	Carlos, you, I was wrong.
6368220	6368660	You were right.
6368660	6369340	Maybe tomorrow.
6369340	6370340	That guy didn't have.
6371420	6372860	There's a nor'easter coming in.
6373740	6375180	We're going to catch our death of cold.
6375180	6376020	Let's get inside.
6376260	6377260	Tell some stories.
6377660	6378220	Okay.
6378380	6378780	Come on.
6379660	6387220	I, I, I go in and I use, uh, I cast, uh, torch fingers and, uh, I light a fire.
6387620	6388100	All right.
6390660	6395180	Those potatoes got me feeling like, uh, I think I'm going to turn into a potato.
6397100	6398100	It's a lot of starch.
6398300	6402300	It's, you know, for a guy who's named diarrhea, it's really, excuse you.
6402300	6403700	I'm so constipated.
6404020	6405500	Oh no, really?
6405660	6408260	Yeah, potatoes all the time.
6409020	6409980	We need roughage.
6409980	6414880	We got to get some, uh, so we should probably talk about in light of our
6414880	6418180	conversation with Tom, we got to figure out how to monetize.
6418180	6420740	I mean, we're only growing enough potatoes to eat right now.
6421340	6424260	We're living on property that he claims is not ours.
6424900	6427060	And then we feel like we're just kind of squatting because
6427060	6428060	we killed a ghost here.
6428540	6432540	It's, I mean, do you think if we join their cult, they won't charge us?
6432740	6436900	Well, it seems like he might be more sympathetic, but then again,
6436900	6440580	there's always the danger that, you know, we get sucked back into a world.
6440580	6445580	We don't want to be a part of or even, you know, you say back like a world
6445580	6448540	of adventure, but what if we just end up being shitty potato farmers
6448540	6449820	that are in a pyramid scheme?
6451780	6453220	Well, didn't that happen last time?
6453340	6457540	Well, I mean, in a manner of speaking, yeah, I'm, I'm fucking miserable.
6457540	6459820	You guys, I hate, I hate this life.
6460060	6464140	I want to, like, I'll do anything other than just fucking grow a potato.
6465380	6466940	You ever fucking see a potato?
6466940	6469500	Yeah, what are you talking about?
6469500	6470900	They're the worst.
6470900	6473100	They're just. Well, how do you feel about olives?
6473100	6474460	Huh? Olives.
6474460	6476580	I give olives four potatoes.
6476780	6477780	Damn.
6481140	6483220	What are we doing?
6483220	6484780	You're right. Let's fucking split up.
6484780	6486940	Let's fucking like, like I.
6486940	6489260	I mean, it doesn't have to be so dramatic.
6489260	6490940	Like, like, oh, we hate each other.
6490940	6491620	We love each other.
6491620	6493380	But like, we were a band of adventurers.
6493380	6495420	And then I was like, we're doing this badly.
6495620	6497220	What if we were potato farmers?
6497220	6501140	You guys came with me, but like, you know, and now you're like, I'm miserable.
6501140	6502180	I'm miserable.
6502180	6505460	And I'm like, you know, I'm not happy, but you're not happy.
6505500	6507740	I'm committed to giving this a chance.
6507740	6508620	You were our leader.
6508620	6511380	You were you were the guy that was the most driven among us.
6511380	6513460	Yeah. And now look at you.
6513460	6515420	Yeah. Fucking potato man.
6517940	6518860	Take that back.
6518860	6519380	Huh?
6520700	6521460	Take it back.
6521460	6522620	I won't take it back.
6522620	6524020	You're a potato man.
6524020	6526220	You're nothing but a fucking potato man.
6526620	6526980	Damn.
6526980	6529860	I'm looking at you right now and all I see is a potato.
6529860	6530820	That's savage.
6533660	6536340	You you are you are a mean.
6536380	6537500	What?
6537500	6540260	Oh, that hurts that that doesn't feel good.
6543340	6545220	Oh, I don't like the way you say it.
6545220	6546220	What say what?
6546220	6547620	I'm not a potato man.
6547620	6548540	You're a human being.
6548540	6551780	Tell me, tell me, tell me why you're not like prove to me
6551780	6557660	why you're not a potato man because I'm I don't see any evidence to the contrary.
6557660	6558740	I'm a farmer.
6558740	6559740	There's a difference.
6559740	6561820	I live off of the earth.
6561820	6564980	When you call me a potato man, you make me sound like I'm not a human.
6565500	6569620	Like I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm doing my best.
6569820	6571780	I'm accountable to society.
6572180	6574780	I'm not a potato man.
6574780	6577540	You're a big baby.
6577540	6580300	You're a big pyromaniac baby.
6580780	6582460	Whoa.
6582460	6584420	You're ungrateful, too.
6584420	6586860	You know, like I do most of the hoeing.
6589980	6592220	I peel all the potatoes.
6592220	6593740	You want to peel a potato?
6593740	6595740	No, I mean, I would if I had to.
6595740	6597340	I could do all of this by myself.
6597340	6601020	OK. And so if you're not happy, you know, it hurts.
6601020	6601780	None of us are happy.
6601780	6603020	We're all we're all right.
6603020	6607580	But it makes it worse for you to be like, I'm not happy while we're already not happy.
6607580	6611860	Like it's like it's like if we're in a rowboat and you're like, this isn't a ship
6612420	6615740	and then like jumping up and down on the rowboat, like trying to make it a ship.
6615740	6617340	It's like, OK, let's not fight.
6617340	6619380	I'm sorry. I'm being I'm being aggressive.
6619380	6622260	But like I just I feel incomplete right now.
6624900	6627900	Who?
6627900	6630980	Man, kingdom.
6631620	6635180	Going down the valley.
6635540	6639180	Treasure for a blood throne.
6639660	6642780	Blood throne for a clan.
6644580	6652620	Dragons reach and I'm the horses on the sleigh.
6653580	6664820	Caves and tombs and ale come your way.
6665300	6670420	It's that maybe sing a little old adventuring song from when we used to be on the road.
6670620	6672460	Can I sing the next verse?
6672460	6673300	I'll sing it with you.
6673300	6675060	Yeah, I'll sing it with you.
6675060	6676340	Yeah, go ahead.
6676340	6678060	Wait, you want.
6678060	6679060	What do you want for me?
6679060	6682460	I'll sing along with you. Oh, OK.
6682460	6686900	Oh, Amy.
6688460	6692020	Shoomers.
6698540	6703500	I don't know. All this thing is really making me really hopeful for the future.
6703620	6707780	Yeah, I was like, I haven't heard you sing like that in a long time.
6708500	6711300	I forgot how much that song meant to me.
6711380	6713780	Yeah, you see this. You see the tear.
6713780	6714620	I'm a little embarrassed.
6714620	6717980	I didn't want to wipe it away because I thought it was true today.
6718100	6721380	We why did why do we become farmers?
6721380	6724260	We should have become musicians.
6724780	6727740	Could have been a rambling band.
6727740	6729180	I'm not going to be a negative guy.
6729180	6732140	I mean, that might be the way maybe we feed ourselves from the land
6732140	6734340	and then we go do music during the day.
6734500	6737260	Yeah, I'm willing to give that a try.
6737300	6738180	Sounds like a.
6738180	6739900	Do you guys really think I'm a good singer?
6739900	6741140	Yeah.
6741140	6743220	I that really touched me.
6743220	6744100	I'll say I'll say this.
6744100	6745940	You're a better singer than you are a potato farmer.
6745940	6749220	And that that means a lot because you're a very good potato farmer.
6749220	6751260	Oh, yeah.
6751260	6752020	Well, all right.
6752020	6756380	Well, first thing in the morning, we'll go down to town and we'll see if there's
6756820	6760380	like, I don't know, music jobs. Yeah.
6761660	6762860	Feeling good about this.
6762860	6765980	I feel fucking I haven't felt this excited.
6765980	6768700	Oh, see, that's great.
6768700	6771540	See, it wasn't about choosing between potato farming and adventuring.
6771540	6774500	It was about finding the adventure in the potato farming life.
6775700	6777540	Yeah. Guy comes over.
6777540	6779220	I need rent. How are we going to make that rent?
6779220	6780540	I don't know. Get frustrated.
6780540	6781980	Had a little fight. Made up.
6781980	6783700	Started singing. There we go.
6783700	6785580	Yeah, that's a story.
6785580	6787140	We're a team again. Yeah.
6787140	6789380	A team. I'm so inspired.
6789660	6796700	Oh, oh, Amy Schumer's.
6797580	6800060	Cliffhanger, we did it.
6802100	6803820	Thank you all.
6805340	6808820	I think we can all agree something important happened tonight.
6810020	6813460	Let's give it up for Steve Levy, everybody.
6813460	6815220	Happy Memorial Day.
6815220	6816220	Happy Memorial Day.
6816220	6818700	Don't forget to remember.
6818700	6821020	Spencer Creighton and Jeff Davis, your comptroller.
6821020	6823540	Your mayor is Dan Harmon.
6823540	6825460	Thank you. I'll drive fast and take chances.
6826700	6830540	I kind of love you when I wear a rug.
6830540	6835860	Because everything has been the same since the beginning.
6835860	6839180	Yeah, we're all players in this game.
6839180	6841100	I'm winning.
6841100	6844660	I keep on losing my mind.
6844660	6846900	I can't find it.
6846900	6849860	But I don't really mind.
6849860	6857540	I'm just a loser, but I, I don't like it.
6857540	6860540	Come and give it up.
6860540	6862740	Try.
6862740	6865180	Did you get any of that?
6865180	6867060	It's a good show.
