0	16320	From the Cherokee Casino, in West Silent Springs, Oklahoma, only a biscuit toss away from Arkansas,
16320	29280	and next to 17 other states, right in the middle of everything, Parment Town is in session.
29280	36280	For your entertainment delectation, let's bring out the Game Master, Spencer Crittenden.
36280	44280	What up, Spencer?
44280	46280	What up?
46280	47280	Yeah.
47280	53280	And the mayor of Harment Town, from Hollywood, California, you know him, you reluctantly
53280	54280	like him.
54280	61280	Hello, thank you.
61280	64280	Hello, America.
64280	65280	Osiyo.
65280	69280	I learned that from Jeff.
69280	71280	It's either Osiyo or Siyo.
71280	72280	There's a controversy.
72280	73280	Siyo, I think.
73280	74280	The Cherokee, hello.
74280	75280	I know you're all Cherokee.
75280	76280	Osiyo.
76280	77280	Now, some people say Siyo.
77280	78280	Some people say Osiyo.
78280	79280	Osiyo.
79280	80280	Is it Osiyo?
80280	81280	Oh, I said Osiyo.
81280	82280	See?
82280	83280	I'm already offending everybody.
83280	84280	No.
84280	85280	Thank you so much.
85280	87280	That was such a warm welcome.
87280	88280	Thank you.
88280	93280	And thank you for showing up, and thank you for paying your $15, and thank you for, uh-oh,
93280	95280	there's a slow feedback building.
95280	100280	You can mic check all you want, but you can't fucking, you can't predict that shit.
100280	101280	You hear that?
101280	102280	You hear that?
102280	103280	There it is.
103280	106280	Oh, that's you.
106280	107280	Everybody.
107280	110280	Well, that's very comforting.
111280	114280	Old Man River.
115280	118280	We are right, yeah, we're right smack in the middle.
118280	121280	I mean, even if we, I mean, this isn't like we're doing a show in Oklahoma City, which
121280	125280	wouldn't be a bad thing to do either, but we are, we're in a part of-
125280	130280	Yeah, Oklahoma City wouldn't be a bad thing to do.
130280	131280	At least neutral.
131280	132280	Woo!
133280	137280	But I'm saying more people there would be from, you know, you'd be like, oh, hey, Oklahomans.
137280	138280	And they'd be like, yay.
138280	140280	And it'd be like, there'd be a couple people from out of state.
140280	143280	But we are, like, really, we're in the Deadwood area.
143280	150280	We're in the, we're an unincorporated, like, treaty turf, like, and it's a beautiful thing,
150280	151280	though.
151280	152280	It's like a crossroads.
152280	153280	It's like a-
154280	155280	Woo!
155280	156280	To Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
156280	157280	It's already 9-11.
157280	158280	What?
158280	160280	We started the show at 9-05 or 9-06.
160280	161280	Oh, it's 9-11.
161280	162280	It's already 9-11.
163280	168280	Again, sometimes you have to travel to the Oklahoma, Arkansas border for a room full
168280	169280	of people to cheer.
169280	170280	It's 9-11!
171280	176280	My mind is going to be thinking all night about the 8 to 12 people that bought tickets
176280	178280	just going, let's see some comedy tonight.
179280	183280	And I promise you people, like, what do you mean, you people?
183280	184280	I mean you.
185280	187280	I'm going to, I will come around to you.
187280	192280	I say, you know, to catch you up, I made a show at, I wrote Monster House.
192280	193280	I don't know what to tell you.
194280	197280	I don't know what to tell you why I'm here, why I deserve to be up here.
197280	199280	It's like, like, how come, just think of it like this.
199280	202280	Like, you had that wedding with your drunk brother-in-law.
202280	204280	He had this many people paying attention to him.
204280	205280	Why not me?
206280	207280	You'll figure it out eventually.
207280	209280	But to everybody else, thank you so much.
209280	211280	And, but I was thinking, like, we're right in the middle.
211280	215280	I looked at a map of America and I'm like, you know, we all know Oklahoma is right above
215280	216280	Texas.
216280	217280	You look at it on a map.
217280	218280	It's shaped like a frying pan.
218280	219280	You think of, like, biscuits and stuff.
219280	220280	It's not right above it.
220280	221280	It's right next to it.
221280	222280	What?
222280	223280	It's both.
223280	225280	What a weird thing to call me out on.
225280	226280	That stuff.
226280	227280	It's fucking above Texas.
227280	228280	Like, come on.
228280	229280	Don't make me nervous.
229280	232280	Like, it's right in the spot.
232280	238280	Like, if you were going to punch America, like, it's right, it's right in the bladder.
238280	243280	It's like, you look at Texas and you're like, yeah, that funnels down to, like, you know,
243280	249280	we piss on Mexico and, like, it's like Oklahoma is right where the processing happens.
249280	255280	Like, we funnel all of the intoxicants and things to hear.
255280	259280	And it's like, my dad was born in Oakey and he was telling me about the Trail of Tears
259280	265280	and about all these things and, like, it was occurring to me that that unfortunate legacy,
265280	271280	that there was, like, an actual relocation of people and to here because this is the
271280	272280	place without reservations.
272280	273280	This is the place of treaties.
273280	274280	And there's, like, it's just a spot.
274280	280280	If you Wikipedia Oklahoma and look at Oklahoma just colored in red, like, right where America
280280	282280	is, it's not directly in the center.
282280	287280	It's, like, right above where you pee.
287280	291280	And I don't know what that means, but I think it's important to you.
291280	292280	And it's important to me while I'm here.
292280	297280	And then I'm going to get on a plane and complain about first class and go back to L.A.
297280	302280	I didn't even, like, pay attention to where we were going on this trip while we were connecting
302280	303280	in Dallas.
303280	304280	It's like you were being peed.
304280	305280	Yes, Dan, yes.
305280	309280	My metaphor is apt.
309280	315280	It's watertight.
315280	316280	I didn't know where we were going.
316280	320280	I thought we were going to Oklahoma City until I found out, no, we're going to Tulsa.
320280	327280	And then, but then we're not going to, they were driving all the way to Arkansas.
327280	330280	Basically in Arkansas.
330280	334280	I got up this morning, left the Cherokee Casino and walked to Arkansas.
334280	335280	That's fucking amazing.
335280	336280	Yeah.
336280	337280	No, you literally did.
337280	339280	Like, I woke up to a bunch of texts.
339280	343280	Because there was a time zone difference in my watch and reset, so I played Minecraft
343280	344280	all 4 a.m.
344280	347280	And I thought it was, I thought I was playing Minecraft all 2 a.m.
347280	349280	And so I slept in.
349280	352280	And I woke up to 20 texts from Jeff just going, I walked to Arkansas.
352280	353280	It's amazing.
353280	355280	And I thought you were kidding.
355280	357280	I thought you were trying to make a point.
357280	358280	I don't know.
358280	359280	Like, you were mad.
359280	360280	No, I made friends.
360280	363280	Jesse, Austin, and Hannah from Into the Springs.
363280	364280	Over there.
364280	365280	Hell yeah.
365280	367280	It's a great bar.
367280	368280	They had Fernet Bronco.
368280	370280	It was a fucking paradise.
370280	371280	Yeah.
371280	372280	And everyone here has been very nice.
372280	376280	If it seems random that we're here, I mean, that's credit that goes to, because it's not
376280	377280	random.
377280	379280	Somebody has to put effort into it.
379280	380280	This casino booked us.
380280	381280	They were adamant about it.
381280	383280	The head of marketing here, Lacey.
383280	389280	Lacey, are you here?
389280	395280	We were all a bit excitedly confused about why are we going to this casino.
395280	399280	Because the head of marketing at this casino is a Harmon Town fan.
399280	402280	And she made sure.
402280	411280	She's such a big Harmon Town fan that it would have made sense if this room was empty.
411280	414280	She's hardcore, but still professional.
414280	416280	It wasn't like she booked us to hang out with us.
416280	418280	She has shit to do and has been doing it.
418280	424280	She's a taskmaster and a multitasker and also a lover of the show and booked us, and she
424280	426280	was right and sold out the room.
426280	430280	Okay, so those 12 people that I was talking about before, they're like, when is he going
430280	431280	to start?
431280	432280	Okay.
432280	433280	All right.
433280	438280	So a guy walks into a bar and he says, I want to be with a hooker.
438280	442280	And the madam is like, the hookers cost $8 on Sunday.
442280	447280	And then the guy says, I'll take two, because my brother's Irish.
447280	450280	And he says, what does that mean?
450280	451280	He says, well, I quit drinking.
451280	453280	And my brother's Irish.
453280	458280	So I have a hooker for him every Sunday.
458280	461280	And so he takes the hooker up and he goes and sleeps with her.
461280	462280	And he has a good time.
462280	463280	And he comes down and he goes, thank you.
463280	464280	I did that for my brother.
464280	465280	And he leaves.
465280	466280	I did half for my brother.
466280	467280	And he leaves.
467280	468280	And he comes back and he says, can I have another hooker?
468280	471280	And he does it twice, because you have to do it twice, and then he does the third thing.
471280	473280	And he comes back the third time.
473280	475280	And he says, can I have the hooker again?
475280	480280	And the hooker lady says, not the hooker lady, that's a hooker, the hooker that runs the
480280	481280	hookers.
482280	485280	She says, OK, well, why do you just want one this time?
485280	486280	Why not two?
486280	494280	And he said, because I quit having hooker sex.
494280	497280	And I still have it for my brother.
502280	507280	And that joke was for the people that don't know why the fuck they're here.
507280	508280	I think you sorted that out.
508280	510280	I think now they know that they're in good comedic hands.
510280	517280	You came to a comedy show and you heard a joke told very well by me.
517280	518280	All right.
518280	520280	So that's about all I had to talk about.
520280	525280	I mean, I tried as hard as I could, because I was like, it wasn't because I made any assumptions
525280	529280	about you folks based on where you live, because we have too much of that happening right now.
529280	530280	And I've done it too much.
530280	534280	Like, it's the people that we can't see and touch that we're afraid of, that we judge.
534280	539280	And we go like, oh, well, all those people over there, they think this way, or, you know,
539280	540280	all this stuff.
540280	545280	But for all that reason, I was like, well, probably the polite thing to do is to like,
545280	547280	not, don't make your show boring.
547280	548280	Don't talk about politics.
548280	549280	It's like, everyone's fucking weary.
549280	550280	We're exhausted.
550280	554280	Like, go out and do what you naturally do, which is be so charming and just talk.
554280	558280	So I tried to like, I was like, yeah, I'm just going to use the excuse to stay off of
558280	560280	Twitter for two days and like, not look at the news.
560280	563280	But then I looked last night and played Minecraft in total.
563280	564280	What the fuck is happening?
564280	567280	It's like a fucking sci-fi novel.
568280	570280	But I was like, are we going on stage with the president?
570280	573280	We're going to come off stage and the president's on the lam?
573280	574280	Like, it's crazy.
574280	577280	Like, it doesn't matter where you lean politically.
577280	579280	These are like crazy historical times.
579280	583280	The president himself is erroneously comparing it to Watergate.
583280	586280	I'm like, no, it's different.
586280	589280	Like, I wasn't around back then either.
589280	591280	But like, it's different, sir.
591280	593280	You're off the mark.
593280	594280	This is weirder.
594280	597280	You are under investigation for espionage.
597280	598280	You are.
598280	599280	This is huge.
599280	601280	Anyways, back here.
601280	603280	You're in a red state.
603280	606280	A red state.
606280	607280	Super duper red.
607280	609280	Look, if you voted for him, you still think it's amazing.
609280	611280	He's the first president.
611280	615280	He would become my hero if, like, he went on the lam.
615280	622280	Like, what if the president was in South America tweeting and going like, fuck you haters.
623280	625280	Now I know why you voted for him.
625280	627280	Like, it's this moxie that I get.
627280	629280	I just didn't want it in a president.
629280	630280	But I get it.
630280	631280	I get it.
631280	636280	He's got chutzpah, as the Cherokees say.
636280	639280	You've really assimilated to the culture here.
639280	640280	Yes, I have.
640280	643280	I've asylum-alated.
643280	646280	Seal.
646280	647280	All right.
647280	648280	All right.
648280	650280	I'll take that groan because I don't know what I'm doing.
650280	651280	I'll accept it.
651280	652280	I'll tell you guys for groaning.
652280	654280	I'll call that a good groan.
654280	655280	That was a good groan.
655280	656280	Okay.
656280	657280	So, Spencer, how are you?
657280	658280	Hey, guys.
658280	659280	I'm good.
659280	660280	Thank you.
660280	661280	Thank you.
661280	669280	We got off the plane in Tulsa at the airport, and I lost Spencer for a moment.
669280	671280	People were just taking pictures with him.
671280	672280	He's like a celebrity.
672280	673280	There's one person.
673280	674280	There's one person.
674280	676280	Look, I don't want to keep harping on it, but again, he got more applause than me, I
676280	677280	think.
677280	678280	Yeah, it's weird.
678280	679280	I mean, I don't get it.
679280	680280	I'm fine with it.
680280	681280	Well, fine.
681280	682280	It makes sense to me.
682280	683280	I'm okay with it.
683280	684280	I don't get it.
684280	686280	But I said, hey, Spencer, how are you doing?
686280	687280	You were like, hey, guys.
687280	689280	You're playing to them, not me.
689280	690280	No, that's just a bit.
690280	691280	That's what I do.
691280	696280	But also, no, I say, hey, guys, to you guys.
696280	697280	Dan's being insecure right now.
697280	698280	Yeah.
698280	700280	Let's complain about first class.
700280	702280	You have more Midwest appeal than he does.
702280	703280	I don't get it.
703280	704280	Sometimes the applause is weird.
704280	707280	I tried to wear my Spencer-ist shirt.
708280	711280	I was like, where's my buffet shirt?
711280	715280	Like, where's my lumberjacking shirt?
715280	721280	I want these folks to know I'm on their side when I go out drunk and talk about the president.
721280	722280	All right.
722280	729280	But no, Spencer, on your floor of this very wonderful, very five-star, very worth-your-money
729280	735280	hotel and casino, there was a guy walking around with a shirt and no pants.
735280	736280	I was wearing pants.
736280	737280	And no underpants.
737280	739280	No, I was wearing underpants.
739280	744280	You encountered a guy that was nude from the waist down.
744280	745280	No.
745280	746280	No.
746280	747280	It was on your floor.
747280	750280	I might have heard a naked man.
750280	751280	Okay.
751280	753280	They sound pretty similar, though.
753280	754280	I thought you were part of that encounter.
754280	756280	Lacey said there was a guy.
756280	757280	I shouldn't divulge this.
757280	759280	Yeah, I'm not sure.
759280	762280	There was a guy walking around with no pants and no underwear and cookies.
762280	765280	He had a box of cookies.
765280	767280	That was the apology.
767280	769280	I'm sorry I'm naked.
769280	771280	You take the good with the bad.
771280	773280	Oh, I saw your dick.
773280	774280	I didn't want to.
774280	775280	Oh, cookies.
775280	778280	But he was removed is the moral of the story.
778280	779280	You shouldn't do that here.
779280	782280	And that guy won't be here when you come.
782280	786280	Also, the looser slots in Oklahoma.
786280	790280	I love that idea that there's looser slots.
790280	792280	I like that.
792280	796280	We had a friend that worked in Vegas, your friend, and she had explained.
796280	799280	She was the manager at the Lux for a while.
799280	805280	She was explaining that there's a whole mentality to where they put which slots and stuff.
805280	810280	The most interesting thing of all was that she was talking about how people think that
810280	813280	we're hoping that a gambling addict would walk in the door.
813280	820280	No, they try to spot those people that are having trouble because it's bad marketing.
821280	824280	You don't want somebody walking around outside the casino going,
824280	827280	I lost my house.
827280	831280	You want a sign that says Blue Man Group.
831280	834280	You lose your house while you're watching them.
834280	837280	I'm not trying to be a company man here about the Cherokee Casino,
837280	839280	which is putting us up and treating us very nicely.
839280	841280	But somebody won a house last night.
841280	842280	I think I know.
842280	843280	That's the Big Bang Theory slot machine.
843280	846280	It'll give you a house if you get three bazingas.
846280	847280	Are you mad?
847280	849280	Yes, because it's bigger than my house.
849280	850280	It's not even their house.
850280	851280	It's bigger than mine.
851280	853280	You win it if you like their show.
853280	858280	How many seasons more of community would there have to be to get a community slot machine, do you think?
858280	864280	We would have had to do 8,000 seasons and then submit a form to Sony.
864280	869280	They would be like, explain to us again why we should tell the casino to put a community slot machine in there.
869280	871280	There should be a Rick and Morty slot machine.
871280	873280	That would be a good one.
873280	876280	There should be a Rick and Morty pinball machine.
876280	878280	That would be badass.
878280	882280	Or a slot machine.
882280	883280	So there's tables.
883280	884280	Those of them are just listening.
884280	885280	There's tables here.
885280	888280	We're in this like splendid ballroom.
888280	889280	We've never done this kind of show.
889280	894280	It has an old-timey Vegas feel because all the audience, they get their own tables.
894280	896280	And the tables have numbers.
896280	897280	We've got Dean Martin here.
897280	899280	Lena Horan's over there at table five.
899280	901280	So I don't know how many tables there are.
901280	903280	What do they go up to?
903280	905280	Who thinks they have the highest table number?
905280	907280	It's probably in the back.
907280	908280	What's that one?
908280	909280	Huh?
909280	910280	Six.
910280	911280	Okay.
911280	912280	Six.
912280	913280	Can we beat six?
913280	914280	I'm pretty...
914280	915280	Sixty-six.
915280	916280	Oh, sixty-six.
916280	917280	You're sixty-six.
917280	918280	Oh, so it curls around.
918280	919280	Who can beat sixty-six?
919280	920280	Nobody?
920280	921280	Fifty-five.
921280	922280	It's close.
922280	928280	I think it snakes around and I think you guys are like, oh, it's kind of the worst seat.
928280	931280	Because I'm like...
931280	935280	What are the numbers over here, high or really low?
935280	937280	That's one and that's fifteen.
937280	941280	Maybe it coils around like a cobra ready to strike.
941280	942280	Twenty-five?
942280	945280	That doesn't beat sixty-six, sir.
945280	946280	Sixty-six.
946280	948280	Now we're just talking.
948280	950280	How did you guys get sixty-six?
950280	951280	That's amazing.
951280	952280	They must have added one.
952280	953280	Look where the table is.
953280	956280	They're like, come on, you can get us in.
956280	957280	They're VIPs.
957280	958280	What do they call them?
958280	960280	Whales, VIPs, big, big, big, big gamblers.
960280	961280	What do you call them?
961280	962280	Whales.
962280	963280	Whales.
963280	964280	All right.
964280	969280	High rollers, just walked in here with your own table.
969280	974280	Dan is in a bad mood because he feels guilty that his friend and assistant, Steve Levy,
974280	979280	it was his birthday last night and Dan chose to not know that and spend the night playing
979280	980280	Minecraft in his room.
980280	984280	He chose to not know that.
984280	986280	He woke up one morning and said, fuck that shit.
986280	992280	We're talking about the birthday of a man whose job is to remind me of birthdays.
993280	999280	It's very obvious to me that this is a story about his failing.
999280	1003280	This is how Dan's pissy mood manifests.
1003280	1005280	It's just me explaining the facts.
1005280	1009280	I remember everyone's birthday, but here, guess why?
1009280	1012280	He fucked up.
1012280	1013280	It's okay to feel bad, Dan.
1013280	1016280	You dropped the friendship ball on that one.
1016280	1018280	I fucked up three times.
1018280	1023280	Just tell everybody about Dungeons and Dragons for a second.
1023280	1024280	Oh, man.
1024280	1028280	I was watching Teen Titans Go this morning in the hotel.
1028280	1030280	Is Dan going to take a shit?
1030280	1031280	What's he doing?
1031280	1032280	I'm sure we'll find out.
1032280	1036280	He just ran off stage like a panther.
1036280	1038280	There's ice back there.
1038280	1039280	Oh, shit.
1039280	1041280	There's flammable fluids back there.
1041280	1043280	What else?
1043280	1046280	How has your Oklahoma experience been so far?
1046280	1048280	Teen Titans Go in the hotel room.
1048280	1049280	It was great.
1049280	1050280	Oh, man.
1050280	1051280	Oh, yeah.
1051280	1052280	No, I just watch.
1052280	1053280	I don't watch.
1053280	1054280	I don't have TV.
1054280	1056280	So I only watch TV at hotels.
1056280	1058280	And it's amazing.
1058280	1061280	Oh, it's a cake.
1061280	1064280	Happy birthday, Steve Levy.
1064280	1066280	Oh.
1066280	1077280	I brought you a cake from the kitchen where Lacey got it
1077280	1080280	because she saw on Instagram that it was his birthday.
1080280	1083280	Did you grab a slice while you were back there?
1083280	1086280	And it's the slice that had the word Steve on it.
1086280	1089280	Yeah.
1089280	1092280	But it was delicious because I love Steve.
1092280	1093280	Sure.
1093280	1095280	Anyways, I brought out plates and stuff, too.
1095280	1099280	Why don't you cut it up and slice it up for Table 66?
1099280	1100280	All right, Table 66.
1100280	1101280	Let's start with you.
1101280	1103280	We'll give you a Steve Levy cake.
1103280	1108280	It'll be the best comedy show in the world.
1108280	1109280	All right.
1109280	1111280	So sorry you guys voted for Trump.
1111280	1114280	It doesn't work.
1114280	1116280	You know, come on.
1116280	1118280	We all are embarrassed.
1118280	1119280	It's OK.
1119280	1122280	I fuck up, too.
1123280	1128280	You know, I've broken up with girls because I wanted to play Skyrim.
1128280	1132280	And then two hours later, I was like, what am I doing?
1132280	1134280	Will you get back together with me?
1134280	1135280	No.
1135280	1137280	What, you fucker?
1137280	1138280	You know, come on.
1138280	1139280	Admit it.
1139280	1142280	That's what you did, electorally.
1142280	1143280	Wait.
1143280	1144280	You were mad.
1144280	1148280	You just impugned Oklahoma as being the state that played Skyrim
1148280	1149280	over there.
1149280	1151280	Oklahoma is an artificial construct.
1151280	1156280	These people are from Arkansas.
1156280	1161280	It's a state of mind.
1161280	1164280	Do you know that old John Song Oklahoma is a state of mind?
1164280	1166280	Do you know that one?
1166280	1168280	Oklahoma is what unites all of us.
1168280	1171280	We're all Oklahoman tonight.
1171280	1172280	What?
1172280	1173280	I can't see.
1173280	1174280	What's happening right now?
1174280	1175280	I can't see.
1175280	1176280	Dan is pretending to slice cake.
1176280	1179280	He's making them do it.
1179280	1184280	He's turned them into their own assistants.
1184280	1185280	Dan?
1185280	1186280	I've never done this before.
1186280	1189280	You know, you might have done is given Steve the first slice of that cake
1189280	1190280	before you...
1190280	1192280	I don't know where Steve is.
1192280	1195280	He's probably crying because you forgot his birthday.
1195280	1197280	Steve, are you in the house?
1197280	1198280	He's over by Lacey.
1198280	1200280	Lacey, get up here.
1200280	1203280	Steve, Lacey.
1203280	1212280	It's your birthday, and you're the only Jewish guy in Oklahoma.
1212280	1218280	What's up, Levy?
1218280	1219280	Steve Levy.
1219280	1220280	Happy birthday, man.
1220280	1221280	There it is.
1221280	1222280	Thank you.
1222280	1225280	Now, when I left you last night at the card tables, you were 150 up,
1225280	1227280	and then you ended 50 down.
1227280	1229280	Yeah, it's okay.
1229280	1230280	It was a really fun...
1230280	1232280	It was my birthday.
1232280	1234280	We listened to some country music at the bar.
1234280	1235280	We did.
1235280	1236280	We heard some Dwight Yoakum cover soon.
1236280	1237280	It was good.
1237280	1242280	You guys know Travis Tritts here in March?
1242280	1246280	He's in the small room, but, you know...
1246280	1248280	But he tweeted that he'd like us all to get back to work
1248280	1251280	and stop talking about politics.
1251280	1254280	So here I am, Travis.
1254280	1258280	You're in the small room.
1259280	1262280	Dennis is serving your cake, Steve, over at Table 66.
1262280	1263280	That's great.
1263280	1264280	Everyone enjoy that cake.
1264280	1265280	What's your name, sorry?
1265280	1266280	Luana.
1266280	1267280	Luana, I'm sorry.
1267280	1268280	Okay.
1268280	1269280	You just took...
1269280	1270280	What's your name?
1270280	1271280	How?
1271280	1272280	You just took her cake.
1272280	1273280	I know.
1273280	1274280	You gave it to her, because...
1274280	1275280	You guys...
1275280	1276280	Everyone's...
1276280	1282280	Look, I'm not going to say that Oklahoma's passive-aggressive.
1282280	1283280	You're Arkansas.
1283280	1284280	Okay, fine.
1284280	1285280	Jesus Christ.
1285280	1288280	It's, like, most isolated in this place.
1288280	1290280	But all anyone has in common is...
1290280	1295280	You know that Luana has a death sentence in 12 systems.
1295280	1296280	We heard about some people...
1296280	1297280	There's people...
1297280	1300280	He's walking around with a plate...
1300280	1302280	A tray of plates and forks.
1302280	1303280	Oh, yeah.
1303280	1304280	I forgot the cake.
1304280	1307280	Did you hear that cake, Luana?
1307280	1312280	It's like Randy Quaid is serving cake over here, over in the corner.
1312280	1314280	Jesus Christ.
1314280	1315280	All right, let's...
1315280	1316280	Table 23.
1316280	1317280	How are you guys doing?
1317280	1318280	Just give me some cake.
1318280	1319280	Oh, man.
1319280	1320280	Fuck.
1320280	1321280	And there's a seat here.
1321280	1323280	I didn't think about this, but these tables would be great with dice.
1323280	1325280	Somebody go to the bathroom or...
1325280	1326280	Like, roll.
1326280	1328280	This is the most work I've seen him do outside of writing.
1328280	1329280	Yes, yeah.
1329280	1332280	This is the most exercise he's ever had in his life.
1332280	1334280	Well, I mean, that's not true.
1334280	1336280	They've been watching him on the elliptical.
1336280	1340280	No, he takes a shot of him doing the elliptical, and then he doesn't.
1340280	1341280	It's just a vine.
1341280	1342280	It's not a...
1343280	1345280	He spends the next 10 minutes posting that photo.
1345280	1349280	Well, that's why he plays the music, so they know that it's not just a loop.
1349280	1350280	All right.
1350280	1353280	I'm trying to do a podcast over here at Table 23.
1353280	1356280	Dan, why don't you introduce us to the good folks over at Table 23?
1356280	1357280	Yeah.
1357280	1358280	How are you guys?
1358280	1364280	Do you have a table name, like a team, like the panhandlers, the...
1364280	1365280	Table Voltron?
1365280	1366280	Okay, that's...
1366280	1367280	All right, good.
1367280	1368280	Table Voltron?
1368280	1371280	Yeah, they have nerds in Oklahoma.
1371280	1372280	They land...
1372280	1374280	Lion Voltron or vehicle Voltron?
1374280	1376280	Not shitty car Voltron, right?
1376280	1377280	Like Lion Voltron.
1377280	1379280	And aren't you guys like 23?
1379280	1381280	Why do you know about Voltron?
1381280	1386280	Don't tell me Bruckheimer's making some shitty movie about it.
1386280	1387280	All right.
1387280	1388280	Where'd you...
1388280	1390280	Where are you guys from?
1390280	1391280	St. Louis.
1391280	1392280	St. Louis?
1393280	1394280	They're from St. Louis.
1394280	1395280	Where are you from?
1395280	1396280	Arkansas.
1396280	1397280	Arkansas?
1397280	1398280	Okay.
1398280	1399280	You're from Tulsa?
1399280	1400280	Okay.
1401280	1402280	You don't just...
1402280	1403280	Nobody whooped for St. Louis.
1403280	1404280	That was weird.
1404280	1407280	It's the only time no one's whooped for a city.
1407280	1410280	Well, they don't believe you're from there until you prove it.
1410280	1412280	It's a little Missouri joke.
1412280	1414280	It's called the Prove Me state.
1414280	1415280	Yeah.
1415280	1418280	Show Me documentation state.
1418280	1419280	Show Me.
1419280	1420280	Show Me that you're...
1420280	1422280	Are you eating cake or serving cake?
1422280	1423280	Serving it.
1423280	1424280	I'm preoccupied.
1424280	1425280	He's never done it before.
1425280	1426280	I'm multitasker.
1426280	1427280	This is...
1427280	1428280	Don't worry about him.
1428280	1429280	This is Kevin Day.
1429280	1430280	All right.
1430280	1432280	Well, what do you guys...
1432280	1433280	You guys...
1433280	1438280	What would you like to hear me perform my patented musical act about?
1438280	1440280	Like, what's most in your mind right now?
1440280	1445280	You're sort of a cross-section of white America.
1448280	1451280	If all of America has penises and...
1453280	1454280	Yeah.
1454280	1458280	You're the heart of the loaf of a nice fluffy white bread.
1460280	1467280	What is that part of America most think about right now?
1468280	1469280	Mama-fucking?
1469280	1470280	Really?
1470280	1471280	I think I can...
1471280	1472280	All right.
1472280	1474280	Well, you heard him.
1474280	1475280	Wait.
1475280	1476280	Did he say that or did you...
1476280	1477280	No.
1477280	1478280	Here.
1478280	1479280	Repeat it.
1479280	1481280	I said mama-fucking because it's going to happen, right?
1481280	1482280	Right.
1482280	1485280	According to the ancient Greeks, it always does.
1485280	1486280	Yeah.
1486280	1487280	Yeah.
1488280	1489280	Yo.
1489280	1490280	Yo.
1490280	1491280	Yo.
1491280	1492280	Yo.
1492280	1494280	But can you give cake while you rap?
1494280	1495280	Yeah.
1495280	1497280	I fucked your mama so hard, I did it in Oklahoma.
1497280	1500280	I fucked her until she got lymphoma.
1500280	1502280	Oh, no.
1502280	1503280	All right.
1503280	1504280	Sorry about that.
1504280	1505280	Yo.
1505280	1506280	Oh, okay.
1506280	1507280	Yeah, good.
1507280	1509280	That was probably a good song.
1509280	1510280	That was a mercy call.
1510280	1511280	Okay.
1511280	1512280	That was good.
1512280	1513280	All right.
1513280	1514280	Thank you, Table 23.
1514280	1515280	Thank you, Table 23.
1515280	1516280	That was a good request.
1516280	1523280	You're serving out cake and giving people's mama's cancer.
1523280	1525280	I fucked her until she got it.
1525280	1528280	That means I gave her a long life.
1528280	1529280	She got it actuarially.
1529280	1531280	She got it statistically.
1531280	1535280	She succumbed to it after a lifetime of being cherished as a partner.
1535280	1540280	And she died holding my hand.
1540280	1543280	But she didn't have lymphoma until you fucked her.
1543280	1545280	She might have lived longer.
1545280	1549280	That's a really cynical way of looking at it.
1549280	1550280	Table 11.
1550280	1551280	How are you?
1551280	1552280	What's your name?
1552280	1553280	I'm Chandra.
1553280	1554280	Chandra?
1554280	1555280	You did it with a hard chug.
1555280	1556280	Like, it's not Chandra.
1556280	1557280	It's Chandra.
1557280	1558280	Everyone fucks it up, though.
1558280	1559280	I just wanted to make sure.
1559280	1560280	Everyone?
1560280	1562280	Well, because you're – is that your given name?
1562280	1564280	Your mom was like, your name's Chandra.
1564280	1566280	And she said, people are going to try to say Chandra.
1566280	1567280	Fuck them.
1567280	1570280	I've just been through it so many times.
1570280	1572280	I've just been through it so many times.
1572280	1573280	Fuck that.
1573280	1574280	Sorry.
1574280	1575280	I got it.
1575280	1576280	Yeah.
1576280	1577280	Yeah.
1577280	1578280	Yeah.
1578280	1579280	Yeah.
1579280	1581280	You said, mama, and fuck them.
1581280	1582280	Yeah.
1582280	1583280	C-H-A-N-D-R-A.
1583280	1585280	How do you read that?
1585280	1586280	Here's what I say.
1586280	1587280	It's Chandra.
1587280	1588280	Not Chandra.
1588280	1589280	It's Chandra.
1589280	1590280	Not Chandra.
1590280	1594280	You're going to pronounce it the way that my mama told me.
1594280	1599280	I fucked your mama so hard she got emboldened.
1599280	1601280	Stop giving people some other diseases.
1601280	1606280	I don't think emboldening women is a disease.
1606280	1611280	I don't care how far south we go.
1611280	1615280	I thought you said mold.
1615280	1618280	He said that, and then he just served that cake like it was a mic drop.
1618280	1619280	It was amazing.
1619280	1620280	None of it.
1620280	1627280	Well, you know, yeah, you get – look, but look, everybody at the surrounding tables might
1627280	1628280	have.
1628280	1630280	You don't have to apologize.
1630280	1633280	Look, I'm giving amnesty to everybody that voted for Trump.
1633280	1636280	I don't care if everyone in the room did or everyone didn't.
1636280	1638280	Like, amnesty.
1638280	1643280	Let them slowly come around to the – like, that's our only chance right now.
1643280	1648280	Let them give them the space that they need to be like, oops.
1648280	1649280	Right.
1649280	1651280	We live in a world where no one wants to be wrong.
1651280	1653280	Have you ever tried to take keys from a drunk person?
1653280	1658280	It's like the part of their brain that gives you keys isn't in control.
1658280	1660280	Just let them, like, I'm as guilty as you are.
1660280	1661280	I get mad.
1661280	1663280	And then I'm like – but it's like, what's the solution here?
1663280	1664280	It's understanding.
1664280	1665280	We've got to prove.
1665280	1667280	And what are we – what are we at war for?
1667280	1668280	We want understanding.
1668280	1670280	I didn't clear the room, did I?
1670280	1672280	Did people leave?
1672280	1675280	It's about love, my mothers.
1675280	1676280	All right, whatever.
1676280	1678280	I don't know what I'm lecturing you about.
1678280	1681280	Thank you, table 11.
1682280	1687280	Each table I walk away from, there's a six-person applause.
1687280	1689280	Like, thank you.
1689280	1691280	It's called thank you for leaving our table.
1691280	1692280	Yes.
1692280	1696280	It's exactly – I've become a mariachi band.
1696280	1698280	It's like, okay, that's wonderful.
1698280	1700280	I'm sure it's very valuable.
1700280	1702280	Wherever you're from, please let us eat.
1702280	1704280	All right, here we go.
1704280	1706280	Table 31.
1706280	1707280	All right.
1707280	1709280	Famous for its seats where I can sit.
1709280	1711280	All right, where are you guys from?
1711280	1712280	You're Siloam.
1712280	1713280	You're from Siloam?
1713280	1714280	Whoa.
1714280	1717280	So you didn't just wander in and go, let's see a show, did you?
1717280	1718280	Are you the podcast guys?
1718280	1719280	Wait, what?
1719280	1720280	Sorry?
1720280	1721280	Are you guys the podcast guys?
1721280	1722280	No, they're over there.
1722280	1723280	Sorry, sorry podcast guys.
1723280	1724280	We'll get to you later.
1724280	1725280	Continue.
1725280	1727280	Be sorry to this podcast guy.
1727280	1729280	I'm trying to –
1729280	1730280	You'll be fine.
1730280	1731280	I'm doing experimental conversations.
1731280	1734280	You're doing great and everyone loves it.
1735280	1740280	Although, I just noticed, the only table not clapping was table 11.
1740280	1742280	They didn't clap for that one.
1742280	1743280	They're jealous.
1743280	1744280	Too late now.
1744280	1745280	Too late.
1745280	1747280	It's like if you have a two-year-old and then you have another kid, he's like, oh, Mommy,
1747280	1748280	how come I don't trust you?
1748280	1751280	Also, the thing is, when people realize this cake is laced with hash, it's going to be
1751280	1754280	a fucking awesome, awesome show.
1754280	1762280	It's laced with a standard lowering chemical called Bud Light.
1762280	1763280	It's only 3.2.
1763280	1764280	All right.
1764280	1767280	You guys can't even get real beer in Oklahoma?
1767280	1768280	What the fuck?
1768280	1770280	You can get some, right?
1770280	1771280	What's the population?
1771280	1772280	It's not West Siloam.
1772280	1773280	West Siloam is Arkansas.
1773280	1774280	You're from this.
1774280	1775280	West Siloam?
1775280	1776280	West Siloam.
1776280	1777280	West Siloam.
1777280	1778280	Wait.
1778280	1779280	Sorry, I didn't get that.
1779280	1781280	West Siloam is Oklahoma.
1781280	1782280	Okay.
1782280	1783280	We're in West Siloam.
1783280	1784280	That's the Siloam that you're from.
1784280	1785280	The West one.
1785280	1786280	You're from Siloam.
1786280	1787280	You're from Arkansas.
1787280	1788280	God, fucking Arkansas people.
1788280	1789280	They're everywhere.
1789280	1791280	All right.
1792280	1795280	So how far was the drive?
1795280	1796280	Five minutes.
1796280	1797280	Five minutes?
1797280	1798280	Yeah.
1798280	1799280	We went, we walked there.
1799280	1800280	I walked there today.
1800280	1801280	We walked.
1801280	1802280	You even said we walked.
1802280	1804280	Also, I was told by the people at Inn of the Springs.
1804280	1805280	Yeah, you said on stage.
1805280	1810280	That Siloam Springs, Arkansas is the third nicest place to visit in Arkansas.
1812280	1813280	All right.
1813280	1815280	I mean, I've only ever been there.
1815280	1817280	So for me, it's the number one place to visit.
1817280	1818280	All right.
1818280	1820280	Well, which table came the furthest?
1821280	1822280	Five hours over there.
1822280	1824280	Six hours.
1824280	1825280	I heard an eight.
1825280	1826280	Can anyone be eight?
1826280	1828280	Ten, ten hours I got over here.
1828280	1829280	Right.
1829280	1830280	In the back.
1830280	1831280	Ten hours.
1831280	1832280	You got in the back.
1832280	1833280	There's someone back there.
1833280	1834280	In the back.
1834280	1835280	Put your hand up.
1835280	1836280	How long?
1836280	1837280	Whoa.
1839280	1840280	You know what?
1840280	1841280	Hang on.
1841280	1842280	Did you fly?
1842280	1843280	Yeah, you probably did.
1843280	1844280	Huh?
1844280	1845280	Wait.
1845280	1847280	That's like three and a half hours.
1847280	1850280	Who traveled the longest together?
1851280	1852280	He drove from Atlanta.
1852280	1853280	Six hours.
1853280	1854280	All right.
1854280	1855280	Well, look.
1855280	1856280	Nine?
1856280	1857280	There's ten.
1857280	1858280	Ten hours.
1858280	1859280	Where'd you guys come from?
1859280	1860280	Minneapolis.
1860280	1861280	You drove from Minneapolis?
1861280	1862280	Yeah, I drove from Minneapolis.
1862280	1864280	To see this piece of shit?
1865280	1867280	Dan, get that guy some cake.
1867280	1868280	Ten hours in Minneapolis.
1868280	1870280	I'll be right there.
1870280	1871280	What are these guys?
1871280	1872280	Will we just discount them?
1872280	1873280	Ten hours.
1873280	1875280	We don't know anything about them.
1875280	1876280	They're ten hours, too?
1876280	1877280	Yeah.
1877280	1878280	Oh, shit.
1878280	1879280	What's going on, Table 20?
1879280	1880280	Where are you from?
1880280	1881280	Champaign, Illinois.
1881280	1882280	Wow.
1882280	1883280	Champaign, Illinois.
1883280	1885280	I almost went to college there.
1885280	1886280	All right.
1886280	1890280	Take a very small crumb of cake like this.
1890280	1892280	There were the plates.
1892280	1897280	Now, we were told, because normally when we run out of cake, we start serving booze, but
1897280	1901280	we're legally not allowed to serve you people alcohol, so sorry about that.
1901280	1902280	Perfect.
1902280	1903280	I know.
1903280	1905280	Yeah, we don't like laws.
1905280	1907280	You just got to obey them.
1907280	1908280	All right.
1908280	1909280	Now, I'll go over to the guy.
1909280	1911280	You guys are so fucking hard up.
1911280	1913280	Is there cake left?
1913280	1914280	Yeah.
1914280	1916280	I'm giving it all to him, okay?
1916280	1917280	All right.
1917280	1918280	What's your name, sir?
1918280	1919280	I'm Adam.
1919280	1920280	Adam, okay.
1920280	1921280	Did you ever...
1921280	1922280	Do you love your mother?
1922280	1923280	You know I do.
1923280	1924280	Did you know I fucked her?
1924280	1925280	Hit it.
1930280	1932280	Adam was the first man in Eden.
1933280	1935280	But I fucked your mom until she started bleeding.
1935280	1936280	I'm sorry.
1937280	1940280	It was the only thing that rhymed if you have a certain...
1941280	1943280	There was no way I was going to rhyme anything else.
1943280	1944280	I did not...
1944280	1946280	I don't have the capacity.
1946280	1948280	I'm not on whose line?
1948280	1950280	I'm not an improviser.
1952280	1956280	I don't have nine words that rhyme with Eden, just like up my sleeve.
1956280	1957280	Okay.
1957280	1958280	Eden.
1958280	1959280	Needon.
1959280	1960280	Yeah.
1960280	1961280	Here.
1961280	1962280	Please.
1962280	1964280	I fucked your mom so hard, she moved to Sweden.
1965280	1966280	Yeah.
1966280	1967280	Because the health care is better than...
1967280	1968280	All right.
1969280	1970280	M.C. hindsight, everybody.
1970280	1971280	M.C. hindsight.
1972280	1974280	He's the greatest rapper in the world.
1974280	1976280	He has the power of time travel.
1979280	1982280	He's the NFL's most valuable quarterback every Monday.
1982280	1983280	It's a sports joke.
1983280	1985280	Look it up, Oklahoma.
1985280	1986280	All right.
1986280	1987280	Jesus Christ, look at you guys.
1987280	1990280	Hey, how about those hogs today in the basketball?
1992280	1994280	Yeah, that's a fucking sports reference.
1995280	1996280	This is more the image of the...
1996280	1999280	This is what I expected the audience to be.
1999280	2001280	You guys are not fans of mine, are you?
2001280	2002280	They don't know who you are.
2002280	2003280	Yeah.
2005280	2010280	There's a stack of poker chips on the table, a pile of cash, small bills.
2011280	2013280	The phone is charging with a portable battery.
2013280	2015280	The eyes are very bloodshot.
2015280	2016280	They're handsome men.
2016280	2017280	They're not...
2017280	2020280	There's nothing wrong with them, but they are not here to see you.
2021280	2022280	Dan, introduce them.
2022280	2025280	I said we do some high-stakes gambling right now.
2025280	2026280	What are your names?
2026280	2027280	You don't have to...
2027280	2031280	Look, we're not going to violate anybody that came here that's new.
2032280	2034280	Fred, that's Bill, that's John.
2034280	2035280	You're Fred, that's Bill, that's John.
2035280	2037280	This is your spokesman.
2040280	2045280	The guy that can barely say Fred, Bill, and John is the one that does all the talking.
2050280	2052280	Does anybody here have nerd dice?
2052280	2054280	Anyone holding dice on them right now?
2054280	2055280	Here.
2055280	2057280	I don't know how allowed you are to have dice here.
2058280	2059280	What are you guys...
2059280	2061280	Where are you guys from?
2061280	2062280	Arkansas.
2062280	2063280	Okay.
2064280	2065280	Short drive.
2065280	2067280	Are you up?
2067280	2068280	Are you down?
2069280	2070280	Hold on.
2070280	2071280	Okay.
2071280	2072280	He's checking his...
2073280	2075280	Oh, he's got a big stack of hundreds.
2075280	2076280	I'm 100.
2076280	2078280	Dan, do you have cash in you right now?
2078280	2079280	Yeah, I think so.
2080280	2081280	Hold on.
2081280	2085280	I mean, I have a guy named Mark over here from table...
2085280	2086280	What table?
2086280	2087280	A table 11.
2087280	2088280	Your nemeses.
2089280	2094280	I have a sack of nerd dice over here and I have 2d6 right now.
2094280	2098280	We're going to play some Harmon Town craps with your gambler friends over there.
2098280	2101280	This could be truly against federal law in some way.
2101280	2102280	I don't give a shit.
2102280	2103280	Let them shut us down.
2103280	2109280	This could be the turning point in the story that makes the entire tribe lose everything.
2109280	2113280	There's a SWAT team that's been on the roof for 25 years and they're like,
2113280	2114280	It's go time!
2114280	2115280	All right.
2115280	2117280	We never knew they'd do it, but they did it.
2117280	2119280	It's an illegal game of dying.
2119280	2121280	Is somebody at that table...
2121280	2123280	What table number are we over here?
2124280	2125280	52.
2125280	2126280	Table 52.
2126280	2128280	Are you guys dice players over there?
2128280	2129280	Yeah.
2129280	2130280	All right.
2130280	2131280	Okay.
2131280	2132280	I got 2d6 right now.
2132280	2133280	Spencer, I'm going to give them to you.
2133280	2134280	We trust Spencer.
2134280	2135280	Sure.
2135280	2137280	I think you just want to incriminate me.
2138280	2139280	All right.
2139280	2141280	So we're going to play...
2141280	2142280	Why don't we start low?
2142280	2145280	Let's start like 20 bucks.
2145280	2148280	No one knows what's happening.
2148280	2151280	We're going to play some low level craps right now.
2151280	2152280	I'm gambling against them?
2152280	2153280	Yes.
2153280	2154280	Okay.
2156280	2158280	It's worse than prison.
2158280	2160280	We're Dungeons and Dragons people.
2160280	2164280	Spencer, roll one dice for Dan.
2164280	2166280	One dice for Dan and one die for them.
2166280	2168280	And the higher number is going to go first.
2168280	2170280	They're going to be the come out roll on the craps table.
2170280	2171280	It's so complicated.
2171280	2174280	So roll one die for Dan and one die for the table.
2174280	2175280	This seems illegal.
2175280	2177280	It's going to be fine.
2177280	2178280	It's going to be fine.
2178280	2179280	Dan won.
2179280	2180280	Okay.
2180280	2182280	So Dan, you're going to be the shooter on this one.
2182280	2183280	Okay.
2183280	2185280	So now Spencer's going to roll two dice.
2185280	2187280	Lacey, is this illegal?
2187280	2188280	Okay.
2188280	2191280	We got the Cherokee meh hand.
2191280	2198280	It's derived from the, that's the spirit of the wind saying,
2198280	2200280	I don't know if this clam chowder is so good.
2200280	2204280	The so-so sign is how the eagle flies.
2204280	2205280	So right now.
2205280	2206280	So we know that's racist.
2206280	2207280	Lacey, isn't that racist?
2207280	2208280	Spencer.
2208280	2209280	Okay.
2209280	2210280	So here's the deal.
2210280	2213280	What's going to happen right now is the come out roll is going to be 7-11
2213280	2218280	automatic winner, one, two, three, and 12 craps.
2218280	2220280	Otherwise it's a point.
2220280	2221280	Yeah.
2221280	2222280	Who's our surrogate over here?
2222280	2224280	Who's our player over the table?
2224280	2227280	This guy that looks like Jason Sudeikis.
2227280	2228280	He's a handsome guy.
2228280	2229280	What's his name?
2229280	2230280	What's your name?
2230280	2232280	It's Paul.
2232280	2233280	Paul.
2233280	2234280	All right.
2234280	2235280	Paul, who looks like Jason Sudeikis.
2235280	2236280	That was said.
2236280	2239280	Paul, you know the deal right now, Paul, because Dan's going to be the shooter.
2239280	2244280	If he rolls a seven or 11, he wins $20 off of you.
2245280	2248280	If he rolls craps, two, three, 12, you win.
2248280	2249280	And then otherwise he rolls a point.
2249280	2251280	He has to roll that before he rolls a seven.
2251280	2252280	You know the thing.
2252280	2253280	I give them 20 if I roll.
2253280	2255280	Dan, put your 20 on the table right now.
2255280	2258280	Paul, pony up your 20 for the table right now.
2258280	2261280	Is everyone having a good time?
2261280	2262280	All right.
2262280	2263280	They got cake.
2263280	2264280	We're gambling.
2264280	2265280	We're fucked up.
2265280	2266280	It's amazing.
2266280	2269280	Put your 20 bones down on the fucking tablecloth there.
2269280	2270280	Okay.
2270280	2271280	You got what?
2271280	2272280	Are we doing side bets?
2272280	2274280	If you want to handle side bets.
2274280	2276280	Anybody that wants to handle side bets.
2276280	2277280	What's your name over there?
2277280	2280280	What table are you?
2280280	2283280	No, but you can be the book agent over there.
2283280	2285280	What table are you?
2285280	2286280	Jim.
2286280	2289280	Table number what?
2289280	2292280	Table 41.
2292280	2296280	If you want to lay side bets on this right now, you can go talk to Jim at table 41.
2296280	2298280	Mark almost got up and did it.
2298280	2299280	All right.
2299280	2301280	You know, there's a lawyer at this table.
2301280	2302280	Yeah.
2302280	2304280	He's probably a gambling addict.
2304280	2309280	It's the guy that has lost the ability to pronounce the word Fred, but there's a lawyer at the table.
2309280	2310280	All right.
2310280	2311280	Okay.
2311280	2313280	Spencer, roll the come out dice.
2313280	2314280	Is it Paul?
2314280	2315280	What's his name?
2315280	2316280	Paul.
2316280	2317280	Paul is the roller.
2317280	2318280	Okay.
2318280	2321280	You have 20 bucks out, both of you right now.
2321280	2322280	Spencer, roll the come out dice.
2322280	2323280	Come on out.
2323280	2324280	We got a hot cheater.
2324280	2325280	11.
2325280	2326280	11, a winner.
2326280	2328280	Dan Harmon, you just won $20 off of Paul.
2329280	2330280	Now, Dan.
2330280	2331280	All right.
2331280	2336280	Well, I want to give it to the tribe of Paul foundation.
2336280	2337280	No, no, no.
2337280	2340280	Dan, you pick up that 20 and we keep rolling.
2340280	2343280	Paul, Paul, do you like this action?
2343280	2344280	I know.
2344280	2345280	This is insane.
2345280	2346280	What?
2346280	2348280	Paul, we're going to go double nothing right now.
2348280	2349280	Now it's $40 on the line.
2349280	2351280	$40 on the line right now.
2351280	2353280	Paul has a legitimate loss on his hand.
2353280	2354280	Fuck Paul.
2354280	2355280	This is bigger than Paul.
2356280	2359280	The dice aren't visible.
2359280	2360280	Now, wait.
2360280	2361280	You're George?
2361280	2362280	Which one?
2362280	2363280	I can't remember.
2363280	2365280	You're Paul too.
2365280	2366280	Okay.
2366280	2367280	All right.
2367280	2368280	Okay.
2368280	2369280	Two Pauls.
2369280	2370280	He put more money on the table.
2370280	2371280	Second Paul.
2371280	2373280	Do you want to go $40 on this come out roll?
2373280	2374280	Yeah.
2374280	2375280	We got it down.
2375280	2376280	Okay.
2376280	2377280	Spencer, roll those bones.
2377280	2378280	We got a hot cheater.
2378280	2379280	Come out dice.
2379280	2380280	Jesus.
2380280	2381280	Seven.
2381280	2384280	Seven, a winner.
2384280	2387280	Dan, you're up 60 bones right now.
2387280	2390280	Who at that table, 52, wants to go 60 bucks?
2390280	2391280	Yeah.
2391280	2393280	Who wants to go $60 on the come line?
2393280	2395280	This is not a good idea.
2395280	2396280	No.
2396280	2397280	Come on.
2397280	2399280	Dan is cleaning house right now.
2399280	2400280	Okay.
2400280	2401280	He's kicking ass.
2401280	2403280	These guys didn't even come to see our show.
2403280	2405280	Yeah, but I know Dan so well.
2405280	2406280	He's got to be...
2406280	2407280	He is not enjoying this.
2407280	2408280	All right.
2408280	2409280	Paul.
2409280	2410280	Paul, number one.
2410280	2411280	Who wants to...
2411280	2412280	How about $100 on the fucking line right now?
2412280	2413280	$100?
2413280	2414280	Okay.
2414280	2415280	So if they win or if I...
2415280	2416280	Yeah.
2416280	2417280	Yeah.
2417280	2418280	You'll go down 40.
2418280	2419280	They'll get back 60 other dollars.
2419280	2420280	I know.
2420280	2425280	Well, I've never been more on the side of people that didn't like me.
2425280	2426280	Well, try...
2426280	2429280	Dan, do your best to make Spencer roll you craps right now.
2429280	2430280	Okay.
2430280	2431280	Okay.
2431280	2432280	So we got...
2432280	2433280	Oh, craps.
2433280	2434280	Do we have 100 bones down on the table right now?
2434280	2435280	Yes.
2435280	2436280	They put 100 down.
2436280	2437280	All right.
2437280	2438280	Spencer, don't lie.
2438280	2439280	Give us an honest roll.
2439280	2440280	You ready?
2440280	2441280	Coming out.
2441280	2442280	I don't even know what the results mean.
2442280	2443280	11, a winner.
2443280	2444280	Oh, craps.
2444280	2445280	Dan, you're up...
2445280	2446280	Dan, you're up 160 right now.
2446280	2447280	Oh, craps.
2447280	2448280	Is that for real?
2448280	2449280	No, he's making change.
2449280	2450280	He's really giving me their money.
2450280	2451280	These guys are gentlemen.
2451280	2452280	Come on.
2452280	2453280	They deserve...
2453280	2454280	All right, Dan.
2454280	2455280	Dan, you're up 160 right now.
2455280	2456280	Yes, I am.
2456280	2457280	Put 200 on the table.
2457280	2458280	And also they paid...
2458280	2459280	Don't forget they paid $15 for this.
2459280	2460280	But they're gamblers.
2460280	2461280	They have a problem.
2461280	2462280	No, what?
2462280	2463280	Oh, come on.
2463280	2464280	These people clap.
2464280	2465280	Okay, okay.
2465280	2466280	Look, we got the high side.
2466280	2467280	We got... we're in the illegal zone.
2467280	2468280	Okay.
2468280	2469280	Yeah.
2469280	2470280	No shit.
2470280	2471280	How about this, Dan?
2471280	2473280	At the end of it, you get to give it back to them, if you like.
2473280	2476280	How about if I do a wrap and it's great, they win $160.
2476280	2477280	Well, they're going to lose that fucking...
2477280	2478280	And the rest of the cake.
2478280	2479280	That's a losing pleasure.
2479280	2482280	But it's up to me whether it's great.
2482280	2483280	Okay.
2483280	2490280	Well, I'm going to give it back to Dan.
2491280	2492280	That's a losing pleasure.
2492280	2493280	But it's up to me whether it's great.
2493280	2494280	Okay.
2494280	2496280	Well, that sounds like the fucking house has the vig on it.
2496280	2498280	No, we can't give you booze.
2498280	2499280	You can order it.
2499280	2500280	I'll buy your next drink.
2500280	2502280	You can't give us booze.
2502280	2503280	Right.
2503280	2507280	I can't give you booze, but I can give you money towards buying a drink.
2507280	2509280	You guys remind me of every friend of my dad's.
2509280	2512280	That's why I'm being nice to you.
2512280	2514280	But please buzz from work.
2514280	2517280	Dan, your dice are hot as shit right now.
2517280	2519280	I can't believe you're going to walk away from that table.
2519280	2520280	They're so hot.
2520280	2521280	They're illegal.
2521280	2522280	I'm already rich.
2522280	2523280	I don't need this.
2523280	2524280	I'm sure there's zoning laws that cover this.
2524280	2527280	Every time Monster House comes out of Blu-ray in some country, I get a check.
2527280	2528280	I'm like, what is this?
2528280	2529280	Buy the dog a hat.
2529280	2531280	I don't know.
2531280	2534280	I just want to die.
2534280	2536280	I just hate money.
2536280	2537280	I hate money.
2537280	2540280	Well, they give them the 160 they owe you.
2540280	2541280	I did.
2541280	2543280	I gave them all my money.
2543280	2546280	And now I'm going to give them a wrap about how money's bad.
2546280	2547280	Love it.
2547280	2549280	Dan Harmon, everybody.
2551280	2552280	Yo.
2552280	2553280	Yo.
2553280	2554280	Yo.
2554280	2555280	Yo.
2555280	2556280	Cha-ching.
2556280	2557280	Cha-ching.
2557280	2559280	More like Charon.
2559280	2561280	Cash is a sad, sad song.
2561280	2562280	You make money.
2562280	2563280	You give it to a bank.
2563280	2564280	You go to your grave.
2564280	2567280	You find out the money stank because it kept you from living.
2567280	2569280	It kept you from giving.
2569280	2571280	It kept you from doing everything you should have.
2571280	2572280	Something.
2572280	2574280	I fucked your mama so hard.
2574280	2577280	I would step back if she exploded into shards.
2577280	2578280	She's like a...
2578280	2582280	Again, you keep killing people's mothers.
2582280	2584280	One woman has lymphoma.
2584280	2586280	One is bleeding to death.
2586280	2588280	You guys are up at least 20, right?
2588280	2589280	Like, we're a square.
2589280	2590280	Okay.

2592280	2593280	George, Paul, and Ringo?
2593280	2594280	It was...
2594280	2595280	It was too false.
2595280	2596280	Thank you for coming to the show.
2596280	2597280	You're a good sports.
2597280	2598280	Thank you.
2598280	2599280	All right.
2599280	2603280	You could have fucking taken those guys for every cent they had.
2603280	2604280	Well, yeah, I could have.
2604280	2606280	Those guys were hot as a Mexican lens.
2606280	2607280	His podcast is going to be...
2607280	2610280	It's about ingratiating yourself into the locals, you know?
2610280	2611280	You're supposed to...
2611280	2612280	Hi, guys.

2635280	2636280	I think it's a gym.
2636280	2637280	I think it's a gym.
2637280	2638280	Oh, gym.
2638280	2639280	Okay.
2639280	2640280	All right.

2641280	2642280	Okay.
2642280	2643280	Gym.
2643280	2644280	Gym.
2644280	2645280	Gym.
2645280	2646280	No, it's actually gym.
2646280	2647280	Yeah.
2647280	2648280	Why is everybody pointing to you?
2648280	2649280	Why are you the table's mascot?
2649280	2652280	Because I'm cute, dude.
2652280	2653280	All right.
2653280	2654280	Yeah.
2654280	2655280	Because I like you.
2655280	2656280	Okay.

2668280	2669280	Yeah.
2669280	2670280	Yeah.
2670280	2671280	Take the spoons.
2671280	2672280	Take everything.
2672280	2673280	That bit's dead.
2673280	2674280	Dead bit.
2674280	2675280	Jam, everybody.
2675280	2678280	Work in the crowd.
2678280	2685280	Who said I can't work the crowd?
2685280	2686280	Nobody said that.
2686280	2687280	He can't work the crowd.
2687280	2689280	I dare you to work the crowd.
2689280	2694280	I feel like an emotional speaker, but you're not helping anybody.
2694280	2697280	I'm like a self-hurt guru.
2697280	2698280	Whoa.
2698280	2699280	All right.
2699280	2700280	Get used to it.
2700280	2701280	You're doing a show.
2701280	2702280	Calm down, Harmon.
2702280	2703280	All right.
2703280	2704280	So the lights can go down.
2704280	2705280	Everybody can relax.
2705280	2710280	I'll come back out there in a second, because I don't have anything to say up here either.
2710280	2714280	Levy, did you enjoy emotionally sabotaging me?
2714280	2715280	Yeah.
2715280	2716280	Yeah.
2716280	2718280	Did you enjoy your birthday cake, Levy?
2718280	2719280	Wait.
2719280	2721280	Did you get to have any of it?
2721280	2722280	How was it?
2722280	2723280	Was it good?
2723280	2724280	Oh, you never?
2724280	2725280	You gave it a pancake?
2725280	2726280	No, no.
2726280	2727280	I actually had the one slice that was taken out.
2727280	2728280	Yeah, the one slice.
2728280	2729280	Yeah.
2729280	2730280	It was good.
2730280	2731280	All right.
2731280	2736280	Well, there's another person here that our friend Levi on Twitter was tweeting me about.
2736280	2737280	Who is it?
2737280	2738280	This guy?
2738280	2739280	Thanks.
2739280	2741160	It's a drummer that fell 100 feet onto his face.
2741160	2742960	That's how I was introduced to you by legend.
2742960	2744280	Do you want to come up and share your story?
2744280	2745280	Oh, man.
2745280	2746280	I like that part of it is being a drummer.
2746280	2747280	How's it going?
2747280	2748280	I got a mic, sir.
2748280	2749280	I have a seat there.
2749280	2750280	Hello?
2750280	2751280	I'm Luke.
2751280	2752280	Luke?
2752280	2753280	Yep.
2753280	2754280	Yep.
2754280	2755280	So really, that's all I got.
2755280	2756280	Levi said, you got to bring this guy up.
2756280	2757280	He's a drummer.
2757280	2758280	He fell 100 feet onto his face.
2758280	2759280	Yeah.
2759280	2760280	Levi would be here.
2760280	2761280	But he's doing a play.
2761280	2762280	He's directing one.
2762280	2763280	12 Angry Men in the coconut.
2763280	2764280	Right.
2764280	2765280	So that's pretty cool.
2765280	2766280	Levi, are Levi from Harmony?
2766280	2767280	Yeah.
2767280	2768280	No Shoes Levi for all the cast or listeners.
2768280	2769280	No Shoes Levi.
2769280	2770280	Love him or hate him.
2770280	2771280	He's controversial.
2771280	2772280	He's Levi.
2772280	2773280	Yeah.
2773280	2774280	He's a great dude.
2774280	2775280	We're all here.

2793280	2794280	Great lady.
2794280	2795280	Great lady.
2795280	2796280	Yeah.

2797280	2798280	Yeah.
2798280	2799280	Yeah.
2799280	2800280	She.
2800280	2801280	Oh, I'm sorry.
2801280	2802280	I do it all the time.
2802280	2803280	We've gone to the point where you can say guy dude, man.
2803280	2804280	It's all good.
2804280	2805280	Thank you for letting me off the hook.
2805280	2806280	That's the old woman way.
2806280	2807280	Thank you.
2807280	2808280	We don't have to remember anything.
2808280	2809280	Yeah.
2809280	2810280	Everyone.
2810280	2811280	I met him as a guy too.
2811280	2812280	Yeah.
2812280	2813280	Me too.
2813280	2814280	Okay.
2814280	2815280	So the, met her as a guy.
2815280	2816280	What the fuck is my problem?
2816280	2817280	Yeah.
2817280	2818280	We don't care.
2818280	2819280	You're like, give me a break.
2819280	2820280	All right.
2820280	2821280	Don't tell us we don't care.
2821280	2822280	I'm nervous.
2822280	2823280	Now we're offended.
2823280	2824280	I'm sorry.
2824280	2825280	Sorry.
2825280	2826280	I offended you.
2826280	2827280	I'm not caring.
2827280	2828280	All right.
2828280	2829280	Well, you have a building.
2829280	2830280	How do you fall 100 feet out of your face?
2830280	2831280	Okay.
2831280	2832280	So let me set the scene.
2832280	2835280	As in Minneapolis is pitch black dark.
2835280	2838280	We're like, uh, you know, we're kind of bored.
2838280	2839280	It's a Friday.
2839280	2840280	There's no shows.
2840280	2841280	We didn't have any gigs.
2841280	2842280	So we're like, oh, it's going to go.
2842280	2843280	Let's go climb some tall buildings.
2843280	2846280	That's, you know, we do that on regular Thursdays and stuff.
2846280	2848280	So why not a Friday?
2848280	2849280	Whatever.
2849280	2850280	It's like 2 a.m.
2850280	2852280	Really, really dark, like I mentioned.
2852280	2855280	So we're climbing this ladder that doesn't stop.
2855280	2857280	And then we get to the top.
2857280	2858280	The ladder didn't stop?
2858280	2860280	It didn't feel like it was.
2860280	2861280	All right.
2861280	2862280	Anyway, I have a little bit of OCD.
2862280	2865280	There's like 92 steps like climbing.
2865280	2867280	And then we got to the top and we were walking.
2867280	2869280	And I didn't wait for the flashlight.
2869280	2870280	That was my first mistake.
2870280	2872280	The flashlights were behind me.
2872280	2874280	Two of our dudes, Marshall and Adam.
2875280	2880280	And there's like this, like a ceiling tile size hole in the top of this building.
2880280	2883280	And so I'm just walking and enjoying the cityscape.
2883280	2884280	Okay.
2884280	2885280	I was mixing a drink.
2885280	2887280	I thought I could multitask.
2887280	2888280	That's okay.
2888280	2889280	Are you in a cave?
2889280	2890280	Are you?
2890280	2891280	No, he was climbing.
2891280	2892280	You're in a cave.
2892280	2894280	Where is he climbing buildings?
2894280	2896280	You're on the outside of a building.
2896280	2898280	It's like a fire escape ladder?
2898280	2899280	Yep.
2899280	2900280	Okay.
2900280	2902280	It's an old abandoned green bin mill thing.
2902280	2903280	Okay.
2903280	2906280	But there's a hatch above you, right?
2906280	2907280	No hatch.
2907280	2908280	We were on the outside of the building.
2908280	2909280	Oh, it's a little opening.
2909280	2910280	Climbing?
2910280	2911280	Yeah.
2911280	2912280	And there's like several openings.
2912280	2917280	And afterwards I found out like eight other people had also fallen and only one survived.
2917280	2920280	Oh, I thought you meant that moment.
2920280	2921280	No, no.
2921280	2922280	There wasn't a party on the roof.
2922280	2927280	Later on I found out I was actually the most fortunate person in this incident.
2927280	2928280	Yeah.
2928280	2930280	One of the most fortunate people I should say.
2930280	2932280	And that you had said, let's all do this.
2932280	2933280	And that everyone else was gone.
2933280	2934280	Yeah.
2934280	2935280	Now it's a thing.
2935280	2936280	Everyone's still doing it.
2936280	2937280	It was dark.
2937280	2938280	There was a hole in the ceiling.
2938280	2939280	Yep.
2939280	2940280	And you fell through it.
2940280	2941280	Straight through.
2941280	2942280	A hundred feet.
2942280	2943280	I tried to put my arms out.
2943280	2944280	Like everything.
2944280	2946280	Like the sky dived down.
2946280	2948280	How long did it take?
2948280	2949280	So it felt like it took forever.
2949280	2952280	But at the same time it was happening so fast.
2952280	2954280	It's really like time is really a thing.
2954280	2955280	Yeah.
2955280	2956280	When you're falling, it's crazy.
2956280	2957280	You know, you like missed the last step.
2957280	2958280	You're like, oh my God.
2958280	2959280	Oh, okay.
2959280	2960280	Yeah.
2960280	2961280	There's no grounded man.
2961280	2962280	It's just.
2962280	2965280	I just want to be clear about this.
2965280	2967280	You crawled up a ladder on the outside of a building.
2967280	2970280	And the reason you fell is because as you thought you got to the top of the
2970280	2975280	building, what should have been walking on the roof.
2975280	2976280	And then there's a hole.
2976280	2977280	Yeah, there's a hole.
2977280	2978280	And you shot straight down it.
2978280	2979280	Yep.
2979280	2980280	I just want to be clear about that.
2980280	2981280	Yeah.
2981280	2984280	So you're falling down through just empty building.
2984280	2985280	Yeah.
2985280	2987280	The only thing I could think of was like a spike was just waiting for me.
2987280	2990280	And I was going to get like gains the throne type of crap through my back.
2990280	2994280	That's like, I mean, there's such a good chance that there's not a pillow at
2994280	2995280	the bottom.
2995280	2996280	Where are you?
2996280	2997280	Yeah, for sure.
2997280	2998280	I was praying for water.
2998280	2999280	Be watertight.
2999280	3002280	A luxurious pool with an olive.
3002280	3004280	No, it's much worse than that.
3004280	3007280	So you're facing, were you facing up as you were falling?
3007280	3013280	No, I was, I was like, you know, arms in the air, baby don't care what did.
3013280	3016280	But anyway, I was like, ah, you know, and then I turned down for what?
3016280	3017280	Yeah.
3017280	3020280	Well, everything at that point, but so like a polaroid picture.
3020280	3021280	Yeah.
3021280	3022280	Yeah.
3022280	3023280	These are all things that go through your head.
3023280	3024280	What if I could?
3024280	3025280	No.
3025280	3029280	So I, um, I hit my feet and I'm like, normally I roll out because I skateboard and I like,
3029280	3031280	you know, jump off, you know, roasts and stuff and roll out.
3031280	3032280	You like compress your fall.
3032280	3033280	You see.
3033280	3034280	Yeah.
3034280	3035280	Yeah.
3035280	3036280	Urban ninjas do that kind of combat.
3036280	3037280	I mean, I don't know.
3037280	3039280	So you're saying you learned from skateboarding that you should like curl.
3039280	3040280	Yeah.
3040280	3041280	I learned how to fall.
3041280	3042280	Yeah.
3042280	3043280	When you fall.
3043280	3044280	Yeah.
3044280	3047280	You put your knees together and you turn to the side.
3047280	3048280	He knows what I'm talking about.
3048280	3049280	So that's what I did.
3049280	3051880	But you forgot that other safety instruction.
3051880	3056880	Don't climb up a hundred feet of ladder without like a rope or something.
3056880	3062560	You're falling now through a hundred feet of space to a dark is anywhere from like 60
3062560	3063560	to a hundred feet.
3063560	3067080	It was never actually like measured out, you know, we didn't really screw that.
3067080	3068080	So all right.
3068080	3070360	So, but really you hit your face first.
3070360	3071360	No, not my face.
3071360	3072760	I, um, but I did it.
3072760	3073760	That's what the report said.
3073760	3077880	I know how, you know, the social media is like, I know when really, if you adorably
3077880	3082400	fell on your little took us and you were like, Oh, I took that tickles broke in the process.
3082400	3086480	I like try to roll out and it's like a concave concrete.
3086480	3089840	So the bottom of it, so it's like a funnel up the end.
3089840	3094800	And so I'm rolling into like a wall of concrete that's like, you know, slanted like a skate
3094800	3097800	ramp, but not as much fun.
3097800	3099480	I thought you landed on your face.
3099480	3102240	I smashed my knee, which broke my knee.
3102240	3104880	Did you roll into it and come up and pull a frontside fakie?
3104880	3106120	No, I wish I try.
3106120	3110000	I was trying to rock and roll and just get out of it, you know, so it didn't change about
3110000	3111000	your life after that.
3111000	3112000	I mean, starting with injuries.
3112000	3115000	Well, I mean, I mean, now I have PTSD and stuff.
3115000	3116000	Did you get fucked up?
3116000	3117000	Did you, did you break?
3117000	3118000	Oh yeah.
3118000	3120000	I like my beamers like broke like this.
3120000	3125120	I don't know how you like, he's making a gesture that's like Mr. Burns, if he missed his fingers
3125120	3126920	while trying to tend to them.
3126920	3127920	Yeah.
3127920	3128920	Yeah.
3128920	3129920	I think they call it interlacing.
3129920	3130920	Not excellent.
3130920	3131920	Yeah.
3132600	3135400	So if Mr. Burns tried to say something, it was excellent and then it wasn't, it just
3135400	3136400	went.
3136400	3137400	No.
3137400	3139800	So like a gear is meshing together your beamers.
3139800	3140800	Yeah.
3140800	3142800	So just your basic, you're talking about like a bone that's like.
3142800	3146280	Like so much force is like.
3146280	3147280	Like lightning patterns.
3147280	3150080	And it couldn't break any more than it was breaking.
3150080	3151680	So it decided to break my pelvis.
3151680	3152680	Right.
3152680	3153680	My pelvis is like.
3153680	3154680	Let's not blame the bone.
3154680	3156680	I think it's all.
3157440	3160440	Some of these, you know, some of these.
3160440	3162440	I hate the game.
3162440	3165040	Sometimes it's the reverse, our president said.
3165040	3166040	Sometimes it's the beamers fault.
3166040	3167040	Let the hip break.
3167040	3168040	And I had like one beard.
3168040	3169040	They only had one beard that night.
3169040	3170040	I shouldn't say that.
3170040	3171440	So your pelvis got sheared or shattered or what happened there?
3171440	3172440	Yeah.
3172440	3176160	So then my pelvis broke and I didn't even realize that this bottom part broke because
3176160	3181400	I was like, I was all focused on when my face hit, you know, and I was like, yeah, because
3181400	3183400	your face, your face is your fortune.
3183400	3184400	Yeah.
3184400	3185400	Like, I mean, not really anymore.
3185400	3187400	You don't see all the weird stuff under there.
3187400	3189000	Oh, you have like scarring under your beard.
3189000	3190000	A little bit.
3190000	3191000	Yeah.
3191000	3192000	I did think I'm glad for you.
3192000	3193000	There's a camera I should look at.
3193000	3194000	There's like this.
3194000	3195000	You see that?
3195000	3196000	I can see.
3196000	3197000	Yeah.
3197000	3198000	I can see a scar.
3198000	3199000	You're pointing at it.
3199000	3200000	Yeah.
3200000	3201160	Were you a mess of blood and guts at the bottom?
3201160	3202160	Oh, man.
3202160	3203960	It was blood, guts, mud.
3203960	3206000	There's bones sticking out here.
3206000	3207000	Both hinges.
3207000	3208000	My jaw.
3208000	3209000	I like all these teeth.
3209000	3210000	These are fake.
3210000	3211000	Check.
3211000	3212000	Check out my old dentures.
3212000	3214960	I can take out the ones I got on now too.
3215560	3217560	I can verify here's a bag of teeth with them.
3217560	3218560	Check it out.
3218560	3220560	They're not the ones.
3220560	3221560	Those, yeah.
3221560	3223560	So, Harman Town first.
3223560	3225560	Table 52 for 200 bucks.
3225560	3227560	These teeth can be yours.
3227560	3228560	Yeah.
3228560	3229560	One roll of the dice.
3229560	3231560	Because these are like over a thousand a piece.
3231560	3232560	It's ridiculous.
3232560	3233560	Yeah.
3233560	3234560	And I had to get two.
3234560	3236560	You're walking around and talking like you're losing
3236560	3237560	the Christmas goose ride.
3237560	3238560	Yeah.
3238560	3239560	Isn't that crazy?
3239560	3240560	You're very lucky.
3240560	3241560	I mean, just looking at you.
3241560	3242560	Oh, yeah.
3242560	3243560	Whatever's going on internally, you must get a lot of pain probably.
3243560	3246160	At one point, they said I was paralyzed in the hospital.
3246160	3248160	And I was like, I wouldn't take that as a yes answer.
3248160	3249160	I was like, no, Matt.
3249160	3250160	They're like, you can't move your legs.
3250160	3251160	I was like, yeah, I can't.
3251160	3252160	They're like, no, you can't.
3252160	3253160	I was like, fuck you.
3253160	3256160	So, if you're paralyzed and you're listening, fucking suck it up, Buttercup.
3256160	3257160	Not really though.
3257160	3258160	Not really.
3258160	3259160	I know you didn't mean that.
3259160	3265160	But I always think that when they show things where it's like the kid fights cancer and
3265160	3268160	then overcomes it, I'm like, well, what if your kid doesn't, like, what are you supposed
3268160	3270160	to be like, well, I should go fuck myself?
3270160	3272160	Like, I didn't work hard enough to.
3272160	3273160	Oh, yeah.
3274160	3276160	I didn't think positively enough.
3276160	3277160	Like, I deserve cancer.
3277160	3278160	Okay.
3278160	3279160	Sorry.
3279160	3281160	But, no, you're very lucky.
3281160	3286160	Because I expected, I fully expected, and I was, you know, like he said, you fell 100
3286160	3287160	feet under your face.
3287160	3288160	And I thought, oh, yeah.
3288160	3293160	This is good because I want to punish, like, anybody who thinks that, like, the performing
3293160	3295160	should have to do with looking like Jeff, you know?
3295160	3297160	Like, I want to show.
3297160	3298160	He's a gorgeous lad.
3298160	3302160	Like, I want a new standard of beauty to be reality.
3302160	3305160	But then you came up and you're all good looking and you just fell on your face.
3305160	3306160	I can show you some deformity.
3306160	3307160	Okay.
3307160	3308160	Well, show us deformity.
3308160	3309160	All right.
3309160	3310160	Why we're here.
3310160	3313160	But for the people not watching, he looks like he could have been, like, in the Almond
3313160	3314160	Brothers or the Eagles.
3314160	3315160	Like, he looks like...
3315160	3316160	Just the hair.
3316160	3318160	Just the hair.
3318160	3319160	Maybe.
3319160	3320160	I don't know.
3320160	3321160	The headband.
3321160	3322160	Yeah.
3322160	3323160	What's the deformity you're going to show us?
3323160	3326160	Do you want to try to do the mic up close so you can hear it and everything?
3326160	3327160	Oh, this is the teeth thing.
3327160	3328160	Right.
3328160	3329160	Okay.
3329160	3330160	Well, okay.
3330160	3331160	You're going to pull out your bridge.
3331160	3332160	Okay.
3332160	3333160	Oh, no.
3333160	3334160	It's more than a bridge.
3334160	3335160	Okay.
3335160	3336160	All right.
3336160	3337160	Well, it's...
3337160	3338160	Okay.
3338160	3339160	Oh, oh.
3339160	3340160	Wait.
3340160	3341160	Show me.
3341160	3342160	Show me, Luke.
3342160	3343160	Good choice.
3343160	3344160	Oh.
3344160	3345160	Oh, God.
3345160	3346160	What on earth is happening?
3346160	3347160	You have a...
3347160	3348160	There's, like, a bottom.
3348160	3349160	There's a separate one.
3349160	3350160	Oh.
3350160	3352160	His mouth is like a Sarlacc pit.
3352160	3353160	Oh.
3353160	3354160	Like, yeah.
3354160	3355160	You're...
3355160	3356160	Didn't you kill both of them?
3356160	3357160	Just the front teeth are just all gone.
3357160	3358160	Just gone.
3358160	3359160	So I have to take these out when I eat.
3359160	3360160	We're still growing bone density.
3360160	3362160	These have way more gums on them.
3362160	3364160	Like, they're building the gums back up.
3364160	3365160	So, yeah.
3365160	3366160	We had to do another surgery here.
3366160	3371160	They, like, popped out my leg and scraped out some bone marrow and just shoved it in there
3371160	3372160	with some animal dead stuff.
3372160	3373160	Whoa.
3373160	3374160	Have we...
3374160	3375160	I mean, I've knocked on wood.
3375160	3378160	I mean, eventually something's going to happen to me, and it'll be the worst thing of all,
3378160	3381160	because I don't have the balls to climb a ladder, so I won't have the cool thing falling
3381160	3382160	on my face.
3382160	3383160	And, like...
3383160	3387160	But all of us eventually learn that the human body is, like...
3387160	3389160	It's just, like, a 57 Chevy.
3389160	3392160	They start telling me, like, we're going to take a muscle from your ass and put it on
3392160	3393160	your head.
3393160	3395160	Just, like, everything clicks and cracks now when I wake up in the morning.
3395160	3396160	I'm, like, stretching out.
3396160	3397160	It's, like...
3397160	3400160	So Levi had also tweeted...
3400160	3403160	He said, you have feelings you want to share.
3403160	3404160	I don't want to put you on the spot.
3404160	3405160	Yeah, kind of.
3405160	3406160	Like, it's more than just using...
3406160	3407160	There's always more details.
3407160	3409160	Usually it's not so enlightening like this.
3409160	3412160	Usually I start getting on teary-eyed and, like, yo, it was going to come up for five
3412160	3413160	days.
3413160	3415160	And then there were five days I couldn't walk or speak.
3415160	3417160	I didn't remember my dad's name.
3417160	3418160	It just gets depressing.
3418160	3420160	Well, we know that that's rough to go through.
3420160	3421160	Oh, for sure.
3421160	3422160	We'll get the coma thing.
3422160	3423160	Yeah, the coma's no fun.
3423160	3425160	But, like, the worst part is remembering it all.
3425160	3427160	They're always, like, oh, you're going to forget.
3427160	3431160	And, like, your brain blocks pain after so much time.
3431160	3433160	But, like, I don't know, man.
3433160	3434160	I still wake up in night tears.
3434160	3438160	I didn't know what Kanye West was talking about when he first came out with that song.
3438160	3440160	But now I think I get it, dude.
3440160	3441160	What did he fall through?
3441160	3443160	Sometimes you have to fall 100 feet.
3443160	3444160	He just said something about night tears.
3444160	3447160	Sometimes you have to fall 100 feet and land on your face to find out what Kanye is
3447160	3451160	talking about.
3451160	3453160	He'd be happy to know that.
3453160	3456160	A guy just fell on his face and was in a coma.
3456160	3458160	He woke up and he's like, what?
3458160	3459160	Oh, yeah, okay.
3459160	3462160	Anyways, the, but, shit, shit, shit.
3462160	3463160	Wait, what was I going to say?
3463160	3464160	It was on the tip of my tongue.
3464160	3466160	Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck it.
3466160	3467160	Fuck it.
3467160	3468160	Fuck it.
3468160	3469160	Bad show.
3469160	3470160	Bad show.
3470160	3471160	That's a good show.
3471160	3472160	Thank you.
3472160	3473160	Thank you.
3473160	3474160	Oh, I know what I was going to ask.
3475160	3477160	There was this lady.
3477160	3484160	There was a lady on forensic files and she faked getting knocked out by an intruder who
3484160	3488160	then took her baby and killed it because she wanted to kill the baby.
3488160	3492160	And she had this, so part of her story was he came in and he karate chopped me.
3492160	3495160	And I don't remember anything after that and all this stuff.
3495160	3499160	And so they went into this whole thing about like when you have a trauma that rattles your
3499160	3501160	brain enough to knock you out.
3501160	3507160	It's scientifically, like it's a fact that the moments before that trauma are, was there
3507160	3510160	a while when you had no idea what was happening?
3510160	3511160	What had happened?
3511160	3512160	Oh, for sure.
3512160	3513160	For sure.
3513160	3514160	There's more details, too.
3514160	3518160	Like when they had to come and get me, it took them two hours to find where I was.
3518160	3523160	So I'm like at the bottom of this hole, I got a tooth that went so far up my gum.
3523160	3525160	It was coming out of my bottom of my nose right here.
3525160	3526160	Like you could feel the wall.
3526160	3528160	I have to check in with somebody.
3528160	3530160	Luana, what was your name again?
3530160	3531160	I'm sorry.
3531160	3532160	Luana.
3532160	3533160	We're seats in the house, right?
3533160	3534160	Yeah.
3534160	3535160	Okay.
3535160	3536160	All right.
3536160	3537160	See you.
3537160	3538160	Bye.
3538160	3539160	I was like, I can't see you.
3539160	3540160	So I think, okay.
3540160	3541160	You're like, you're tweeting.
3541160	3542160	Like $15.
3542160	3543160	Fuck you.
3543160	3546160	Luana, I'll get you a stool.
3546160	3547160	There was...
3547160	3549160	Let's bring Luana up.
3549160	3551160	It's her whole table.
3551160	3553160	She'll be a representative.
3553160	3555160	They could switch.
3555160	3557160	Also, Luana, you know you don't have to come up.
3557160	3560160	In case you fell, you're like, I paid $15.
3560160	3561160	I went to the show.
3561160	3562160	I couldn't see it.
3562160	3564160	Then they brought me up and humiliated me.
3564160	3568160	I'll scoot over here.
3568160	3570160	All right.
3570160	3571160	So, all right.
3571160	3573160	Fell on your face.
3573160	3574160	Okay, good.
3574160	3577160	Oh, and he said you had a rap.
3577160	3578160	I do.
3578160	3581160	I have like an emotional rap that I made about it.
3581160	3585160	It also is like some of it's calling you out, Dan, but not personally.
3585160	3586160	Oh shit.
3586160	3588160	I love to be called out when it's not personal.
3588160	3589160	It's not personal.
3589160	3590160	So it's just about my work.
3590160	3591160	Wait, is it just business?
3591160	3592160	It's just business.
3592160	3593160	Yeah.
3593160	3594160	It's just business.
3594160	3597160	That's my least sensitive area.
3597160	3598160	That's why I do what I do.
3598160	3603160	I listen to the podcast all the way through so often at work, I became a little paranoid
3603160	3604160	and I thought you were talking about me.
3604160	3605160	Oh.
3605160	3607160	I thought you remembered me from a show way long ago.
3607160	3609160	I'm glad you don't because I made a fool of myself.
3609160	3610160	Oh, no.
3610160	3611160	Wait, so you really...
3611160	3613160	Tell me about that experience.
3613160	3614160	Yeah.
3614160	3615160	You met me after a show.
3615160	3621160	You might not remember because you're kind of angry and I don't want to say anything
3621160	3622160	bad.
3622160	3624160	I'm going to in the rap.
3624160	3625160	Okay.
3625160	3626160	Well, what...
3626160	3627160	Yeah.
3627160	3628160	I wrote it down though.
3628160	3629160	Where did you meet Dan the first time?
3629160	3630160	Where was this?
3630160	3631160	I was in Chicago.
3631160	3632160	Yeah.
3632160	3633160	Okay.
3633160	3634160	So we were on tour during the...
3634160	3635160	Was this on stage or off stage?
3635160	3636160	Off stage.
3636160	3637160	So what you're saying?
3637160	3638160	Like what?
3638160	3639160	I met you?
3639160	3640160	I was in a bad mood?
3640160	3641160	Yeah.
3641160	3642160	You're like...
3642160	3643160	I don't remember word for word, but you weren't happy.
3644160	3645160	You told me I was blacklisted.
3645160	3648160	I was never welcome back again.
3648160	3651160	To the venue in Chicago?
3651160	3652160	That could have been it.
3652160	3653160	What?
3653160	3657160	I don't know that this happened.
3657160	3659160	Now I don't know if I won that craps game.
3659160	3660160	What's going on?
3660160	3661160	What do you think blacklisted?
3661160	3664160	When did I use that phrase casually?
3664160	3666160	Dan told you you were blacklisted?
3666160	3667160	Yeah, like 69.
3667160	3669160	You were 69s?
3669160	3672160	Oh, I'm sorry, 86.
3673160	3678160	You may have misinterpreted an experimental phase of my...
3680160	3684160	I go on tour and I think, let's try some stuff.
3684160	3686160	You thought I was blacklisting you.
3686160	3689160	Sometimes Dan likes to 69 as a dude.
3689160	3690160	I got sexual.
3690160	3694160	Okay, so you felt 86, not 69, right Dan?
3694160	3695160	Twice.
3695160	3696160	Because he was in a bad mood.
3696160	3698160	From my Twitter feed?
3698160	3700160	I don't remember.
3701160	3702160	But you wrote a rap about it.
3702160	3704160	That's why I don't think it happened.
3704160	3705160	No offense.
3705160	3708160	Also, did it happen before or after you fell?
3708160	3709160	It happened after I fell.
3709160	3710160	Okay, great.
3710160	3711160	Good to know.
3711160	3714160	I was also like this, and I was like, really mean,
3714160	3716160	and you couldn't see through my teeth,
3716160	3717160	and you were talking about my brain,
3717160	3719160	and you'd be like, what is he saying?
3719160	3720160	Oh, okay.
3720160	3722160	That's probably why.
3722160	3724160	I didn't have a smile like I did today.
3724160	3727160	I bullied a differently abled person in Chicago.
3727160	3728160	No, you didn't.
3728160	3731160	I told them that they were blacklisted from life,
3731160	3737160	and characterized it as mutually filleting each other.
3737160	3740160	And you wrote this rap to...
3740160	3741160	Do you want to beat?
3741160	3742160	You just want to do it?
3742160	3743160	I don't know.
3743160	3744160	It's more like a...
3744160	3745160	I could give you a beat.
3745160	3747160	I wrote it on Thursday.
3747160	3749160	My parents were like, don't go.
3749160	3751160	You're scared of him, and I was like...
3751160	3753160	How are you?
3753160	3754160	Hi, I want to...
3754160	3755160	Welcome to hell.
3755160	3757160	Yeah, thank you.
3757160	3758160	I don't know if this is on.
3758160	3759160	Is this on?
3759160	3760160	Yeah.
3760160	3761160	Oh, wow.
3761160	3763160	I got this little shorter rap,
3763160	3764160	and then like a longer rap.
3764160	3766160	Okay, he's pulled out a tiny notebook.
3766160	3767160	Just a bunch of pages.
3767160	3768160	Wait, wait, let's hear the short one,
3768160	3771160	and maybe we'll want to hear the long one.
3771160	3772160	Yeah, would you like to?
3772160	3774160	And the crowd went mild.
3774160	3776160	I'll do the flipping.
3776160	3778160	Okay, this is...
3778160	3779160	Can I hold that?
3779160	3781160	I'd feel much more comfortable if I could hold that.
3781160	3782160	Yeah, yeah, you want to hold it?
3782160	3784160	Yeah, yeah.
3785160	3788160	Luanna's blog entry is getting better by the minute.
3788160	3789160	Sorry, I was just hoping I had something to do with it.
3789160	3791160	I started from the beginning, I guess,
3791160	3794160	the short one, I think, where the pencil marks stop
3794160	3795160	and the pen begins.
3795160	3797160	This is just the short one.
3797160	3799160	Okay, we'll start here, and we'll just go.
3799160	3800160	You can just stop whenever.
3800160	3801160	All right.
3801160	3802160	This one's not about the fall,
3802160	3803160	because it's a little shorter.
3803160	3805160	It's just about, like, you know, shit.
3805160	3807160	Is this about you hitting Dan Harmon, or just...
3807160	3808160	No, this one's just random.
3808160	3809160	Not this one.
3809160	3810160	We'll save that one for the long time.
3810160	3811160	I want to hear...
3811160	3812160	Maybe I'll tweak it.
3812160	3815160	We only signed up for one rap.
3815160	3819160	No, we want to hear how Dan Harmon hurt you.
3819160	3820160	Okay, I was really angry,
3820160	3822160	and there's this new strain of paranoia
3822160	3825160	that came out in a tokable form.
3825160	3827160	All right.
3827160	3828160	Let's see here.
3828160	3829160	All right, you guys ready?
3829160	3830160	Yeah, I mean, yes.
3830160	3832160	Just because it's now plugged in under your name
3832160	3834160	after you already achieved mainstream
3834160	3837160	doesn't mean you can claim fame and truly belongs to me.
3837160	3839160	You're a part of a bigger hypocrisy,
3839160	3840160	as far as you can see.
3840160	3841160	This is the need to be.
3841160	3842160	Time to be free.
3842160	3843160	Page turn.
3843160	3845160	Because morality is immortality.
3845160	3848160	I will rise above this, and what you should trust is
3848160	3849160	the words coming out my mouth is.
3849160	3851160	It's not served with sauerkraut.
3851160	3854160	That shit is about foreskin with your next akin.
3854160	3855160	That was disgusting.
3855160	3856160	I know you know what I mean.
3856160	3858160	Talking sausage about all these postings,
3858160	3862160	now dissecting what has already been posted...
3862160	3863160	Spoken.
3863160	3864160	There we go.
3864160	3865160	Spoken out.
3865160	3867160	Now here I so loud took everything I had,
3867160	3868160	and I hope you're happy now.
3868160	3869160	You changed to be all right.
3869160	3872160	Someday flight behind you.
3872160	3874160	On the true night, not forever been signed to.
3874160	3875160	Nothing to no one.
3875160	3877160	Sounded once in the coma.
3877160	3878160	Never had...
3878160	3881160	Never had money to keep a honey or a honeypot.
3881160	3883160	I'm seriously turning me down.
3883160	3884160	Nope, not now.
3884160	3886160	Far as I said, a PC child,
3886160	3889160	and shit goes wild once you hear the sincere queer
3889160	3890160	step to this mic.
3890160	3892160	Not for telling my might,
3892160	3894160	but the most horrible whores.
3894160	3896160	One that make me my own orders.
3896160	3899160	All the clouds I resonate through as I incriminate you,
3899160	3901160	because I ain't got nothing to lose.
3901160	3903160	Talk about falling down on your nose.
3903160	3906160	It's just as red as the clown of my neighborhood.
3906160	3907160	You know it sounds good.
3907160	3909160	So why can't you write your own shit
3909160	3911160	instead of being a beep?
3911160	3914160	Behaving worse than a clit,
3914160	3916160	one of which I had no a part of.
3916160	3918160	Because I'm starting up my own rapper's world,
3918160	3920160	one which you won't be a part of.
3920160	3923160	You already know your own ones won't drive your own car
3923160	3926160	because you're more addicted to those screens
3926160	3928160	that you're most likely will never escape be.
3928160	3930160	No, I'm not talking about it all the time.
3930160	3932160	I would tell you a story not once,
3932160	3934160	but twice as sure me you did everything all right.
3934160	3937160	Well, got ready to prepare the ice right here.
3937160	3938160	Day three.
3938160	3939160	Because you got the need after the fight.
3939160	3941160	No, I'm not going to be nice.
3941160	3943160	Everyone I talked to had the chance to.
3943160	3944160	Provisions are low.
3944160	3946160	Especially when I was held up in bed,
3946160	3949160	never even fed nothing but this shit through a tube.
3949160	3951160	Said it's really good for you, but hold up.
3951160	3952160	Let's rewind.
3952160	3954160	Fell a little more than two stories, bitch, please.
3954160	3956160	Posted up my left leg, you see.
3956160	3958160	The blast struck straight through my knee,
3958160	3959160	through the femur so far.
3959160	3961160	You know I go so hard.
3961160	3963160	After my femur was flux,
3963160	3964160	splintered on through.
3964160	3965160	Next was my cover source.
3965160	3966160	We're approaching the summit.
3966160	3969160	And Elvis ever spit rapping, making shit fall of fame.
3969160	3971160	What you got to say better when you spit your own shit.
3971160	3972160	Our guides have died.
3972160	3973160	No, not your hair.
3973160	3975160	Doesn't mean in there trying to ninja roll out.
3975160	3976160	And I let out a shout.
3976160	3977160	Ah!
3977160	3978160	Couldn't make it through.
3978160	3979160	I tried to tuck and roll.
3979160	3981160	Let's just say I never made it to the show.
3981160	3983160	Yeah, I bet you already know.
3983160	3984160	Judge me by my teeth.
3984160	3986160	I had something more frightening than lightning
3986160	3988160	for fucked up face.
3988160	3989160	Worse than any mace.
3989160	3991160	Head backs bounced back so high.
3991160	3993160	Fell out my left eye.
3993160	3996160	Broke up my over, upper and lower chompers.
3996160	3997160	Couldn't see for weeks.
3997160	3998160	Stole my shit while I was weak.
3998160	3999160	You can take out your breakfast menus right now.
3999160	4001160	So I said wouldn't it be nice if this person
4001160	4002160	and that person would join in.
4002160	4004160	But now I know the truth, and that's the truth.
4004160	4005160	This ain't within you.
4005160	4007160	Imagine if I took something from you,
4007160	4008160	you'd jump up through the roof.
4008160	4009160	You have.
4009160	4010160	More than you spoof, go poof.
4010160	4012160	It gets a little better as it goes on.
4012160	4013160	I laid it all out.
4013160	4014160	We're halfway done.
4014160	4015160	We're halfway done, you guys.
4015160	4018160	Now it's dressing and others that want to bling.
4018160	4020160	Repeating the words as I move towards words.
4020160	4022160	Country all the things you see through the TV
4022160	4024160	or the internet where most of our time is spent.
4024160	4026160	Once said I couldn't rhyme like that.
4026160	4028160	But that was in reference to my presence.
4028160	4030160	And now I know you see the truth,
4030160	4031160	and you should be free trouble too.
4031160	4034160	For one day, you will slip, and I will be on top of it.
4034160	4035160	No, it's not just a zip.
4035160	4036160	Jesus Christ.
4037160	4039160	Even though you already know what I'm talking about.
4039160	4042160	Say fuck you on this fine day.
4042160	4044160	Hate it when you call my friends phone number.
4044160	4045160	I memorize the ringtone.
4045160	4047160	Y'all know the bones.
4047160	4048160	Don't try and burn it.
4048160	4049160	I told you.
4049160	4050160	I told you twice, and it's all right.
4050160	4051160	You're insane.
4051160	4052160	The drunken hall of fame.
4052160	4053160	What a shame.
4053160	4055160	You know you know what it's about me,
4055160	4056160	and when it's about you,
4056160	4059160	there's no reason for you to recover the old track.
4059160	4060160	You never want to go back.
4060160	4063160	Afraid of the new hashtag with your name on it.
4063160	4064160	Maybe you should try up on it.
4064160	4065160	Suck your thumb again,
4065160	4067160	because I know you a pelican crew.
4067160	4068160	One-hit-wonder-boy.
4068160	4070160	I wonder who else can rap out seven minutes
4070160	4072160	about somebody else's business.
4072160	4075160	Just to be your true self, maybe I do.
4075160	4076160	Hold on.
4076160	4077160	Maybe I do see you some help.
4077160	4078160	All right.
4078160	4079160	But not getting your bitch out.
4079160	4080160	We're even.
4080160	4081160	We're even.
4081160	4082160	We're even.
4082160	4083160	Uncle.
4083160	4084160	Uncle.
4084160	4085160	It gets even better.
4085160	4086160	I think we're less than halfway through.
4086160	4087160	All right.
4087160	4088160	Let's hear it for Luke, everybody.
4088160	4089160	That was fucking good.
4089160	4090160	Thank you.
4090160	4091160	Thank you.
4091160	4092160	We're not.
4092160	4093160	We're not.
4093160	4094160	It gets darker.
4094160	4095160	A little harder.
4095160	4096160	We're going to close this show
4096160	4097160	by him reading Beowulf.
4097160	4098160	Should we do it another day?
4098160	4099160	Jesus Christ.
4099160	4100160	Thank you very much.
4100160	4101160	That's all that's allowed to put out there.
4101160	4102160	You're welcome.
4102160	4103160	And, like, yeah.
4103160	4104160	I mean, I'm going to...
4104160	4107160	I didn't get to the mud and the blood part, but...
4107160	4108160	Right.
4108160	4109160	Yeah.
4109160	4112160	I got hungry when you said sausage and saucy and sauerkraut.
4112160	4113160	Yeah.
4113160	4115160	That was the first page, Jeff.
4115160	4116160	Yes.
4116160	4117160	That's when I checked the fucking...
4117160	4119160	It's the monitors and, like, I'm 44,
4119160	4121160	but all I can get is the irony that it's like,
4121160	4124160	oh, it's a scathing indictment of someone who's abusing
4124160	4128160	the time that they are getting on stage.
4128160	4130160	Oh, my bad.
4130160	4131160	Well, it's just sort of like...
4131160	4133160	It's all I'm getting is that it's like...
4133160	4135160	Well, I was really scared to say it.
4135160	4136160	Well, you're up on stage,
4136160	4138160	and you're not mindful of the individuals listening.
4138160	4139160	I'm sorry.
4139160	4140160	There's people out there.
4140160	4142160	They're human beings and human beings and feelings,
4142160	4145160	and human beings are entitled to be entertained.
4145160	4146160	Oh, yeah.
4146160	4148160	I get to that.
4148160	4149160	Right.
4149160	4150160	You get to that, but you got to that.
4150160	4151160	You...
4151160	4154160	I mean, you now know what it's like to have stage time.
4154160	4157160	Like, you had an unequivocal fucking microphone,
4157160	4159160	like, focused on you.
4159160	4161160	But he would have been there for three hours.
4161160	4162160	No, there's...
4162160	4165160	What if somebody came up to you after that show,
4165160	4166160	after you did that for two hours?
4166160	4168160	What if somebody came up to you and, like,
4168160	4170160	I don't know what happened.
4170160	4172160	I've never said the word black list outside of a...
4172160	4174160	Yeah, I've never heard you say that.
4174160	4178160	But what if you had a dissatisfying encounter with somebody
4179160	4181160	after a show, and then what if that person, then,
4181160	4182160	was at your next show?
4182160	4183160	What if they were like,
4183160	4185160	I want to tell you about your show and the show,
4185160	4187160	and then you're like, well, it's hard to do a show,
4187160	4188160	because I don't know.
4188160	4191160	Oh, yeah, because this dude is rapping his bowels all the time.
4191160	4193160	Let's check in with LaJuana.
4193160	4195160	LaJuana, what did you think about that rap?
4200160	4201160	And I'm sorry.
4201160	4205160	It was long, and I wish you had a bigger book to write to me.
4205160	4206160	Oh, yeah, thanks.
4206160	4208160	Less page turns, yeah.
4208160	4209160	Understandable.
4209160	4210160	Yeah.
4210160	4212160	LaJuana, what's your deal?
4212160	4214160	What are you up to these days?
4214160	4220160	I am just here, because Dan Harmon.
4220160	4221160	Oh, really?
4221160	4222160	Yeah.
4222160	4223160	Where are you from?
4223160	4224160	Arkansas.
4224160	4225160	What part?
4225160	4226160	Fayetteville.
4226160	4227160	Fayetteville?
4227160	4228160	Yeah.
4228160	4229160	Do you go to school there?
4229160	4230160	Yeah.
4230160	4231160	Yeah?
4232160	4234160	And you drove down here?
4234160	4235160	Yeah.
4235160	4237160	My friend Markos did.
4237160	4238160	Markos?
4238160	4240160	Because my cars broke down right now.
4240160	4241160	Your car broke down?
4241160	4242160	Yeah.
4242160	4243160	Having transmission problems.
4243160	4246160	And I said, hey, I bought my ticket also.
4246160	4248160	Will you please let me drive with you?
4248160	4249160	Oh, for real?
4249160	4250160	Yeah.
4250160	4251160	That's awesome.
4251160	4252160	All right.
4252160	4254160	What's it like to be on stage next to Lucas?
4254160	4255160	Luke.
4255160	4256160	Luke.
4256160	4257160	That's good.
4257160	4260160	We're best friends now.
4260160	4263160	Well, let's have a hand for Luke,
4263160	4265160	because I want to keep the chairs rotating.
4265160	4266160	Let's have a hand for Luke.
4266160	4267160	Luke, everybody.
4267160	4268160	Thank you.
4268160	4269160	Thanks, Luke.
4269160	4270160	This freshman, Dan, that is rapping.
4270160	4276160	Luke, that was good shit, man.
4276160	4279160	Thank you, Luke, for your awesome rhymes and sharing.
4279160	4282160	I got to say, it takes a lot of courage to come up on stage
4282160	4286160	and admit that you were told never to come around him ever again.
4286160	4289160	Like, you could have just been pulled so quick,
4289160	4291160	and yet that was one of the first things,
4291160	4293160	like you said it pretty early.
4293160	4297160	But where's my medal for going, oh, interesting.
4297160	4299160	Carry on.
4299160	4303160	And where's their medal for being like, oh, thank you.
4303160	4305160	Here's my $15.
4305160	4306160	I was getting to that.
4306160	4308160	Please tell whoever you want to just say stuff.
4308160	4311160	Jesus Christ, what the fuck?
4311160	4313160	You're like a goddamn it.
4313160	4314160	I'm always there.
4314160	4316160	Wait, La Juana and Steve switched.
4316160	4319160	So La Juana, you're next to Dan, so you guys can convene here.
4320160	4322160	I don't want to argue all night, but she's fine.
4322160	4323160	Where she is, right?
4323160	4324160	She's comfy.
4324160	4325160	OK.
4325160	4326160	All right.
4326160	4327160	Sorry.
4327160	4329160	You 69'd Luke, but you wouldn't want to...
4329160	4330160	I offered.
4330160	4333160	I told him he was 69'd.
4333160	4334160	All right.
4334160	4339160	Like, let's balance it out.
4339160	4342160	Like, I want to...
4342160	4344160	This can't end well.
4344160	4345160	Thank you.
4345160	4347160	Actually, you know who if you...
4347160	4348160	You know who I...
4348160	4349160	You know who I...
4349160	4350160	Oh, I know.
4350160	4351160	What?
4351160	4352160	I know what you're thinking.
4352160	4353160	What?
4353160	4354160	He knows.
4354160	4355160	Don't question him.
4355160	4356160	What?
4356160	4357160	What are you...
4357160	4358160	Come on.
4358160	4359160	What are you...
4359160	4360160	You're asked about Lacey?
4360160	4361160	What?
4361160	4362160	Oh, you want me to...
4362160	4363160	Oh, I thought that's where you're going.
4363160	4364160	I wanted to...
4364160	4365160	I did want to bring up Sam, the sound guy.
4365160	4366160	Oh, you should.
4366160	4367160	You should.
4367160	4370160	I thought we were getting to know La Juana.
4370160	4371160	Let's...
4371160	4372160	Why is...
4372160	4373160	What the fuck is...
4373160	4374160	You don't have a show...
4374160	4376160	My whole show is shitting on you.
4376160	4377160	That's all I have.
4377160	4380160	We have a woman on station we haven't even spoken to,
4380160	4382160	and you want to start bringing up other people?
4382160	4383160	I...
4383160	4385160	La Juana doesn't want this kind of attention
4385160	4386160	any more than...
4386160	4387160	La Juana, okay.
4387160	4388160	I mean...
4388160	4389160	Yeah, I mean...
4389160	4390160	What else would you ask?
4390160	4391160	Huh?
4391160	4392160	What else would you ask me?
4392160	4393160	Okay.
4393160	4396160	She's already up here.
4396160	4399160	Dan, ask her an important question.
4399160	4402160	La Juana, what color is love?
4403160	4406160	It's a dark purple.
4406160	4407160	Nice.
4407160	4413160	I mean, she said that like she knows that that's the actual answer.
4413160	4414160	Scientific fact.
4414160	4415160	Do you have a favorite color?
4415160	4416160	Purple.
4416160	4417160	Is it dark purple?
4417160	4420160	Why is dark purple your favorite color?
4420160	4421160	Like, why is that love?
4421160	4422160	It just feels...
4422160	4423160	It feels like love to you?
4423160	4425160	My grandma used to wear dark purple.
4425160	4426160	Aww.
4427160	4428160	You loved her?
4428160	4429160	Yeah.
4429160	4430160	She's gone.
4430160	4431160	You said you did.
4431160	4433160	When did she go away?
4435160	4436160	I'm not good with dates.
4436160	4437160	This sounds really bad.
4437160	4439160	You're the symptom of the ADD.
4439160	4441160	La Juana, Dan has a wrap-up on your grandma.
4441160	4442160	Yeah!
4444160	4446160	How hard did you fuck her?
4448160	4450160	I'm gonna lock eyes with you so I...
4450160	4452160	La Juana's grandma was named Lydia.
4452160	4455160	He fucked her so hard, she got chlamydia.
4461160	4462160	Oh, Dan.
4462160	4463160	Right?
4463160	4465160	Seems like kind of an obvious place to go, but...
4465160	4466160	Yeah.
4466160	4468160	I would have been much more giving, I think.
4468160	4471160	Dan, you would have been much more nuanced about that.
4471160	4472160	Yeah, exactly.
4472160	4473160	I was gonna...
4473160	4474160	No.
4474160	4479160	What I was gonna do is I was hoping like I wanted to bring somebody else up that was like,
4479160	4484160	okay, what's the opposite of a guy that fell 100 feet onto his face and that has a wrap
4484160	4489160	about how I done him wrong, which would be somebody who maybe has anyone been launched
4489160	4496160	into the air 100 feet and or is very happy that they met me or something.
4496160	4497160	Just to...
4497160	4500160	It's just for me, it's just like I'd like to balance it.
4500160	4501160	We got people pointing at other people.
4501160	4502160	It's very curious to me.
4502160	4507160	Like, you're like, this guy loves you so much and he can fly.
4509160	4510160	Is it true?
4510160	4511160	Why is your friends pointing at you?
4511160	4516160	He thinks that you admire me and think that I'm an inspiring figure in your life.
4517160	4518160	Yes, it's true.
4518160	4519160	Yeah?
4520160	4522160	Would you tell me about it in front of people?
4525160	4528160	You don't have to, but if you would, it would make me feel better.
4530160	4532160	You can take the birthday seat.
4533160	4534160	Get the fuck out of here.
4534160	4535160	Will you get the fuck out of here?
4540160	4544160	He was born yesterday, so he could just sit where he was.
4547160	4550160	Hello, what's your name?
4550160	4551160	Tim.
4551160	4553160	Tim, and you're from Arkansas, I'm guessing.
4553160	4554160	From Arkansas.
4556160	4557160	I'm getting good at this.
4557160	4558160	All right.
4558160	4559160	Well, tell me.
4559160	4561160	Tell me how you love me.
4563160	4574160	I don't know if it's that astounding, but I'm just kind of a failed writer and I'm impressed
4575160	4576160	with your writing.
4576160	4579160	It's like you're the opposite of a skateboarder.
4580160	4582160	What didn't you write?
4586160	4588160	I've not written a lot of scripts.
4588160	4590160	Okay, scripts and screenplays and stuff, okay.
4590160	4591160	Yeah, a lot of poetry.
4591160	4592160	Cool.
4592160	4593160	Lou Anna, what's your...
4593160	4596160	When you say failed writer, Tim, you mean you failed how?
4597160	4599160	I just, I don't know what I mean.
4599160	4601160	I'm just, you know, I'm an introvert.
4601160	4602160	My friends made me come up here.
4602160	4603160	Well, you mean you don't want to call you the last...
4603160	4606160	You wrote, you write, and you're not Dan Harmon, is what you mean, right?
4606160	4607160	You're not like a...
4607160	4608160	Nobody wants to call himself a writer ever.
4608160	4615160	We were just talking about you at the table with my friends that I just met who are awesome.
4616160	4620160	They gave me this bumper sticker.
4621160	4622160	Oh, nice.
4622160	4624160	Harmon Town dicks tangent.
4624160	4625160	Right.
4627160	4629160	So, what were we talking about?
4629160	4630160	Oh, yeah.
4631160	4632160	We're talking about you, Tim.
4632160	4638160	The table was like, you know, sorry.
4638160	4639160	Don't worry about it.
4639160	4640160	It's me, too.
4640160	4642160	I do the same thing, believe me.
4642160	4643160	It's every show.
4643160	4646160	That's why I was shifting over to Lou Anna for a second when you got adjusted to the...
4646160	4648160	Because this gets boring really fast.
4648160	4649160	Trust them.
4650160	4655160	But I was going to say, Lou Anna, what's your, what's your, like, not your current job,
4655160	4658160	but, like, the one that you feel failed at?
4658160	4661160	Like, in other words, because you didn't take piano lessons, or what's the thing that
4661160	4665160	you would have done, that you should have done, that you...
4665160	4669160	Do you still think about, like, fuck, I didn't do that thing?
4671160	4674160	I failed at all of my jobs.
4675160	4677160	It's like, I just need money, so...
4677160	4678160	Right.
4678160	4683160	It's not like a dichotomy where it's like, my dream life and then my regular life.
4683160	4685160	I just know I need to survive.
4685160	4686160	Okay, yeah.
4686160	4690160	I guess, come to think of it, we sort of create that dichotomy in Hollywood, because we're
4690160	4694160	like, what if poor people didn't kill rich people?
4694160	4697160	I guess it would be because we showed the movies about how working in a factory was
4697160	4699160	just as good as their dreams.
4700160	4706160	And the way we do that is by fading in on someone who has a dream and a factory job.
4707160	4710160	And then we factory out these, like, myths to people.
4710160	4712160	What factory do you work at?
4712160	4714160	It's called Walmart.
4717160	4720160	What's your post there?
4720160	4722160	I work at the home office.
4722160	4725160	I answer calls about registers.
4725160	4727160	Answer calls about registries?
4727160	4730160	Answer registers if the register breaks.
4730160	4733160	Wait, are you, like, a technician that fixes the register?
4733160	4738160	No, I just take the call about it and then I send it to the person who will fix it.
4738160	4740160	Just tell somebody there's a thing broken.
4740160	4742160	I'll send it to the sex level.
4742160	4746160	Do you live in constant fear of people realizing that your job could be...
4746160	4748160	They know now.
4748160	4752160	There's a phone on the left side of your desk and a phone on the right side?
4752160	4756160	And then someone's going to notice that you can connect the cords?
4756160	4760160	I'm laughing because I'm a cruel person.
4760160	4762160	No, I'm laughing because I've been there.
4762160	4764160	I guess I don't know.
4764160	4766160	That's okay.
4766160	4767160	Well, what are we...
4767160	4768160	Yeah, okay.
4768160	4769160	All right.
4769160	4770160	Lights are out.
4770160	4772160	I found out we were playing craps on stage.
4772160	4774160	Okay, so back to you.
4774160	4775160	See, I forgot your name.
4775160	4776160	Tim.
4776160	4777160	Tim.
4777160	4780160	Easy name to forget.
4780160	4782160	Now you're a little more relaxed.
4782160	4787160	Like, pitch us your app.
4787160	4789160	No, I don't know.
4789160	4790160	I just want to...
4790160	4791160	I just brought you up.
4791160	4792160	I was like, somebody hug me.
4792160	4794160	What kind of writer are you?
4794160	4798160	Would it be screenplays or novels or short stories or...
4798160	4799160	Poetry.
4799160	4800160	Poetry, really.
4800160	4801160	Really?
4801160	4802160	Poetry.
4802160	4803160	Yeah.
4803160	4804160	Yeah, basically.
4804160	4806160	The thing is, you can be a failed poet and die, and then people find out later on that
4806160	4807160	you were a green poet.
4807160	4809160	That's what I'm counting on.
4809160	4813160	But that's what makes it the hardest job of all, because you're like, how do I know when
4813160	4814160	I've started or finished?
4814160	4815160	Exactly.
4815160	4817160	I'm like, I'm going to write some poetry today.
4817160	4824160	Well, maybe this blank page is my poem, or maybe it makes me identical to a non-poet.
4824160	4827160	And then you're like, I'll put an A.
4828160	4830160	That might be the best poem ever.
4830160	4831160	I will never know.
4831160	4832160	Yeah.
4833160	4839160	So, what I was trying to say before is you put yourself out there.
4839160	4847160	You stand up here and show people your failure, your true self, but also your accomplishments,
4847160	4848160	right?
4848160	4849160	Yeah.
4849160	4850160	And it's impressive.
4850160	4851160	That's what we love about you.
4851160	4852160	Yeah.
4852160	4853160	I take it for the team.
4853160	4855160	I'm like, look, if I can do this...
4855160	4856160	Exactly.
4856160	4857160	Oh, come on.
4857160	4858160	What are we afraid of?
4858160	4859160	What's your worst nightmare?
4859160	4865160	Ending up here, going like, that's my show.
4865160	4868160	And then you're like, here's $10, $15.
4868160	4872160	And then you're like, there he is going, I go, I can do it.
4872160	4874160	Like, I think it's a service.
4874160	4875160	I like it.
4875160	4877160	I like connecting with people.
4877160	4879160	Give him the poem up.
4879160	4881160	Are you talking to him or me?
4881160	4882160	Okay, him.
4882160	4883160	You want a poem from Tim?
4883160	4884160	Yeah.
4884160	4886160	Do you have poems that you would never...
4886160	4889160	You seem like a guy that would never want to share one of your poems.
4889160	4892160	That's a challenge.
4892160	4893160	I'm sorry, guys.
4893160	4895160	I don't have them memorized.
4895160	4898160	I'm not a spoken word poet.
4898160	4899160	Yeah, sorry.
4899160	4903160	But the thing is, poetry is an important thing.
4903160	4907160	I'm only recently getting into poetry and really reading poetry.
4907160	4913160	Poetry for me always seems like something that's a little distant and you have to be
4913160	4914160	smart or...
4914160	4917160	It's like listening to jazz.
4917160	4922160	That horn solo by Coltrane, it's above my musical brain.
4922160	4925160	And you read poetry and it kind of escapes you a bit.
4925160	4930160	But if you really sit down and listen to poetry and let it wash over you, it actually is really
4930160	4931160	important.
4931160	4934160	And also, I'm not being reductive or diminishing at all.
4934160	4937160	Luke, what you read for us, that was poetry.
4937160	4942160	It's cool for people to write things down just for the sake of writing them down and
4942160	4945160	saying them out loud or putting them on paper.
4945160	4947160	So, to be a poet is important.
4947160	4952160	I think especially now when our president can't finish a fucking sentence.
4952160	4953160	Absolutely.
4953160	4955160	Also, he's the only president.
4955160	4958160	And hey, I voted for him too.
4958160	4962160	He's just not the most literate president we've ever had.
4962160	4963160	We can all admit that.
4963160	4964160	I voted for him.
4964160	4965160	I'm kidding.
4965160	4966160	There's probably people here that voted for Trump.
4966160	4968160	Let's not make this political.
4969160	4974160	He didn't have a poet laureate at his inauguration because he's not poetic.
4974160	4977160	And I think we need poetry in the world right now more than ever.
4977160	4982160	So, to have people that...
4982160	4985160	I am suspicious of everybody who always...
4985160	4987160	Everybody who has a problem with words.
4987160	4988160	And I've always had that problem.
4988160	4992160	And believe me, I acknowledge the fact that the left side of the political spectrum has
4992160	4995160	had a problem with words more than anybody.
4995160	4997160	Whose phone was that?
4997160	4998160	Okay, good.
4998160	4999160	Just make sure.
4999160	5000160	Sorry.
5000160	5003160	I mean, I've been as much like...
5003160	5005160	You know, people have told me, you used the wrong pronoun.
5005160	5006160	You did it again.
5006160	5007160	I did it to Levi.
5007160	5008160	I did it like...
5008160	5014160	And I have the biggest foot in your mouth, kind of like old fat white guy, kind of like
5014160	5019160	face of the enemy of progression kind of syndrome going on.
5019160	5023160	And for the longest time, it was very easy for me to be like, Jesus Christ, he's fucking
5023160	5025160	politically correct Nazis and all this stuff.
5025160	5032160	And there is a part of us, the best part of us, that's like, oh, let's all just start
5032160	5034160	being really, really nice to each other.
5034160	5037160	And let's have a rule that you have to be really, really nice to each other.
5037160	5045160	And then, now, actual bad ugly hatred has come out of the woodwork.
5045160	5050160	And the really weird thing is that a lot of the people who have been the most adamant
5050160	5054160	to adapt to a world where we have rules about what we say are the people that are now
5054160	5061160	forced to acknowledge that, fuck, the only enemy of this thing is like verbal nudity
5061160	5066160	is like making mistakes, babbling, like saying what you actually mean.
5066160	5071160	If the more people do that, and also it has to be coupled with, if you're wrong, then someone
5071160	5073160	says, that offended me.
5073160	5075160	They don't mean you shouldn't have been born.
5075160	5078160	They don't mean that you shouldn't have any money that you have.
5078160	5080160	They don't mean that you should lose your job.
5080160	5085160	They mean that offended me, and you can actually just be like, okay, fine, then you're easily
5085160	5087160	offended, whatever.
5087160	5091160	But what is my fucking point?
5091160	5096160	We're all awash in this weird zone right now.
5096160	5098160	I have no idea.
5098160	5101160	You're awash in this weird zone.
5101160	5104160	We have work tomorrow.
5104160	5106160	I don't have a point.
5106160	5111160	This is usually the part of the show where I spiral into a really accidentally eloquent rant.
5111160	5115160	It's intentional and not an eloquent this time.
5115160	5117160	Just your tough luck.
5117160	5119160	You're out 15 bucks.
5119160	5125160	You would have lost a lot more out there this last two hours.
5125160	5128160	Those machines are designed to rob you.
5128160	5130160	I don't care.
5130160	5134160	I just throw everybody under the bus and get on a plane.
5134160	5136160	I don't know what I'm saying.
5136160	5139160	I'm scared and fat and white and sad and straight.
5139160	5141160	I guess I offered to 69 a guy.
5141160	5142160	Thank you.
5142160	5143160	Thank you for your applause.
5143160	5144160	Thank you.
5144160	5145160	That's very brave.
5145160	5148160	I don't know what part you're applauding.
5148160	5153160	We're having a small meet in Greek after Dan's going to 69 10 people after the show.
5153160	5156160	I will 69 everybody that hasn't been 69 yet.
5156160	5159160	Now, Tim, a friend of yours, I think, handed you a phone.
5159160	5163160	Is that somebody handing you one of your poems for us to hear?
5163160	5164160	Yes.
5164160	5165160	Really?
5165160	5170160	I mean, you know that you know that we're going to even if it sucks, we're going to
5170160	5173160	pretend it's awesome because that's how humanity works.
5173160	5176160	Can I do a small interlude real quick?
5176160	5180160	Whatever your politics are, whether you are pro-Trump, anti-Trump, whatever your stance
5180160	5185160	is right now, he didn't have a poet at his inauguration, which is normally the case.
5185160	5188160	That's what I was saying, yes.
5188160	5189160	His point.
5189160	5194160	I want to read one quote that is what John F. Kennedy said at his inauguration, or maybe
5194160	5198160	not his inauguration, but he said at some point, when power leads a man to arrogance,
5198160	5203160	when power leads a man toward arrogance, poetry reminds him of his limitations.
5203160	5210160	When power narrows the area of man's concern, poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity
5210160	5211160	of existence.
5211160	5214160	When power corrupts, poetry cleanses.
5215160	5217160	I want to include Luke in that and everybody.
5217160	5221160	And also Dan in your ramblings.
5221160	5226160	The idea of saying what's on your mind and being able to say it semi-intelligently, hopefully
5226160	5233160	very intelligently, the idea of expressing thought in a world where right now it's just
5233160	5237160	dying on the fucking vine.
5237160	5241160	We've got Tim on stage who is a poet and is worried that you're a failed writer.
5241160	5242160	You're not a failed writer.
5242160	5246160	It's fucking gorgeous that you are a poet in a world without poetry.
5251160	5252160	I know what you're thinking.
5252160	5253160	How do I follow that?
5253160	5254160	I know what you're thinking.
5257160	5263160	The answer is with sincerity and like, look, you've got nothing but runway hair.
5263160	5265160	You saw what we put up with.
5269160	5270160	You know.
5270160	5273160	Dan played fake craps with a bunch of guys who didn't know who we are.
5273160	5277160	You know how bad this show is.
5277160	5278160	You're good.
5278160	5281160	Tim, lay one on us please.
5281160	5282160	Okay, I'm just going to read it.
5282160	5285160	This is called Challenger Deep.
5285160	5288160	I'll just read it.
5288160	5295160	In truth, once more, I stood shivering, clinging to starboard gear, unnatural fear, braided
5295160	5301160	lines, strained out of roiling water, snagging sea monsters, trawlers coaxing nightmares
5301160	5303160	to light.
5303160	5308160	When ancient head near breaking Pacific lines snapped, the behemoth sank back to the deep
5308160	5312160	caverns unfathomed.
5312160	5316160	Four times over the morning course we drugged the bastard skyward.
5316160	5320160	Four stolen hooks left us ragged shrouds of algae.
5321160	5325160	Midday and the captain ordered a final angle.
5325160	5330160	I think he caught my ashen face, ordering me to take lead.
5330160	5334160	Either fear abandoned ship or the coward dog's body.
5334160	5338160	I lurched forward, clutching leaded nets.
5338160	5345160	Shouts fell away above a submarine missile's shadow, scuttling aft, nymphod under dying wake.
5346160	5350160	Tiger propping herself on deck, resting on pectoral fins.
5350160	5353160	As a child might lean elbows on a soda counter.
5353160	5359160	Powerless, I caught myself searching sunken, stalking eye, incredulous mate's tails.
5359160	5365160	Some hideous king swallowing whole to become man, to walk on land, to seduce, to spawn
5365160	5371160	amphibious, to devour mothers, to drag fathers through the void.
5371160	5375160	Anvil skull, smiling rows of arrowheads.
5377160	5379160	Yay.
5381160	5382160	Thanks.
5384160	5385160	Thanks, Nick.
5385160	5386160	You bet.
5386160	5389160	I like the size of the page.
5389160	5391160	Perfect.
5391160	5393160	A scrollable page.
5393160	5398160	Also, we can say for sure you're not a failed writer.
5398160	5400160	That's magnificent, man.
5400160	5404160	You've been given a horrible task.
5404160	5406160	You have to keep writing.
5406160	5408160	You have to keep writing for no audience.
5408160	5410160	You have to keep doing it whether you like it or not.
5410160	5413160	You're the only person that can say those words.
5413160	5414160	It doesn't matter.
5414160	5417160	I guess that's what I was trying to get at.
5417160	5424160	This thing about fashion and when we're saying the right thing and the wrong thing
5424160	5428160	and how that reflects upon whether or not we want humanity to progress,
5428160	5433160	it's like, well, we've actually fallen back to a position where, okay,
5433160	5436160	there's a war between the people that think you need to say what you feel
5436160	5440160	and the people who think that that should be actually put over here
5440160	5446160	while you do things that affect people and that you lie.
5446160	5448160	That's what politics should be and all that stuff.
5448160	5452160	No matter what you voted for, no matter what your politics are,
5452160	5456160	no matter how your family leans and what you think people forgot
5456160	5459160	and what sickens you and how you're sick of this and all that,
5459160	5462160	I'd like to think that everybody that I would want to hang out with
5462160	5467160	is somebody that agrees that it's better to just barf out shit
5467160	5472160	and some of it will be silk and some of it will be dessert from last night
5472160	5476160	and some of it will be ugly and some will be beautiful
5476160	5478160	and we've got to sort it out.
5478160	5480160	It's just our job.
5480160	5483160	Why am I explaining that to you? You're a poet.
5483160	5487160	But that's what I love about this podcast is that you guys throw it all out there
5487160	5489160	and I worry too much as a poet.
5489160	5492160	I worry too much about making it perfect.
5492160	5494160	Did you hear the open mic eagle episode where he was like,
5494160	5496160	yeah, the enemy is stopping.
5496160	5498160	It's like, oh, it's that idea.
5498160	5500160	I've said that a thousand times to young writers
5500160	5503160	but I never follow this advice ever, ever.
5503160	5505160	I've never followed what it was.
5505160	5509160	The idea that your job is to write something good is why you're not writing
5509160	5512160	because who the fuck is going to write something good?
5512160	5515160	It's your own definition of good writing.
5515160	5517160	It's going to be automatically better than anything you've ever written.
5517160	5520160	If you're worth your salt, that's not what you're going to write.
5520160	5522160	You have to write something underneath.
5522160	5524160	You have to write shit that you think is bad.
5524160	5529160	You have to get to that level and you just get it out there.
5529160	5531160	I never do it. I never do it.
5531160	5533160	I sit there and go like, fuck it.
5533160	5535160	And then someone calls and says, you're fired tomorrow.
5535160	5537160	And then I go, fuck you then.
5537160	5539160	And they're like, this is fine.
5539160	5541160	I'm like, yeah, it was fine.
5541160	5544160	Because I'm a genius.
5544160	5546160	And then I say on Twitter, I'm a genius.
5546160	5548160	And then you guys say, I'm a genius.
5548160	5551160	And then I come to Oklahoma and do a show.
5551160	5556160	People get cake, but overall, I don't know.
5556160	5558160	All right, well, thank you, Tim, for that poem.
5558160	5559160	I really appreciate it.
5559160	5560160	Thank you, Tim.
5560160	5566160	Tim, real quick, before you go, is there a way for people to find your poetry online
5566160	5567160	that we can go look at?
5567160	5570160	Or is there a last name or a thing that we want to find?
5570160	5573160	My last name is Murin, M-U-R-E-N.
5573160	5577160	You might find a couple of things out there if you really want to search for them.
5577160	5578160	Yeah, well, I do. Yeah, that's cool.
5578160	5579160	Thanks.
5579160	5580160	Thanks, Tim.
5580160	5585160	He had that pause for a second.
5585160	5589160	He was like, my last name is, and I was like, oh, here we go.
5589160	5596160	He was like, my last name is Hitler, but here's the thing.
5597160	5600160	I'm obsessed with nautical imagery, and I learned it.
5600160	5608160	Well, my grandpa told me about Hitler's conquest at sea.
5608160	5610160	But I'm not one of those Hitlers.
5610160	5612160	I'm a self-loathing Hitler.
5612160	5614160	Loana, are you an artist anyway?
5614160	5615160	Do you have any artistic leanings?
5615160	5616160	Not at all.
5616160	5617160	None?
5617160	5620160	You don't sing, you don't dance, you don't write?
5620160	5622160	I can't cut a straight line.
5622160	5624160	With the scissors you mean?
5624160	5627160	She says, she's all crafty, my whole family is.
5627160	5629160	I can't cut a straight line, I can't draw.
5629160	5632160	Are you young enough for me to ask how old you are?
5632160	5634160	I am, I forget all the time.
5634160	5635160	Twenty-eight?
5635160	5636160	Twenty-eight.
5636160	5640160	Yeah, that's a good age.
5640160	5643160	I think that's how old Steve is now.
5643160	5646160	I kind of have this, it's a horrible human urge.
5646160	5650160	I want to see you panicked.
5650160	5653160	Jesus Christ.
5653160	5657160	Well, because she's so evolved and relaxed, I'm like, what makes her panic?
5657160	5659160	I said it was a horrible urge.
5659160	5662160	This is the dynamic, it's great, they love it.
5662160	5667160	So you're admittingly not an artist in any way?
5667160	5668160	None.
5668160	5669160	None.
5669160	5672160	But you seem just cool as shit, like you're a mellow.
5672160	5675160	Maybe that's a secret, I think artists are all crazy people,
5675160	5680160	they have to say something to get off their chest so they can relax,
5680160	5683160	but you just seem naturally relaxed.
5683160	5686160	My art is not worry.
5686160	5688160	No, this is a real thing.
5688160	5689160	You're Buddha.
5689160	5692160	Your art is big.
5692160	5695160	This is a real thing I've been thinking about because I'm writing this book
5695160	5699160	that's going to also rob people of their money.
5699160	5705160	I'm thinking about human evolution and how we're all coming from chimpanzees.
5705160	5708160	I'm sorry if you didn't vote for that.
5708160	5710160	I know you're all liberal, it's fine.
5710160	5712160	And I didn't mean that if you're not.
5712160	5716160	I'll suck your dick for a dollar.
5716160	5718160	Don't beat me up.
5724160	5728160	Do you think those poker guys are still here?
5728160	5729160	Check in with them.
5729160	5731160	No, no, let's not check in with them.
5731160	5734160	But no, I love to think that they hung out and then they're like,
5734160	5735160	who's Duncan Trussell?
5735160	5738160	And then they're like...
5738160	5745160	But I was just thinking about chimpanzees and the fact that we as a species,
5745160	5751160	the species that we evolved from, our shtick became alarm.
5751160	5753160	We peaked at...
5753160	5755160	We were so satisfied.
5755160	5757160	We have no enemies.
5757160	5760160	The only thing we had to worry about was leopards coming at us
5760160	5764160	and then we just became this species that was like, we'll sit here,
5764160	5766160	we'll eat, we'll fuck, we'll hang out.
5766160	5769160	And then if anything fucks with us, we'll go, ah!
5769160	5771160	And then everyone will go run away.
5771160	5774160	And now today we just walk around with these devices in our phones
5774160	5778160	and it's just like everything that alarms us is the thing that sells.
5778160	5781160	It's bigger than just the news.
5781160	5784160	It's like our stories are about, you're going to die,
5784160	5786160	how are you going to deal with that?
5786160	5790160	We're beyond addicted to it.
5790160	5792160	We're built on it.
5792160	5798160	We are just people that we don't think that anything could possibly be fine.
5798160	5802160	And as a result, nothing is ever fine.
5802160	5806160	There's always shit to worry about which continues to feed itself.
5806160	5812160	It's like a junkie saying, well, I only do heroin when my life's going really shitty.
5813160	5816160	Guess what? That's going to be Wednesday.
5816160	5821160	It's going to keep happening because you're putting yourself on that zone.
5821160	5825160	We've been doing that but unlike with heroin or booze or anything,
5825160	5829160	there's absolutely not a single human being or even carbon-based life form
5829160	5831160	that's not on this thing.
5831160	5833160	So no one's ever going to call us on it.
5833160	5835160	But that's what we're doing.
5835160	5839160	We're sitting around figuring out how to freak out
5839160	5845160	and we're never going to stop unless we actively decide that we have a problem
5845160	5851160	and have a 12-step meeting where we're like, we love freaking out.
5851160	5854160	We don't want to do it anymore. We're always going to want to do it.
5854160	5857160	Let's go to the moon and not freak out anymore.
5857160	5860160	I don't know why I'm laying all this on you.
5860160	5862160	You're working at Walmart and you're like, fine.
5862160	5866160	I'm projecting onto you and I'm like, here's the thing, Luanna.
5867160	5870160	Luanna, you're so laid back.
5870160	5872160	You're so laid back.
5872160	5874160	Do you have anxiety at all?
5874160	5877160	I don't want to say you're laid back.
5877160	5882160	But when you lay around the house, the house goes back.
5885160	5889160	Do you ever have anxiety? Do you get hung up on shit?
5889160	5895160	Are you bullshitting us or are you just that mellow even keeled all the time?
5896160	5902160	Or is it something that you have to sublimate and eat up that anxiety when you bury it down?
5902160	5904160	You're a raging inferno inside.
5904160	5905160	Yeah.
5905160	5906160	You're about to go off.
5906160	5909160	I'm fine with being a raging inferno. I like this.
5909160	5913160	You're fine with us accusing you of being a raging inferno inside.
5913160	5916160	She's fucking with us.
5916160	5918160	She's fine with everything.
5918160	5924160	I'm asking, is it possible to be just completely laid back or are you keeping some shit buried?
5924160	5930160	I freak out, but it's not for long. I don't stay mad long. I don't do anything for long.
5930160	5931160	You don't hold grudges?
5931160	5932160	No.
5932160	5934160	That's good. That's great.
5934160	5937160	Is there anything, and I know the answer is no.
5937160	5942160	Is there anything that you repeat to yourself when you start to get upset that makes you relax?
5942160	5946160	I know the answer is no, because you're just like, oh, I'm relaxed.
5946160	5950160	I'm trying to learn things like, oh, whatever, Luanna.
5952160	5953160	I'm sorry.
5953160	5954160	I feel like I'm upset.
5954160	5964160	He's asking you to tell him that you have a mantra that keeps you cool, but you're probably just cool built in.
5964160	5967160	I want that to be true, but that's not true.
5967160	5971160	Yeah. You want to help me because that would be great, but you're fine with, you're fucking fine.
5971160	5980160	I just watch TV all the time, and I would spend weekends just listening to your commentary on community.
5980160	5982160	And nothing I say?
5982160	5987160	I'm trying to tell you in those commentary, I'm like, well, this episode could have been better.
5987160	5989160	Luanna, get upset.
5989160	5994160	No, I'm just like, I'm like, who's that man?
5994160	5998160	What do you watch? Do you watch True Crime?
5998160	6001160	Law and Order Special Victory.
6001160	6005160	So you're gobbling up a little, it's fictional crime.
6005160	6012160	Yeah. If I watch like 48 Hours or something like that, it freaks me out because I live alone and then it's like, oh, someone's going to kill me now.
6012160	6017160	Yeah. 40 Hours is always about a woman who got fucking murdered by some asshole next door.
6017160	6022160	Yeah. And it's just some random person on the street. It's not like a husband or anything.
6022160	6026160	It's like they didn't know him and they saw him and then now she's dead.
6029160	6031160	It's funny because it's true.
6032160	6037160	I snort when I laugh sometimes. Sorry.
6037160	6042160	He doesn't want to. He only snorts when he's around somebody beautiful as you.
6042160	6058160	If in your laid-backness, could you osmotically understand that I'm an uptight person that is driven by his ability to make people happy, which means people have to be unhappy, have to make them happy.
6058160	6062160	Is there anything I can do to make you happy, even if you have to lie?
6064160	6069160	Like you just say like, oh, if you pulled down your pants, I would make my day and then I pulled out my pants.
6069160	6074160	That's not a... I chose that suggestion to take it off the table.
6074160	6076160	I know you don't. You shouldn't.
6076160	6080160	I'm saying like, I'm saying like, like, like, like, like, help me.
6080160	6083160	Like you're privileged. You're relaxed.
6083160	6092160	You're asking her, Dan, you're saying that you want flawed people to be fixed by your creativity and you're asking her to be flawed so that you can make her happy.
6092160	6093160	Yes.
6093160	6095160	But she clearly is a happy person.
6095160	6096160	I know, and I don't like that.
6096160	6103160	But yeah, but she likes you otherwise. Like, she already likes you whether or not she's flawed.
6103160	6105160	I'd like her to be different.
6105160	6108160	And if she's so cool, she can do that for me.
6109160	6112160	You're trying to fix somebody who doesn't need fixing.
6112160	6114160	I'm trying to break her.
6117160	6119160	No disaster. She came pre-fixed.
6119160	6121160	It's nothing to do with her, but break her.
6123160	6124160	Keep trying.
6126160	6127160	She can't seem mad at you.
6127160	6130160	This is exactly why she doesn't watch 48 Hours, Dan.
6130160	6132160	All right. All right, fine, fine.
6132160	6133160	Well, stay up here.
6134160	6138160	I'm going to go, unless you don't want to, I'm going to go out to the audience again.
6141160	6143160	Yeah, you guys like it. You like this part.
6144160	6145160	Welcome to heaven.
6145160	6147160	All right. Table nine. What's going on?
6149160	6153160	I tried to send you a drink. They wouldn't send you a drink.
6153160	6155160	I got plenty. I got plenty.
6155160	6160160	Well, right on. You got cattle one, right on, for sure.
6161160	6162160	Table nine.
6164160	6166160	Table nine needs bread.
6168160	6171160	Table nine. Table nine totally doesn't need more alcohol.
6172160	6174160	Oh, you have a community book. What is that?
6174160	6178160	A sense of community essays on the television series and its fandom,
6178160	6181160	edited by Angie Lee. What is this?
6181160	6184160	A friend of mine is a college professor and actually has a book about your show.
6184160	6185160	Wow.
6186160	6188160	Take that, Chuck, Laurie.
6189160	6193160	I don't see a lot of books about that.
6193160	6197160	Well, thank you for bringing that and having that out in the open.
6198160	6200160	It was just to give me a boost, right?
6202160	6204160	Oh, back to this guy.
6205160	6206160	We love you.
6206160	6210160	For people that don't know our show, anyone that happened in here tonight,
6210160	6215160	like the gamblers in the back table, this is a show about Dan asking the world,
6215160	6218160	do they love him? And the answer is yes.
6223160	6224160	All right. Okay.
6225160	6227160	All right. Well, I think that easy.
6227160	6232160	I still want to get more data, but he's angry at Luana for not needing to be fixed.
6233160	6235160	I just look, I don't know what I'm doing.
6236160	6242160	I just I have an internal gauge where I'm like, if I spent $15, I'd walk away going,
6242160	6245160	oh, that's awesome. I robbed him.
6246160	6248160	Take out $200 and say one more game of craps.
6249160	6252160	All right. Let's check in with the guy that dressed like Rick.
6256160	6257160	What's your name?
6257160	6259160	I'm John. Hello.
6259160	6260160	You say you're drunk?
6260160	6261160	John.
6261160	6262160	Oh, John.
6262160	6264160	It's projection. It's called projection. I'm sorry.
6266160	6269160	You're John. Thank you for dressing like Rick.
6270160	6271160	Anytime.
6271160	6272160	Are you from Arkansas?
6272160	6273160	No, I'm from Oklahoma.
6277160	6278160	Where the dirt's red.
6280160	6281160	Where my grandpappy's from?
6282160	6283160	Yes. Yeah.
6284160	6286160	When's the last time there was a tornado here?
6287160	6288160	A couple days ago.
6289160	6290160	Like all the time.
6290160	6293160	And a bunch of people died and it's a bad taste for me to bring it up, right?
6294160	6295160	I guess. Yeah. If you're not from here.
6296160	6297160	Okay. Good.
6298160	6300160	Well, thanks for dressing like my show.
6303160	6305160	You just met Shy Rick.
6307160	6309160	This tiny Rick, there's Shy Rick.
6309160	6310160	All right. Table 46.
6310160	6311160	How are you doing?
6311160	6312160	Pretty good.
6312160	6313160	What's your name?
6313160	6314160	Connor.
6314160	6315160	Connor.
6315160	6316160	What are you...
6316160	6319160	What's your...
6321160	6322160	Oh, come on.
6322160	6324160	I mean, you can both be Connor.
6325160	6326160	That's actually...
6327160	6328160	All right. Never mind.
6328160	6329160	Sorry.
6329160	6330160	I was going to bring up a Terminator thing and say,
6330160	6332160	everyone can be Connor, guys, especially.
6335160	6337160	He says that he's you from the future.
6337160	6338160	Yeah, I am.
6338160	6339160	And that you...
6342160	6346160	No, but he says that he's here because you don't exist anymore.
6348160	6352160	And that you're dying on an atomic level.
6354160	6355160	That's what he said.
6356160	6358160	Sorry to put words in your mouth.
6359160	6361160	And then you had some insight about that.
6362160	6364160	I don't know if I should just keep giving the mic to everyone
6364160	6366160	that just has a theory about the multiple Conners, but...
6366160	6371160	I was just saying, like, if it's sort of a pantheist kind of spiritualist thing,
6371160	6374160	it could just be both interpretations of the same basic Connor.
6374160	6376160	And where are you from, sir?
6376160	6377160	Louisiana.
6377160	6378160	Louisiana.
6378160	6379160	Oh, shit.
6379160	6381160	I guarantee you fucking...
6381160	6382160	Yeah, exactly.
6382160	6383160	That's a lateral point of view.
6384160	6387160	Did you drive here from Louisiana?
6388160	6389160	Okay.
6389160	6391160	I got up here from New Orleans.
6391160	6395160	It was a bit of a drive, but I kind of broke it off through Dallas.
6395160	6398160	I drove up to Dallas and then drove from Dallas to here.
6399160	6401160	Isn't that out of the way?
6402160	6405160	It's a bit out of the way, but there's a place to sleep.
6406160	6412160	You drove from Louisiana past Oklahoma to Texas and then came back here?
6414160	6415160	No?
6415160	6417160	Am I bad at driving?
6417160	6418160	All right.
6418160	6420160	I've lost control of the show.
6421160	6422160	It's not your fault.
6422160	6423160	It's me.
6423160	6424160	I'm a bad entertainer.
6424160	6425160	All right.
6425160	6426160	What do we do?
6426160	6427160	How long have we been doing a show?
6427160	6428160	How much show have we done?
6428160	6431160	We probably have, like, eight minutes left.
6431160	6432160	Yeah, we do.
6432160	6433160	Or 14.
6434160	6437160	But probably nine.
6438160	6440160	Let's go with 14 at least.
6440160	6445160	I say, Dan, are there two handhelds that you could take in the crowd?
6445160	6446160	What do you mean?
6446160	6447160	Are there two wireless mics?
6447160	6450160	Oh, yeah, because the people I'm talking to, they don't have a mic, and then it's just
6450160	6452160	me walking around going, who are you?
6452160	6455160	And then you hear a mumble, and then I'm like, oh, that sounds crazy.
6455160	6456160	No.
6456160	6457160	I mean, there's not.
6457160	6458160	There's only one wireless.
6458160	6461160	So maybe you do a roving wrap through the crowd.
6461160	6462160	I'll just be better at...
6462160	6466160	A transient, itinerant, errant night.
6466160	6467160	Wait, sorry.
6467160	6468160	What's your suggestion?
6468160	6469160	He wants you to wrap.
6469160	6470160	A roving wrap.
6470160	6473160	Maybe you do a groovy wrap through the crowd or something.
6473160	6474160	Right, right.
6474160	6475160	But not quite yet.
6475160	6476160	Make some friends.
6477160	6478160	Snake wrapping.
6478160	6481160	Wrapping about mamas is a crutch, says this guy.
6482160	6485160	But wait, is wrapping a crutch or just about the mamas?
6485160	6489160	Mike Eagle mentioned a crutch for freestyling.
6489160	6491160	You can't fall back on your mamas.
6491160	6492160	You're right.
6492160	6493160	No, you're right.
6493160	6494160	But I'm traveling.
6494160	6496160	I thought I could go back on the crutches if I'm going out of town.
6496160	6497160	Thank you for reminding me.
6497160	6500160	You should watch a show called Max Headroom that was produced in the 80s.
6500160	6503160	You look like the kid that created Max Headroom.
6503160	6504160	His name is Bryce Lynch.
6504160	6506160	The character's name is Bryce Lynch.
6506160	6508160	He looks exactly like him.
6508160	6510160	Wrap about you?
6510160	6511160	About crutches?
6511160	6512160	Okay.
6512160	6515160	Are you setting me up because it's like your mom uses crutches and you want to punch me
6515160	6516160	and say, okay.
6516160	6517160	Well, yeah.
6517160	6519160	What if I wrapped about crutches?
6519160	6522160	Then I wouldn't need to use the mama crutch.
6522160	6523160	Dan, do you think...
6523160	6527160	We've traveled all the way here to the Oklahoma-Arkansas border
6527160	6529160	that you could do a rap that was mama-free?
6529160	6531160	Like completely...
6531160	6535160	Like you could get out of your safety zone and not fuck any mamas?
6535160	6537160	Just let me try.
6540160	6549160	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
6549160	6550160	No mama rap.
6550160	6552160	A free rap, free of mamas.
6552160	6556160	I'm not going to rap about today or tomorrow raps.
6556160	6558160	There's going to be no mama talk.
6558160	6560160	This is a rap that's free of all that.
6560160	6562160	I am named Dan Harmon.
6562160	6565160	I got up this morning and I was disarming.
6565160	6568160	I went to breakfast and had a bowl of cereal.
6568160	6572160	I didn't fuck your mama for real.
6572160	6574160	I didn't use a spoon.
6574160	6577160	And real soon I'm going to keep rapping.
6577160	6580160	And I'm not going to rap about your mama at all.
6580160	6582160	You said mama like 11 times.
6582160	6585160	My name is John Johnson.
6585160	6588160	I didn't fuck your mama though.
6588160	6589160	Just give me a second.
6589160	6590160	Dan...
6590160	6591160	You got to give me a second.
6591160	6595160	You said mama 13 times.
6595160	6600160	And you did or did not fuck a couple mamas in that.
6600160	6603160	You guys didn't order any drinks?
6603160	6606160	I don't mean to throw you under the bus.
6606160	6607160	I'm lashing out at strangers.
6607160	6610160	I want to know if you can rap without saying the word mama.
6610160	6611160	What's your name?
6611160	6612160	Marshall.
6612160	6613160	Marshall, you?
6613160	6614160	Amber.
6614160	6615160	Amber.
6615160	6616160	All right.
6616160	6617160	Yo.
6617160	6620160	You can fuck Marshall and Amber but not a mama.
6620160	6621160	Yo.
6621160	6622160	Yo.
6622160	6623160	Yo.
6623160	6625160	Marshall, fuck Amber.
6625160	6628160	All the time.
6628160	6629160	What's your name?
6629160	6630160	Brian.
6630160	6635160	Brian doesn't feel very good about that because he's sitting closer to Amber and I should
6635160	6636160	not.
6636160	6638760	You don't just go around the table.
6638760	6644040	There's a six inch distance that it clearly indicates that he's either your friend from
6644040	6651160	work or Marshall's friend from high school and that was bad form on my part.
6651160	6655840	Let's just leave table 30 to the...
6655840	6656840	You're warming up.
6656840	6657840	You're warming up here.
6657840	6658840	Okay.
6658840	6659840	All right.
6659840	6660840	Table 32.
6660840	6661840	What's going on?
6661840	6662840	It's like...
6662840	6663840	All right.
6663840	6664840	How are you guys?
6664840	6665840	What's your name?
6665840	6666840	I'm Brent.
6666840	6667840	Brent.
6667840	6668840	Katie.
6668840	6669840	Katie.
6669840	6670840	How do you know when you're done?
6670840	6671840	Okay.
6671840	6672840	Okay.
6672840	6673840	Yo.
6673840	6674840	Yo.
6674840	6675840	Yo.
6675840	6676840	Brent.
6676840	6677840	B-R-E-N-T.
6677840	6694000	I know when I'm done, I fucked your mommy.
6694000	6695000	Sorry.
6695000	6697000	I said I wouldn't do that.
6697000	6698000	We had one rule.
6698000	6699000	We had one rule.
6699000	6700000	I said I wouldn't do that.
6700000	6701000	You instantly fucked your mommy.
6701000	6702000	All right.
6702000	6706040	Saying mommy doesn't make us not think it's a mama.
6706040	6710440	I forgot everyone else's name, and I spelled his.
6710440	6711440	Get their names again.
6711440	6712440	Let's try again.
6712440	6713440	Get their names.
6713440	6714440	We have Brent, and who else?
6714440	6715440	You want to lose your name?
6715440	6716440	What's your name, man?
6716440	6717440	Lacey.
6717440	6718440	Lacey.
6718440	6721440	She runs the whole joint.
6721440	6724800	Oh, Lacey.
6724800	6725800	She's the reason we're here.
6725800	6727000	She brought us here.
6727000	6730560	She's the biggest Harman Town fan in the world.
6730560	6733800	You tell us...
6733800	6735320	I don't care.
6735320	6741000	You guys can leave if we do a three-hour show, but if I have to in order to make sure that
6741000	6744880	your reputation is secure, what do I have to do to make this a good Harman Town show?
6744880	6747840	That's a lot of pressure.
6747840	6752360	What haven't I done?
6752360	6753360	Dance like a leprechaun?
6753360	6754360	All right.
6754360	6756360	I'm putting you on the spot.
6756360	6757360	I think...
6757360	6758360	Give the people what they want.
6758360	6759800	Take your shirt off and do baby kicky dance.
6759800	6760800	Okay.
6760800	6761800	Okay.
6761800	6762800	Okay.
6762800	6764800	I only had to hear it once.
6764800	6765800	Okay.
6765800	6766800	Yeah.
6766800	6770600	I want to say give them what they want.
6770600	6772600	Give them what they don't want.
6772600	6773600	Yo.
6773600	6778520	When your shirt comes off and you show your gut, you're going to do a show.
6778520	6779520	So what?
6779520	6781520	You go to Oklahoma and give them the news?
6781520	6785360	I didn't fuck your mama because she's not abused by me.
6785360	6788280	Yeah, I'm sorry for that language.
6788280	6789280	But...
6789280	6790280	Okay.
6790280	6791280	All right.
6791280	6792280	Sorry.
6792280	6793280	I don't know.
6793280	6794280	Hey.
6794280	6795280	Maybe you don't want me to take my shirt off if I'm so...
6795280	6801680	It sounded like you didn't like my rap.
6801680	6804800	I don't know why you'd want to see my naked body.
6804800	6805800	Right.
6805800	6812600	Let's give you the freedom to fuck as many mamas as you want, but you don't have to.
6812600	6814160	Don't make the mama thing a crutch.
6814160	6815160	All right.
6815160	6816160	Okay.
6816160	6817560	I should just robe on stage, right?
6817560	6818560	I think so.
6818560	6819560	Okay.
6819560	6820560	I mean...
6820560	6821560	Sam.
6821560	6826560	I've broken several Cherokee Nation laws right now, so let's continue the rich tradition.
6826560	6827560	All right.
6827560	6828560	I don't think I can get very...
6828560	6829560	Okay.
6829560	6830560	All right.
6830560	6831560	Okay.
6831560	6832560	Yeah.
6832560	6833560	Yeah.
6833560	6834560	Yo.
6834560	6835560	Okay.
6835560	6836560	Yeah.
6836560	6837560	Also, you're allowed to leave right now before this happens.
6837560	6838560	Yeah.
6838560	6839560	Yo.
6839560	6844160	When you go downtown and you eat some soup, you're going to eat it until you poop.
6844160	6846320	It's going to be liquid because it wasn't solid.
6846320	6849840	I fucked your mama because my name's DJ Colin.
6850840	6851840	I'm a celebrity rapper.
6851840	6854320	I just rap about what I do in the crapper.
6854320	6855840	I watch Trapper, M.T.
6855840	6856840	Oh, no.
6856840	6857840	What?
6857840	6858840	Oh.
6858840	6859840	All right.
6859840	6869840	The Midwest is the place to be.
6869840	6877000	You go down to the panhandle and you take a pee, and down to Texas and it funnels down
6877000	6878800	to Mexico.
6878800	6880080	This way you don't want to go.
6880080	6881560	You got to build a wall.
6881560	6882560	I voted for it.
6882560	6885560	I fucked your mama so hard, I exploded her tit.
6885560	6886560	Sorry.
6886560	6892960	I said I fucked your mom, but I also had a pretty good rhyme there because I rhymed exploded
6892960	6897080	and voted, which was unintentional.
6897080	6900240	Fuck, man.
6900240	6911080	Just don't.
6911080	6918680	This segment is brought to you by me and these apparently.
6918680	6923240	Hey, Diddle Diddle.
6923240	6924240	Your mama's in the middle.
6924240	6925240	I rap so good.
6925240	6926240	I played the fiddle.
6926240	6927240	I don't want to fuck your mom so hard.
6927240	6928240	I go home.
6928240	6931240	I fucked your mama with the Buffalo Rome.
6931240	6938080	It's in the place where the Cherokee Nation is going to go across the same steps as this
6938080	6939080	thing to fight.
6939080	6940080	Okay.
6940080	6941080	All right.
6941080	6942080	Come on.
6942080	6943080	Just give me a second.
6943080	6944080	Fuck.
6944080	6945080	All right.
6945080	6946080	All right.
6946080	6947080	Just like it's $15.
6947080	6948080	What do you get?
6949080	6950080	They get $69 after the show.
6950080	6951080	I got to combine.
6951080	6952080	How much?
6952080	6953080	I got enough time to be naked and go out to the audience, right?
6953080	6954080	Okay.
6954080	6955080	Okay.

6982080	6983080	Yo.
6983080	6984080	Yo.
6984080	6985080	Rap is an art.
6985080	6986080	An art is rap.
6986080	6987080	I fucked your mama until she couldn't craft.
6987080	6988080	I stopped her up with my dick.
6988080	6989080	Yo.
6989080	6990080	I made your mama sick by half a million dollars.
6990080	6991080	I'm not a man.

7004080	7006800	I'm sick by having sex with her.
7006800	7009120	It's a crutch.
7009120	7010960	I'm sorry.
7010960	7014260	I can't not rap about fucking your mama.
7014260	7015260	It's hard.
7015260	7021940	I'm really self conscious because I think I might have a skidmark in my underwear.
7021940	7023440	It's a really good chance of that.
7023440	7024440	Now you're self conscious.
7024440	7025440	I just thought about that.
7025440	7026640	You're dancing in a route full of strangers in your panties.
7026640	7027640	Yeah.
7027640	7030320	That was the last thing I thought of.
7030320	7033560	Jesus Christ.
7034560	7037560	He's the guy that wants to fail.
7040560	7042560	I just want to give you your show's worth.
7042560	7044560	I just want to give you...
7046560	7047560	Thank you.
7047560	7049560	Thank you for coming to Harbin Town, everybody.
7049560	7050560	That's been our show.
7050560	7051560	Thank you, LaWanna.
7051560	7052560	No.
7052560	7053560	Don't end it.
7053560	7054560	Don't end the show.
7054560	7055560	You can't end the show.
7055560	7058560	Thank you, Tim, the poet.
7058560	7061560	Luke, the rapper who fell in his face.
7062560	7064560	Lacey for making it all happen.
7064560	7066560	Spencer Crittenden, everybody.
7069560	7071560	I'm Jeff Davis.
7071560	7076560	Your mayor, Dan Harmon, will probably keep rapping for the next 45 minutes.
7076560	7079560	So you're allowed to leave.
7085560	7087560	Dan Harmon, everybody.
7091560	7093560	Just tell him you love him.
7093560	7095560	Just say that you love him.
7095560	7098560	And he'll put his clothes back on.
7099560	7107560	He hates himself so much that he takes his underwear and makes it a thing.
7107560	7110560	He's doing a baby dance.
7110560	7112560	Just everybody come up and hug him at once.
7112560	7114560	Everybody clothes around him and hug him.
7114560	7116560	That's scary.
7116560	7120560	These eight people withheld the standing O.
7120560	7122560	Yeah, because they're closest to you.
7122560	7124560	They're my heroes.
7124560	7128560	Dan found the four people that didn't stand up.
7128560	7130560	The show is over.
7130560	7133560	You gave that guy his $20 back?
7133560	7135560	Oh, Mark, thank you for your dice.
7135560	7138560	Mark, you got your dice back?
7139560	7141560	Rap!
7142560	7143560	Good night, everybody.
7143560	7144560	Thank you so much.
7144560	7145560	All right.
7145560	7146560	Thank you.
7146560	7147560	Half music.
7147560	7151560	There will be a line somewhere where we could talk.
7151560	7153560	You could tell me I did a good job.
7153560	7155560	Yeah, let's all meet out in the casino.
7155560	7157560	We'll have a drink and we'll hang out afterwards.
7157560	7159560	I'll let you get a photo if you ask real nice.
7159560	7161560	You've earned it.
7161560	7163560	Thank you for coming to the Cherokee Casino.
7163560	7166560	Hey, Dan, can I ask you a personal question?
7166560	7167560	Yes.
7167560	7169560	Have you been working out?
7169560	7179560	I know more about your balls now than ever.
7179560	7181560	Ever.
7181560	7185560	Can we do a free spot for me undies?
7185560	7187560	Go to me undies.
7187560	7189560	Me undies have a pouch for your cock.
7189560	7191560	Promo code Harman.
7191560	7193560	Me undies rock.
7193560	7194560	They do.
7194560	7196560	The pouch makes them look like they're a thing.
7196560	7197560	Yeah.
7197560	7200560	Your balls just nestled like a little canary in there.
7200560	7203560	Yeah.
7203560	7204560	Okay.
7204560	7205560	Let's go to the bar and drink, shall we?
7205560	7206560	Yeah.
7206560	7207560	I'll see you guys.
7209560	7210560	I'll see you guys.
7210560	7211560	We'll take pictures.
7214560	7215560	Thank you so much to everybody.
7215560	7216560	You guys are amazing.
7216560	7218560	Thank you for bringing us here.
7218560	7219560	Thank you.
7219560	7221560	A big round of applause for Lacey for making this all happen.
7227560	7244560	Did you get any of that?
7244560	7247560	It's a good show.
