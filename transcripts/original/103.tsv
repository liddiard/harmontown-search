0	22880	Hello, yes. Welcome to Nerd Mode Theatre and Meltdown Comics. Harman Town is now in
22880	29520	session. I'm your guest comptroller, Kumail Nanjiani. Please welcome the Mayor of Harman
29520	41360	Town, Dan Harman! All right, thank you. It's good to see things are already under
41360	47600	comptrol. Well, it's funny because you were like, how can you fuck this up? Well, I
47600	51480	didn't. I mean, this was the first mic I was trying to use. There's no, nothing
51480	55800	attached. Yeah, we've had a couple of guest comptrollers and people want to
55800	60440	know. Yeah, you can sense that they want to do the job right as opposed to wrong
60440	63680	and stuff. And I always, I'm tickled by the notion that you could do it wrong.
63680	70640	But because this crowd, I mean, forget it. These guys, they're just
70640	74440	lovers. They don't care. Well, that could have gone on for 20 minutes. They would
74440	79120	have watched you change batteries in a flashlight. I think they had jumped off
79120	85720	board. 30 seconds in. No way. Did you guys jump off board? I shouldn't, you
85720	97360	shouldn't ask a negative question. Did you guys fail to jump off board? That's a, that's a
97360	102400	technique telemarketers use is they always ask questions where the only, the
102400	106960	answer can only possibly be yes. They'll call you up and go, do you love the lady
106960	111680	of the house or something? Like, are you, are you, do you, do you enjoy, do you enjoy
111680	116080	long distance? Like you're, you can't, you're psychologically. Do you enjoy long
116080	120620	distance? Yeah, like they'll say, they'll say things that it's just like, like the
120620	125000	answer in your brain can't be no. So you, they get you saying yes and they get you
125000	130000	saying yes a lot. Oh, that's smart. Yeah. Do you like ice cream? Hitler was a bad
130000	138260	guy, right? Yes, yes. How's your home security? I'll take it. So you were,
138260	143840	speaking of security, you were in a hot air balloon on Twitter. It wasn't just on
143840	149440	Twitter. It was on my regular life also. I was in the physical world on a hot air
149440	154760	balloon. But did you really get into a hot air balloon? Yeah, I got into a hot
154760	159640	air balloon and I realized it is exactly what it says it is. It's not
159640	166320	helium or anything. It's just a hot air balloon. Yeah. It's air and they heat it
166320	173880	and if you stop heating it, you die. Yeah, you crash. But if it, if it, if you, if, if
173880	178200	like the propane ran out, whatever they're using to make the torch go, you
178200	182240	would, you wouldn't, it wouldn't be like a plane running out of gas. Like you would
182240	186800	just, you would just float down to the ground, right? Yes. But you wouldn't be,
186800	192040	there's no steering wheel on it. So you land in the middle of a highway and that,
192040	195600	you know, then you're dead. I wonder what the statistics are on hot air balloons.
195600	201760	Like, you know, I think 50% of the people die. It's always such a peaceful, seeming
201760	205600	mode of transportation, whether they get the smile faces or it's a Garfield
205600	209600	floating over the trees. But I bet they do that to compensate. I bet, I bet it's
209600	214320	like base jumping. I bet you people lose their heads and shit. Oh yeah. 50% of
214320	218400	people die. I saw the balloon that they were inflating and it had all these like
218400	223800	little pieces of tape on it. Like I was like, what? Don't use the one that has no
223800	228240	holes in it. Yeah. They're patching up holes. I want the new hot air balloon for
228240	237120	sure. You know, you can take a little bit of nail polish though, if you put it on a, I don't know, something. What do nail polish do? It just stops the run in the
237120	254240	balloon. Something I learned from McCall's. What's McCall's? It's a magazine. Do you guys know McCall's? Some people do.
254240	258680	I'm not from here, so a lot of this is gonna be you explaining basic pop
258680	265800	cultural things. So it's Father's Day. You know what that is, right? Just from the
265800	271000	name I can surmise. Yeah. Do they have Father's Day in Pakistan? Not really. Yeah.
271000	275720	But now he gives a shit, you know, now I have to call. Yeah. He didn't know what it
275720	280760	was two years ago, but now very upset that I didn't send flowers. I sent
280760	284680	flowers to my dad, but I don't know that he got them because I texted my, the
284680	288720	number I had for my dad in my phone and I, and I was just, I was thinking about
288720	292800	something else and I, and I, I looked at the text that I sent my dad and it said
292800	300200	happy birthday. There's so many sadnesses in that sentence. The number I had for my
300200	305200	dad is maybe the saddest phrase in the English language. So then I immediately
305200	317760	followed it up with dot, dot, dot, to all fathers. Did he respond? No. Which is, but I, but I don't think it
317760	325120	was his number. I don't know. How often are you texting that number? I'm not, I don't text him a
325120	331240	lot. Like my mom, my mom has my text message, but my mom, like my mom was
331240	335960	getting eye surgery for her cataracts and she was communicating with me
335960	342160	through Twitter direct messages, which come to me as text messages because I'm
342160	346680	subscribed to the service. And then after a while, I'm like, you have my text? I
346680	351400	don't know. It's weird. You don't think your mom's on Twitter. She has an account
351400	359280	that's locked with two followers, me and my aunt, that she uses to just, I think,
359280	363120	read tweets. She doesn't, she doesn't want to be tweeting nothing or having
363120	367080	anybody tweeting at her. How many people does she follow? Does she follow people?
367080	371160	Like is she, I think she just follows me and my aunt and I think, I think me and
371160	377920	my aunt follow her and I think that's it. My mother-in-law has a Twitter account. It
377920	384880	has one tweet and so her cousin, her name's Elizabeth Long and her Twitter
384880	389000	handle is Elizabethbitchlong that she's, she's 18. It's okay.
389000	394640	Elizabethbitchlong and the only, so my mother-in-law was trying to
394640	400520	follow her, but she didn't succeed and the only tweet she has is Elizabeth
400520	405240	Bitch Long. It's the only, it's just her trying to type it in. She tried, typed it in,
405240	410240	she typed it in wrong. Elizabeth Bitch Long, not Elizabeth Bitch Long, Elizabeth
410240	416080	Bitch Long and just tweet and she's like, I give up. And it's still out there.
416080	421560	It's so confusing, like, like, like, like, already that's, that's happening to me at 41, but just in ways
421560	427560	that are very specific, but one day just normal public life is gonna be that. Like
427560	434320	everything's gonna feel profane and, and arch and, and inaccessible and
434320	440600	exhaustive, right? Because you can imagine this poor person, like, typing. So what do
440600	447280	I, I have to type the at symbol and then I have to type her name and then the
447280	454480	word bitch. This is how I'm allowed to love her with my computer. It just seems so
454480	459080	overwhelming, you know? Like, I remember my grandpa before he died, like, like, do
459080	465240	it. It was really impressively, like, like, like using his, his new Macintosh to
465240	470080	balance the Freemasons spreadsheet for his local chapter. He's like, he's got his
470080	473480	little glasses perched on his nose and his little mouse, he's like moving it
473480	477920	around and every, you can tell every, like, his, these are hands that clutched bloody
477920	483800	bayonets at Guadalcanal, you know, thrusting and removing from the enemy the
483800	489480	blood gutter spraying arterial mist into the air as he shouted to the clouds,
489480	496520	freedom! Only to come back home and just find out, wow, now they make the cars for
496520	501840	us? Yeah, with the left click and the right click do different things. So two
501840	506400	buttons on the mouse now. I just learned with the one button. I mean, that was
506400	509700	back when it was like, the idea of the mouse was ridiculous. Remember that
509700	512840	Star Trek movie where Scotty picks up the mouse and he talked into it? Hello
512840	519800	computer. Anyways, you never talk about your dad, really. You talked about your
519800	524800	parents as a set, like, you talk. They have a unified front. They have made a
524800	530560	decision and they're sticking with it. I'll talk about my dad. My dad is, was, is
530560	535480	sort of like the funny guy in the family. He would always be doing, like, jokes. He
535480	540160	does jokes about that. What's that ethnic group? The Patans? Is your dad the
540160	544360	first with a Snappy Patan joke? Yeah, that's exactly the kind of jokes he
544360	548920	would do. And he would actually do a lot of, like, fart and shit jokes and to this
548920	552220	day I don't think they're funny and I think that's my rebellion against him.
552220	558340	Can you, can you tell us just one joke that your dad really likes? He would say,
558340	563140	he would always say that if you ate bubblegum, you would shit like a
563140	572520	yo-yo. And I would be like, dad, that is not funny. And it's not funny because he
572520	580420	said it. That seems like a good segue into the realm of conspiracy theories.
580420	585260	Because you just launched a podcast on the... Oh yeah, I'm doing a podcast called
585260	592500	The X-Files Files on Feral Audio. It's gonna be about The X-Files. It's for
592500	598340	almost nobody. What do you mean gonna be? You're on your... It is, yeah. Well, episode
598340	602740	three comes out. Dan is on it. It's a really great episode. I'm talking about four.
602740	607500	It's episode four of The X-Files, episode three of the podcast. I mean... I go by
607500	612460	X-Files. I go by X-Files. Very poorly thought out. This is gonna be confusing and
612460	617860	inaccessible by design. It came out of the gate very successful. I only have
617860	621860	one experience with one podcast, which also came out of the game very
621860	630140	successful. Thank you. Do new podcasts always kind of end up like on the front
630140	634100	pages and the things because of their algorithm? Not always, but I think what
634100	638300	they do, iTunes algorithm, this is... I don't know if this is interesting. If you're
638300	646740	just tuning in to a podcast, file cast... I was gonna say the podcast cast, but that's an actual podcast.
647380	653420	It's... It like awaits... The way it waits, new subscribers more than existing
653420	657620	subscribers. So if you get like... If I get a hundred more, that means more. That
657620	660940	sends me up higher up the charts than someone who has thousands of subscribers.
660940	663840	So in the beginning, you end up higher because you're getting new
663840	667820	subscribers and new reviews and stuff more. It's like a gold rush.
667820	672420	It's like a manifest destiny. It's like they're incentivizing settlers.
672420	676260	It is exactly that because I was like, I'll just do this and I'll do it every
676260	678940	now, then who cares? And then they're like, whoa, you're really good at this. Yeah.
678940	684580	Which is what Scientology says to you. Exactly. Whoa. Or like when you draw a
684580	689660	tippy turtle for the art school thing and you send in your shittily drawn
689660	694660	turtle and you always get back. I think it goes, whoa, stop the press. Yeah.
694660	698780	Michelangelo, I think you might be good enough to give us $5,000. Talk to your
698780	704860	parents. That's a good-looking turtle. That is exactly what this was. It was
704860	709940	number one in comedy for like 10 days. And then you're like, wait, why is it 11 now?
709940	715540	Yeah, what happened? Fucking Marin. Yeah. I'll tell you, I was very happy for the few
715540	720660	days it was above Marin's podcast. I flirted with taking a screenshot and
720660	724100	sending it to him, but I knew I would regret it for the rest of my days. He's
724100	728660	got to be so sick of that. He's like a yield sign in some hillbilly
728660	734260	highway. He's just filled with buckshot. Like everyone that drives by, everyone
734260	737860	that has a new podcast is gonna like take that screenshot. I beat Marin. Yeah.
737860	742660	It's not really true. Well, not everybody who gets a new podcast gets to beat Marin.
742660	748860	Just very, you know, rare. X-Files based podcasts get to do that. Alright, so your
748860	758180	dad, I picture him in a wife beater. No. How is it? Chain smoking. We used to
758180	764220	smoke. Quit. Start it up again. Quit. It's a struggle. I picture him as Tony
764220	769140	Shalhoub. Who am I kidding? You picture him as Tony Shalhoub. Why don't I just- Quick change and
769140	774940	that's racist. No, monk, monk, baby. Super intelligent. I think your dad is a super
774940	781460	intelligent mentally ill detective. He is very intelligent. He's a psychiatrist. He's a
781460	787480	psychiatrist. He is sort of Shalhoub in the face. He's a little Shalhoub. What
787480	795200	nationality Shalhoub? Is he Lebanese? Why don't you know? Tony? His first name is Tony. I
795200	803160	think he's Italian. No, no, no, no. Shalhoub is definitely Arabic. Armenian, maybe? Is that- I don't
803160	808640	think he's Armenian. He's not Armenian? No, Shalhoub is like- Someone's on it. Someone's-
808640	815760	He's Lebanese. Lebanese? He's Lebanese? There's a couple years ago in Michigan, he came to Flint to receive from our
815760	821200	community college, Lebanese American of the Year. He won Lebanese American of the
821200	833000	Year? Who is winning it the other years? You would think Shalhoub would have a lock on that. Who's winning? He's the whole coconut. Lebanese
833000	842040	Americans for sure. He certainly is. So this guy in the front said, is Shalhoub from Michigan?
842040	855600	He came to Flint and won Lebanese American of the Year. That's just like, Flint's economy is so downtrodden that they're like, maybe we could be the
855600	865440	Lebanese capital of the world. Hey, I was trying to get Tony Shalhoub in here. They should just rename it the Tony Shalhoub
865440	877040	award. Tony Shalhoub every year. That's like, the mayor of Flint is in this meeting and he's like, he's just hearing, looking at all these charts and hearing all these terrible things and then somebody says like, at this
877040	894040	way, actually, Newsweek has now classified Flint, Michigan as a third world city and the mayor goes, wait a minute. What if we embraced that? What if we were the premier third world
894040	920720	destination in America? What could make third world world? You come here, you buy a ticket. Tony Shalhoub is there. You shake his hand. Yeah. Are you hungry? There's no food. That'll be eight dollars, please. The water is brown and AIDS is everywhere. But probably really fast Wi-Fi. Somebody said something about Wi-Fi. I was like, that's my
920720	950600	dish on an American Wi-Fi speeds. People are off board. What are you guys getting back off board? What did you guys do to celebrate? Like, he came. I'm gonna repeat some people back in here. He did a talk. He talked about being a monk and wings and
950600	980480	then there was a luncheon. Of course. I mean, you don't have to walk me through everything. This is the Lebanese of the Year Awards. I know how this goes. Of course, there's a luncheon. There's hummus. Let me guess. You were there? You were there. Everybody in Flint went. Or just you would take it's like a was it like a hot ticket item? Like, on Craigslist? Did you have to go find it?
980600	1010600	I got to go because I was a student at the Community College. You were a student at the Community College? I'm not out of CC. That's what got me there. Wait, so he came to the Community College? Community College. Wow. I want to get Tony Shalhoub on this show. I mean, he's been he's been he's a he's a good actor. Oh, he's been great forever. Yeah, we talked about this. We talked about Shalhoub. I told you about his performance in quick change because we were talking about we were talking about you having to go in for roles where people are like, oh, this guy's
1010600	1040600	kind of like the guy on Simpsons. It's always Simpsons. They want me to do the voice that a white guy did, pretending to be what I actually am, which is Pakistani. But you know, we're the same. I remember when like, like, like some some time in the vicinity of 911, when everyone was still really amped up Ben Affleck being on The Daily Show. And it was
1040600	1070600	you would think that Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden would make easy comedic targets for Ben Affleck. But he's on The Daily Show. And he kind of like, he was like, he was like, he was making some observation about like, I think I think it was something like, like, oh, they closed Disneyland, they're worried about Disneyland, like, like, like, like these guys are, you know, like, they're gonna go, Oh, what should we bump now? And he did this voice, he launched into this, like, a poo voice. And then the crowd kind of went mild.
1070600	1100600	I just thought it was really funny. It's like, we just got attacked on this guy can't land an Al Qaeda joke. They're like, yeah, they flew planes into us. But that's a bit much. All right, anyways, so what's so my dad is a very, very smart guy. He's got a tattoo. He doesn't have any tattoos that I know of. He's bald. He has no hair on his head. And
1100600	1118100	then he started shaving. He looks cool. He's a psychiatrist. I've said that. I'm realizing I don't know him very well. All the things I think about him are stuff you could find on his Facebook page. Are you scared of him?
1119000	1130680	Um, no, like he's under your bed. But just like, like, are you scared of making him upset? Like, like, if you say something in an interview, or like, are you scared?
1130700	1147980	My dad's not the scary one. My mom's the enforcer because you feel like you'll have emotional hell to pay if she if I had to guess is that my dad would not be like my mom's very, very religious. They're both very religious. Sometimes I get the sense that if they want together, my dad would not be as religious
1147980	1177620	interesting. So I think so that is interesting. But it's unfortunately a conversation we're never gonna have. All right. You mean here tonight? Or should I call him? Hey, yeah. Come on. I mean, what's the deal with Muhammad, right? Just me and you and 100 other people and then thousands tomorrow when it goes. I mean, is that a is that is it? Well, I think it's both. It's a stereotype. And it's and it's fact like that fathers and sons have these weird.
1178180	1185540	Communication. There's so much like tension. That's unspoken and unexpressed.
1186140	1188900	Um, you mean, is it like a competitive thing? I'll say that.
1188900	1207780	Oh, just like, well, what you just said, like, I would I would think that you, okay, you grew up in Pakistan, you came here, you you had to I'm treading carefully here. No, no, no, go for it. I don't want to put words in your mouth. No, no, no, go for it. You feel yourself as kind of like you've achieved this escape velocity from something that has a certain
1207780	1235820	membrane around it. You're speaking about your dad as he's a psychiatrist. He's, he's an intelligent man. You're you, you just kind of summed up there and a very important thing like, like, like, maybe your dad also would achieve that escape velocity. Like he is this genetic blueprint of you. He's like, this, this, that's how we all and you haven't talked about it with him.
1235820	1265780	Yeah, I don't know. The idea of I was earlier today, I was imagining this is what my fantasies are having like a real conversation with my parents where we share our feelings and I almost got nauseous. It was so outside my reality to be like, well, how do you really feel about this? Like if my dad ever said to me, I'm proud of you, it would, I would like really, really, it just doesn't feel like part of
1266300	1280220	reality. Like if I would be like, what would you do with my dad, Tony Shalom, because it's so outside of like, just him saying that to me made me feel embarrassed, like my face turned red, just me thinking about that.
1280220	1293420	Because but but but it's like not for him for yourself for myself. Yeah, because it's something that's so it's like, it's like all of a sudden you're in a bathtub and someone's washing your little hinder quarters, right? Like it's too intimate. It's too emotional.
1293420	1302660	But part of it, I know is that it would take so much effort for him to say that that I would feel guilty for putting him making him make that effort.
1302660	1319020	Yeah, yeah. My dad told me I think I've told the story before, like it was, it was back when we were just the only thing I had going was channel one on one pilot for acceptable TV and for VH1. And, and all that show was great before you before we knew each other.
1319020	1348900	Yes, before you. Well, they fired me for a season and the sketches were yeah, but wait, there were two seasons. No, no, no, I'm kidding. We had a party to celebrate acceptable TV being on VH1. So it was all the channel one on one kids, we all felt kind of like we did it, we did something, we built something together, we're going to have a TV show, you know, how could this ever go wrong? And a whole bar full of them. And my parents just happened to be visiting and my dad, I walked in, I got too late for them,
1348900	1376700	because they're, they're old folk, and I walked them to their car, they're going to go to the hotel and my, they're in the parking lot behind the club TG in Glendale. My dad said, said, like, I didn't even realize I've been waiting to hear it. It was like, all those people in there, you know, they're all there because of you. They really look up to you. Very proud of you. I was like, okay, all right.
1376700	1406580	Yeah, thanks, man. Have a safe drive home. I'm gonna go explode in a urinal. It's like that moment in... Not coming. I just meant I would be seeking privacy and there would probably be a urinal there. I didn't mean I'm gonna come. Although I don't know, maybe I would come. I don't know what reaction my body would have. If my dad said that to me. It's sort of like what you described in that moment in Planes, trains and automobiles, where he puts his hand in the body. He's like, it's not pill.
1406700	1436700	It's pretty good. We've made ourselves vulnerable to each other in ways that we don't know what to do with. And then when my dad came out, the next time he was in LA was happened to be the night that Chevy Chase walked off the set of the last episode of the third season. And then we went to this and he saw how upset I was because I got the text message. Chevy walked off the set. The tag is ruined, blah, blah, blah, went to the wrap party. And I did that thing that I did. That was that night. You see TMZ referred to as me ridiculing
1436700	1466700	him in front of his wife and kids who are all 50. In front of his kids. He's not Clark Griswold. His kids have television shows. His kids are senators. They can handle it. They're on Lipitor. They've got their own problems. Oh, papa, papa. What did that
1466700	1496700	strange man say to you? They were all on rascals. It's not it's not what you think when you hear it. It was very funny at the time. But I just remember my dad at that wrap party, like, like, because, you know, they'd be like, one guy came up to me, and he was like, you know, and I totally understand this. I look back on all of it. I was the I'm an asshole, whatever, blah, blah, blah. I love my show too much. And I'm a fucking petty dick. And I have opposites will
1496700	1526700	disorder, whatever, or drunken slur disorder. But at the time, I was like, fucking was like, it was like, Look, I took that negative behavior, I turned it into something positive, the wrap party, blah, blah, blah. That's like some like, one of the crew members who was very respectful, who loved Chevy in spite of everything was like, like trying to explain to me in front of my dad, who must be a huge Chevy Chase fan. My dad's a baby boomer. He grew up and all this stuff. So like, like, he's like, he's like, Yeah, but
1526700	1556700	you know, he's a personality. He's an asset and all this stuff. And my dad was just unexpectedly like saying to this guy, like, like, like, Look, you know, if you run a business, you tell me that if I run a carpet business, and your personality means you can't lift carpet, you're fucking fired. Yeah. And then you came in a urinal. And then I went and came in a urinal again. I was like, I finally got I either either either my dad got so zen and realized that that he had like, or I
1556700	1586700	got so old that like, what finally like, we're the same guy, like, saying, let's go, you know, what's about to come out of my mouth. This is interesting. I just Emily and I are we writing a movie together. And I just realized right now, the movie ends, I have this conversation with my dad, that it is the conversation of my dreams that I'm never gonna have in real life that I wrote in this movie. It's kind of I just realized that I was like, Oh, my God, it's like the secret. Oh,
1586700	1603140	fuck you. I just realized that I just wrote that conversation that so that in some way, it'll be real in my head, even if it won't be physically real, some part of my memory will confuse it and be like, Yeah, you guys had that talk.
1603140	1633120	This makes me wonder, like, if our generation has kids, like, what's how's that trickle work? It's like, you got my grandpa's who, who were at Guadalcanal. And the other one was at somewhere in the European theater, both of them running around, stabbing and shooting and risking their lives, need both of them come back home, never say a word about it, let alone write, publish a blog about it, or a recipe book, or, you know, you have that silent generation.
1633780	1661000	The greatest generation. And then the baby boomer generation, they're like, they, they're, they're like, you know, I don't know, they weren't exactly quiet, but they, they have a little more class than my generation in terms of like, talking about their feelings and stuff. And then and then I wonder, is this is this just like a, is this just a slow continuum? Like, pretty soon, you're just gonna have a baby and the baby's crying, and you're just crying with it.
1661840	1674160	And then you just both cry, and you both suck your thumb and just roll around. That's, that's how I'm gonna do it. Probably. I'd say because Aaron made that tavern in my in my in my house upstairs, you know, Carmen's,
1674160	1694640	like, I thought this is a great nursery, because you can put a crib in the middle of it and made me really realize like, you could just have bottles of vodka and bottles of milk along the wall. And we and I could just sit in there and we could both just shit our pants and cry. And talk about how we hate being told what to when to go to bed.
1694640	1724620	I mean, we talked about this, we were talking about like, am I gonna have kids or not? I was like, I don't feel I don't feel like a grown up. I feel like I'm still shitting my pants. I don't like my dad was always a grown up to me, you know, and it felt like he had the authority to raise a child. I don't have the authority to raise a child. Like, what are we gonna? What do I want to talk to this little? Like, what's the world like? I don't know. I've been saving Hyrule my whole life. I've saved it like 20 times over. That's all I know.
1724640	1754640	I don't know anything. Is everyone just faking it? Or do people know? I think some people some people don't have to fake it in some areas. Like, some people are just really good at like putting a car up on blocks and changing the oil and the tires or whatever the hell they do. And they don't even get to enjoy it that much because they're not as good at writing a sonnet. And I don't know, it all comes out in the wash. I don't know. Like, like, I'm not saying that a guy that can fix a car can't write a poem. I'm not saying that at all. I'm not saying he's
1754640	1784640	dumb just because he's handy. I'm just mean that we all have like a bingo card. You just have random shit. There's a guy out there that's like, I'm good at fixing the car and writing the sonnets. But they got it. They got to be bad at gardening or, or managing their emotions or something like that. Like, there's something that you do and I do that's like, quote unquote, manlier than an average, just one like random category. You wouldn't be able to recognize it from across a room.
1784640	1814640	There's some specific, maybe it's just the amount of bullying you'll put up with. That doesn't feel very manlier. I know, but there's taken to an extreme, you know, Martin Luther King, you know, like, like, like, like, at a certain point, you become a real man. Putting up with a lot of shit. You can change the world by putting up with it. Anyways, watch this segue. Check it out. Okay.
1814640	1844000	I'm so excited. Sometimes you think I'm not ready to be a dad. I couldn't be a dad because I'm not a grown up. Yeah, I was feeling like that when we watched the X files. Because I was on your I see where you go. And because I was watching David Duchovny. And and it's like, Fox Mulder was 29 years old and season one of X files. And I thought I was he's a grown up. Like, I'm still I'm 41. And he's just still a grown up to me.
1844800	1871680	Speaking of X files, and X files, podcasts and conspiracy theories. There's a new podcast in town, Kumail. Well done, Dan. That is also about those things. But it's not based on the fictional. It's based on the fiction that people either believe in or don't that happens in real life. It's called real life sci fi. Did I get that title? Right? Yeah.
1871840	1881760	And it's by our very old channel one on one friends are comrades. Let's have them out here to talk about their new podcast, Willie Roberts and Wade Randolph.
1888160	1889320	I could have done that better.
1889320	1907080	No, that was fucking perfect. Kinda weak, I think. I don't know why. I will see. There you go. You guys have that. You guys have a Scully Mulder relationship on the show, right? Wade's the skeptic. I never seen X files. That sucks. I'm the
1907960	1921720	Mulder. The Smolder. Yes, the Smolder. You know the names. You don't know Scully and Mulder? No. And you're doing a conspiracy theory podcast. It's it's not about your fucking bullshit.
1924160	1926560	It's about real stuff. They're clapping for me.
1927400	1932440	I don't think they are. They just want to fight. They just they want they want they want the loose change to hit the floors.
1934480	1948400	So is it just conspiracy theories or is it is it is it like also? Well, it's eventually gonna be everything that you'll run out of real life sci fi. Like, you know, Bigfoot ghosts, UFOs.
1948840	1951800	Is the focus always on whether it's real or not?
1955000	1970120	Wait, well, yeah, kind of. I mean, will he? Well, here's the thing. If you talk to anybody who is in the conspiracy theories, there's too much information. And so like in order for it to be yes or no is hard because
1970120	1999840	it's like you could just ramble on and a lot of things don't connect. So if I were to say Hollow Earth, which I've always been fascinated by. That's a good one. Like, Hollow Earth to me believes everything he reads. Will he does? Yeah. And I and I don't. I give everything I read a chance. Like, to me, Hollow Earth thing is an interdimensional thing. Not like a how do you mean? Like the if you read about the guy who said he was flying his plane and then he was over.
2000120	2003080	North Pole, and then there was a hole opening and he went through it.
2004960	2022920	It's like Saxon. Yeah, yeah, yeah. To me, that was maybe hit a interdimensional portal that was caused by some magnetic field disruption. Right? Is this is that the story? He was flying over the North Pole. And then why did he end up? He saw a hole and flew into it. Yeah.
2022920	2052600	There's one guy who did. You're right. If you're a pilot and you see a hole, don't fly into the hole. That's what I'm saying. You're a terrible pilot. How do you turn around? You know, the first rule of piloting is don't fly into the hole. Avoid holes. They can only take place in ground, which is like the number one no no in air travel. It's the natural enemy of air travel. Ground is cancer in air flight. Like this particular guy's story, he flew into the middle of the earth and then
2053080	2081960	the beings there landed his plane, and then he met them. And then the beings in Hollow Earth, because I've read that the Hollow Earth, it starts with just the idea that much like the flat earth people, it just starts with the question, how do we know the earth's not hollow? What do you got pictures of a solid earth? And then so some people,
2081960	2111920	branches off into this tree, right? Where it's like, some people think, Oh, that's where the Nazis went. Yeah. And then some people go, that's where the aliens are. And then some people are like, Nazis are aliens. Which I which I think is amazing. I it's fun. It's I think it's fun that there are people out there who in the present day are like weaving mythology out of the thing. Yeah, really happening. My thing is, I just like to talk about all that. Because normally you bring something up. It's like, Oh, that was kind of interesting. This shitty article.
2111960	2119280	I found on the internet, I want to talk to somebody about it. And then you just get laughed at. And this is like, well, I won't talk to anybody about this.
2120920	2136600	Yeah, and you want you want to have the the the yeah, the fun with it. But then other people are like, well, that's dangerous. Because it was fun to think that you could burn women at the stake in the 1500s. Like it was fun to think leeches were curing people.
2137200	2159480	Like, it's you need to be skeptical to protect people. What kind of topics do you guys talk about? Just say the topics and I'll I know for sure if they're real or not. All right. I actually have the he's gonna give you a yes or a no. I'll tell you a yes or no. Tell me. Say it. Kim trails. Kim trails. I don't know what that is. What is that? Tell us what Kim trails are.
2159800	2173720	Kim trails is like, there's now there's a bunch of different reasons for it or because conspiracy theories about it, but that there is an additive in jet fuel that is being released over over everywhere.
2173760	2176080	It's fake making us making us docile.
2176360	2180200	Yeah, well, one of them is like a mind control thing.
2180240	2181160	Okay, that's not true.
2181800	2186360	One of them is that like, that one's nice. No, Camille's right. Yeah, I got it.
2187120	2187960	What's the next one?
2187960	2196840	Like what but like one of those is like, well, they're trying to block out some of the sun to protect us from overheating, you know, like,
2196840	2199440	why would they not tell us if that's what they're doing?
2199760	2201160	Because everyone would say no.
2202120	2208120	Everyone say no, don't block out the sun to keep. Well, here's the thing. Like, I know it's not working because we can see the fucking sun.
2209120	2211560	Yeah, it's out there every day.
2211560	2218120	If you look at it, if you look at history, though, the government has done tests on people without their permission forever.
2218640	2230800	Oh, yeah, no, I mean, conspiracy, that's the cool thing about conspiracy theories is like, there's an it's an interesting line between like, like, there are some people who will tell you who talk in fantastical terms,
2231800	2242320	and I have a flexible grip on logic that that will abuse it. So the scientific mind says, well, we have to protect, we have to protect the underlings from this kind of stuff.
2242320	2252120	You have to be skeptical and use scientific method. But however, the healthy thing about paranoia is that you should never trust the government.
2252120	2257000	And it always turns out every 30 years that they were doing fucked up shit 30 years ago.
2258000	2264800	Oh, even though I do hate the word the government, because like, even when there's two words, there's 20 groups that don't work.
2264800	2272360	What an asshole. Yeah, I know. Me and Adam said it together. I immediately knew I was. Yeah, I knew I was on the wrong side of the company.
2274360	2285360	I'm sorry, Willie. Ghosts. Ghosts not real. Fake. What about those dads? Come take it easy, Adam.
2288000	2298120	Floridating the water. What do you guys think of ghosts? What's your take on it? We haven't covered it yet. I could be convinced. Maybe you could be convinced. Yeah.
2298120	2321720	Dad, what do you think? I don't think that dead people keep being people. It doesn't make sense. Yeah. And I feel like I feel like light bounces off of solid things. But if Jeff Davis was here, he could tell you like four. Yeah, he has a lot of ghost stories. And they're great.
2321720	2335560	I do. But I do. I do believe I or I should say I am willing to believe I definitely because that to me, skepticism loses its value at the point where it starts to become dogmatic, where we start to assume that the things you don't know, you know everything about.
2335560	2365080	And so it's so I do believe that it's perfectly possible that there is like that we're because we're evolved from apes that are only biological purposes to recognize a good banana from a bad one. And we've graduated into this world where we're starting to understand things. It's totally possible that there's a lot more ways to perceive things than we actually bring up a good point, though, because there's no ape ghosts. Nobody ever.
2365560	2388520	That was my. There was an X-Files about animal ghosts. Yeah. I watch this show. Great episode. Like you don't find like you think that there'd be like Native American ghosts in the in the free country or in the open. But they never Native Americans. I don't want to be racist, but they never die with unfinished business. They use the whole life.
2388520	2417120	I can explain that. They're famous for it. It's not racism if it's a good stereotype. No, it's good. It's totally good. I just ripped that. Isn't that awesome? No, I'm a really good racist. I'm really like a genius. Yeah, it's really good. It felt like you'd written that at home. It was real good racism. It was really good. It was a good quick defense.
2417120	2446280	Yeah, go ahead. No, I just connect dots with races and stereotypes. No, I could take credit for it all night. Let's go on. So but for you, Dan, for you to be open to the idea of ghosts, doesn't that don't you have to change pretty fundamental things about how you see? Well, no, because I don't automatically assume that when we talk about ghosts, what I what I think of when I think about ghosts is I think about when you're in your apartment brushing your teeth and you turn and go fuck. It's like fucking dude with a 10 speed bike over his shoulder.
2447280	2477100	Walking through my living room. That's a fuck of a ghost. Like, like, like, like, like, like, that could be explained by a lot of things that don't have to do with there being a heaven or, you know, people dying and their skin falling away. And then I'm just like, I love 10 speeds. And I'm gonna go spread the word because I gotta solve my murder. It doesn't. It could be like, like a psychic smudge. It could be that that person like residual energy or something that every that that person fell in love with.
2477100	2503020	A woman. And every every morning when he hoisted his 10 speed over his shoulder, he had to go to work in that apartment, his heart became filled with this emotional energy that over time, the way the way a key on your keyboard can become melted at a, you know, if you're if you work in a data entry lab, like the home row is melted from friction of hitting the same button over the same time.
2503020	2505500	And it's just brought out by you brushing your teeth.
2506340	2531720	Like, no, no, it's just it's it's another it's it's human perception. It's I don't know. It's like, like, like, this is this is assuming that there's some fields that we haven't discovered yet of that we can perceive one of them is light bouncing into our retina. And then maybe some of it because is is like somehow this would get into psychic energy that this guy had this experience he would he would eat a nut bar and he'd throw his, throw his bike over his shoulder.
2531720	2550280	And it was like somehow for him, it was like a big deal. It was like, it was he did it over and over again, or he did it one day. And it was like he achieved self actualization at that moment, or he was really angry or whatever. But there's like some weird, like, like fingerprint on the film.
2550840	2561440	And then you turn as you're brushing your teeth and you see that guy's feelings, you see his self image, he left it there in your apartment, you go, yeah, some kind of like residual
2561440	2579360	energy echo that we'll just never know about. Or, I don't know. I mean, like, I'm open to most things, but I but I don't think I would ever like wake up and there'd be a guy sitting on my bed going like, like, hey, yeah, listen, I'm Napoleon. I buried my hat at McDonald's.
2579440	2586360	Yeah. When he goes like, I have unfinished business. Wait, do we have to take over Russia now? All these cabinets should be open.
2587360	2593280	You just got to find my hat. It's under the McDonald's. Go find it. You could make a lot of money on that.
2593280	2616160	But you know, when you get into I just started I like, like, like, time, okay, time, fellas. It's symmetrical. Like, we're experiencing it one moment after another. But there's all this I mean, yeah, I need I need a couple more degrees and a few more IQ points before I could really understand this or explain it. But I smart people will tell you that
2616160	2646120	time, time unfolds in all directions. Well, anything you can describe that happens in time, like, well, first of all, time is a variable and blah, blah, blah. So when your cabinet doors are open, they've all come open overnight. Yeah, maybe, maybe some lady that lived in your apartment, like, opened them in 1938. And, and, and, and, like, somehow, like, you know, time got shuffled or, but but yeah, I just don't, I just don't believe in, like, helpful ghosts.
2646800	2668720	Like helping you, like talking to you going like, Hey, I'm dead. And you're like, you're dead. Get out of here. And he's like, I'm sorry, I'm so dead. For some reason, I draw the line at like, just dialogue. Yeah, it starts to get corny. No, that's a huge leap from just like a smudge on the film to like, unfinished business. That's a big leap. I get it. I agree.
2668720	2698520	Well, like, to me, unfinished business is so it can be so like, the unfinished business you have right now, and you're all alive is like, can be so romantic comedy that we're writing stupid business. I just remembered something really funny. I was so good. I did this media conference in beautiful in the beautiful Rocky Mountains of Canada, where there was it was staying in this hotel that was absolutely shining, like, like all the good parts of the shining, like all the beautiful parts.
2698520	2711320	None of the dead scat man cruthers. And, and I kept saying, Oh, yeah, this place is a, this place is definitely haunted. If any place is haunted, is that that's the air coming out of the show? Okay, I think it's a smudge on the film.
2712320	2715640	Who used to dry her hair here 30 years ago, the
2715640	2743440	day and I was out on a patio at a party with Aaron and like, Oh, yeah, that place is probably haunted. And this guy was like, Oh, yeah, have you have you seen Toby or like, like, some guy's name or like, who's Toby is like, Oh, the bellman. Yeah. Yeah, he, oh, do you definitely people see him there at the hotel? Like, oh, yeah, what is what is what does he do? Like, oh, you know, he's the bellman. He just, he'll take your luggage and
2746640	2754240	have you ever lost a back? Because that's Toby. He's taking your bags, ghost, his unfinished business is just his job.
2755440	2765400	Yes, he's never experienced love. Geez, you know what, I forgot to thank Mr. Henderson in 314. I should really tell him a good job. Like,
2765600	2773600	very sad. That's very sad. I love the idea of a ghost who just is like, Oh, God, I still have to do the terrible job I had.
2777000	2786200	I'm sure the guy walked away like he's fucking American assholes. But like, I was like, does he say? How does he pronounce? My big question is how does how does a Canadian ghost pronounce boo?
2787200	2800200	All right, what are you doing? There are a couple false starts on that Joker. All right, so boo don't belong here. That's that's good. That's something.
2802200	2815200	But I was in the first episode of your podcast, and we talked about UFOs. Yeah, we, whether they're real or not, we're focusing more on the moon landing being faked. Oh, yeah, the moon landing being fake, right? Because the moon
2816200	2831200	according to you is a metal base. A metal? Well, when things hit it, it sounds like a bell. And none of the craters are deeper than the others. Or something when things hit it, it sounds like a bell.
2831200	2838200	They, they, they blew up, they put a bomb on the moon. And they said some people claim that it rang like a bell.
2839200	2856200	When did they put a bomb on the moon? I didn't get a vote for this. Yeah, there's so much to buy into this story. Like here's the thing. So many barriers. I don't care what you believe about the moon. It's weird that we bomb the moon. And like, most people don't know about it. Yeah. Wait, what? When did we?
2857200	2871200	Yeah, we were looking for water. Yeah, but we didn't tell anybody we were looking for water. They're going to send this bomb out to the moon. But was it a nuke? Was it a nuke? Or was it just a regular bomb? It was just like a bundle of TNT with an alarm clock on it.
2872200	2895200	With a NASA logo. There's that whole thing about us being warned off the moon conspiracy theorists love that the idea that we haven't actually, you know, done a moon mission since forever. And the idea is that we, we got there and then an alien said, get out of here. Yeah, you get out of my moon. You damn kids.
2895200	2913200	Yeah, yours is bigger than ours. We have this one. We got the moon. You got the big one. But what are the conspiracy theories about the moon? You said that the other side of the moon, the dark side of the moon has like a base on it. Well, I mean, here's the thing.
2914200	2933200	But like, okay, I'm just I'll give them this real quick. I like, I've been looking for UFOs my whole life, and I've never seen them. And then one year I saw like 30 all at once. And I called someone from across town, they saw like a fleet of them. Yeah.
2933200	2961200	I like that there's more to the story that has nothing to do with you having seen 30 UFOs. How did you see 30 UFOs? Explain that part. I mean, I mean, I, you know, I like to look at the sky. I'm fascinated by planes. They're just they're just silver things in the sky. Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying they're aliens. I but I'm just saying they're unidentified objects 30. And they look like stars in the middle of the day.
2961200	2991200	It's like, they're hard to focus on. You look at the blue sky, and you got like, I boogers and weird like ice snakes, and you can't focus. You don't know what your focal length is. And then so like, I'll see one, I'll look away, and I'll be hard to find. But I'll always be with people. I'm like, Hey, look at that. What do you think it is? And we'll look at it for like a half hour. And it doesn't do anything that I recognize, you know, and I saw 31 day. And this is the first time I saw it. I thought an alien invasion was happening. I was like, Oh, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it
2991200	2997040	I took pictures, I took video, I was drawing like, some of them were moving, some of them weren't. There were red ones and green ones.
2997040	3003320	And then I watched the skies for us today. They had changed the flight patterns for Burbank and LAX.
3003320	3008860	But that's just bullshit. You don't know that you should look up online the flight patterns.
3008860	3012480	No, no, I look at the flight patterns all the time. Like when the wind changes, you can see where they are.
3012480	3015080	You just watch the skies and you go, Oh, there's no planes.
3015080	3017380	But you can see where they were they redirected to.
3017380	3021880	Wait, there was one day of your life where you thought an alien invasion was imminent.
3021880	3022380	Yeah.
3022380	3024380	Didn't we already know each other then?
3024380	3024880	Yeah.
3024880	3026380	Why didn't you fucking text me?
3026380	3028380	Well, here's the thing.
3030380	3035380	If you think an alien inva- I want to be on the list of people and like, hey shit's going down, Kamel, get in the ground.
3035380	3038380	I was sitting there going like, is this, is this hu-
3039380	3042380	Just fucking text me, dude. I'll be the one to judge.
3042380	3045380	You're gonna get a text, you're gonna get a text every other day.
3045380	3048380	You're gonna get a lot of texts. This guy sees 30 a day.
3049380	3050380	Okay, here's the thing. I-
3050380	3053380	It's gonna be like a mad newsletter you can't unsubscribe from.
3053380	3060380	I drew out a map of the ones that were stationary and the ones that were moving and like, to me it was like, oh, this looks like a consolation.
3060380	3061380	But other people see him too?
3061380	3066380	Oh, yeah, yeah. I've been with at least 30 people and I've been like, what's that?
3066380	3067380	Is 30 just a number?
3067380	3068380	It's only 30.
3068380	3070380	Is that the highest you can count?
3070380	3074380	I can say 10 names right now off the top of my head.
3074380	3075380	Obama.
3075380	3078380	You were with, yeah, Obama, Margaret Thatcher.
3078380	3082380	Shane, Jen. I mean, I've been with like groups of people.
3082380	3083380	And people have seen these things.
3083380	3084380	Yeah.
3084380	3085380	These Armada.
3085380	3089380	I mean, I've seen them, but not in Armada. I've seen like one or two.
3089380	3092380	And they're just silver things.
3092380	3093380	But here's my thing.
3093380	3098380	Okay, I saw these things and then I started telling people because I'm like, to me it was like, this is kind of fucking weird.
3098380	3099380	I should tell everyone I know.
3099380	3100380	Didn't tell me.
3100380	3101380	And I even-
3101380	3103380	I guess I'm not one of the people I know.
3103380	3105380	I even told Wade at the first party I went to.
3105380	3110380	I don't know if you remember, but like you just kind of laughed it off and like nobody was listening to me.
3110380	3115380	And I was like, this is weird because I saw something that to me, I'm not saying they're aliens.
3115380	3119380	I'm just saying this was life changing to me because there were things in the sky that I didn't know what they were.
3119380	3124380	And it made me think, and everyone was basically laughing or not believing it.
3124380	3130380	And it made me go like, everybody that has a weird story that people laugh at, like, I want to listen to their story a little more.
3131380	3138380	Every movie, every sci-fi movie, your character is the good guy, but in life you're the crazy guy.
3139380	3142380	Your only recourse is the right sci-fi movies.
3142380	3147380	Do you guys have people on the show that are like experts, like ufologists?
3147380	3149380	Not yet. I want to get there though.
3150380	3151380	They had me on.
3152380	3154380	You believe in the UFO? I was like, it's possible.
3154380	3156380	And he's seen all the X-Files.
3157380	3164380	Well, I would talk to you guys all night, but my sluggishness means we get a train schedule to keep.
3164380	3167380	It's real life sci-fi. It's on Feral Audio.
3167380	3169380	I think it launches Monday.
3169380	3174380	It's going to be on Feral Audio on Monday, which is today, I guess, for all intents and purposes.
3174380	3177380	Yeah, it'll be today when most people hear about it.
3177380	3182380	This is a crazy audience, by the way, because they're willing to not watch the Game of Thrones finale.
3183380	3185380	Most of them watch it on the East Coast feed.
3185380	3187380	Oh, you've already seen it? Okay, don't tell me.
3187380	3188380	How was it?
3188380	3189380	Good, real good.
3191380	3192380	No, they're very...
3194380	3198380	We have a relationship here. These guys are good people.
3198380	3202380	I understand the NBA Finals. You guys can miss that.
3203380	3205380	But Game of Thrones, shit.
3205380	3209380	All right, well, thank you Wade Randolph, Willie Roberts for coming by.
3209380	3210380	Thanks for having us.
3211380	3213380	Real life sci-fi.
3215380	3216380	Just put it down.
3218380	3222380	All right, so we've got to keep the train speeding, speeding along.
3222380	3226380	I've fucked up real bad. I've made our show real long.
3226380	3228380	Is it going too long?
3228380	3231380	No, I just mean, there's so much to do.
3231380	3232380	Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's so much to do.
3232380	3233380	There's one other thing to do.
3233380	3234380	Let's go on to the next segment.
3235380	3238380	Eric McGathey, will you come out, please?
3242380	3244380	This is my fiancé.
3244380	3246380	Hi, everybody. Hi.
3248380	3250380	So I'm here for a special reason.
3250380	3251380	Yes.
3252380	3255380	The Harman Town documentary is premiering tomorrow night.
3255380	3264380	And we actually have two tickets to the Harman Town documentary,
3264380	3268380	and Dan was like, how should we give these away?
3268380	3271380	And I begged to do a McGathey game corner.
3273380	3274380	And he said no.
3276380	3277380	No, no, he said yes.
3277380	3284380	So is there anybody here who does not have tickets tomorrow and really wants to go?
3285380	3287380	All right, we've got two hands here. Come on up.
3287380	3288380	Sorry, what's your name?
3288380	3289380	Daniel.
3289380	3290380	Daniel?
3290380	3291380	Great. And then hands like that.
3291380	3292380	We should do a lady one.
3292380	3294380	We should do a lady one, right?
3297380	3299380	Someone who would actually go.
3301380	3303380	I'm sorry, you have a very sweet face.
3303380	3305380	Here, come on.
3305380	3306380	All right, hello.
3306380	3307380	I already forgot your name.
3307380	3308380	What was your name again?
3308380	3309380	Daniel.
3309380	3310380	What was your name?
3310380	3311380	Bethany.
3311380	3312380	Bethany, fantastic.
3312380	3313380	And Kumiel, I'm going to...
3313380	3314380	Are those microphones?
3314380	3315380	They do.
3315380	3316380	Because I have an extra one here.
3316380	3317380	They do.
3317380	3318380	Let's make sure.
3318380	3319380	Is there another one?
3319380	3320380	Perfect.
3320380	3321380	I can sit.
3321380	3322380	Do they need another one?
3322380	3323380	Because I can sit on it.
3323380	3324380	Okay.
3324380	3325380	No, we're good.
3325380	3326380	We're all set.
3326380	3328380	And I'll explain the game in a second, but Kumiel, I'm going to have you keep score.
3328380	3329380	Great.
3329380	3332380	And I'm going to give you both these cards that say Kumiel's name.
3332380	3333380	What are the names?
3333380	3335380	Bethany and what now?
3335380	3336380	Dan.
3336380	3337380	Dan.
3337380	3338380	Dan.
3338380	3339380	How's that spelled?
3339380	3342380	All right, Bethany and Dan.
3342380	3343380	B-A-N.
3343380	3344380	Thank you.
3344380	3345380	All right.
3345380	3346380	I haven't discussed this game with anybody else.
3346380	3347380	It's only just been in my head.
3347380	3348380	So we'll see.
3348380	3349380	Should I be looking at any of this?
3349380	3350380	Or should I?
3350380	3351380	You can.
3351380	3352380	All right.
3352380	3362380	So we are going to play a game called Harmonized Impressions.
3363380	3364380	That's a theme song.
3364380	3365380	Harmonized impressions, everybody.
3365380	3366380	Welcome.
3366380	3369380	Welcome to Harmonized Impressions.
3369380	3382380	No, there are a lot of things that I have to say about these cards.
3382380	3383380	That's a theme song.
3383380	3384380	Harmonized Impressions, everybody.
3384380	3385380	Welcome.
3385380	3386380	Harmonized Impressions.
3386380	3389380	Welcome to Harmonized Impressions.
3389380	3393380	Now, there are a lot of things that I love.
3393380	3394380	I love ice cream.
3394380	3398380	I love communicating with nature, but one of the theme songs is still going up again
3398380	3399380	behind me.
3399380	3403380	But one of the things I love more than anything are Dan Harmon's Impressions.
3404380	3414380	What we're going to do is Dan has a book of Bartlett's quotes in front of him.
3414380	3418380	And there are different categories.
3418380	3419380	We're going to go back and forth.
3419380	3423380	And I'm going to give you, Bethany and Dan, I'm going to give you the choice of two different
3423380	3424380	categories.
3424380	3427380	When it's your turn, you get to pick the category.
3427380	3434380	Dan is going to read a quote from Bartlett's quote book in the impression that I've already
3434380	3436380	listed for him on a piece of paper.
3436380	3442380	And then you will have a choice of three different names to choose who he is doing an impression
3442380	3445380	of.
3445380	3447380	Yeah.
3447380	3456380	And to decide who goes first, we're going to have you both do your best Dan impression.
3456380	3459380	And I'm just going to decide really quick.
3459380	3461380	All right, Bethany.
3461380	3462380	Here we go.
3462380	3463380	All right.
3463380	3465380	I'm pretty.
3465380	3467380	I mean.
3467380	3468380	Excellent.
3468380	3469380	Dan.
3469380	3470380	I fuck your mama.
3470380	3471380	All right.
3471380	3472380	I'm going to have to go with Bethany.
3472380	3473380	Bethany, you're good.
3473380	3478380	All right, Bethany.
3478380	3482380	Oh, and you're holding cards that say Kumeil.
3483380	3488380	During the game, if Dan does his impression and you are totally stumped, you can use your
3488380	3489380	Kumeil card.
3489380	3491380	You can only use it once.
3491380	3494380	And then Kumeil will do the same impression.
3494380	3495380	Okay.
3495380	3497380	So I'll read it.
3497380	3502380	You'll get the quote and everything and you will do your best impression.
3502380	3503380	I'm terrible at impressions.
3503380	3508380	They all sound like a Pakistani guy pretending to be something else.
3508380	3509380	So we ring in.
3509380	3510380	You don't ring in.
3510380	3511380	So you're going to go first.
3511380	3512380	So this is your turn.
3512380	3514380	Bethany, go for it.
3514380	3515380	Yeah.
3515380	3520380	And your two categories that you get to choose from are captain's log or I'm a bitch.
3520380	3523380	I'm a lover.
3523380	3524380	I'm a bitch.
3524380	3526380	I'm going to go with I'm a bitch.
3526380	3527380	I'm a lover.
3527380	3528380	Excellent.
3528380	3532380	So these are three women who are known for performing at Lilith Fair.
3532380	3533380	All right.
3533380	3535380	I get it.
3535380	3537380	So and I just read a quote.
3537380	3538380	Yeah.
3538380	3539380	Read any quote.
3539380	3540380	You see the name in front of you.
3540380	3543380	And I wait for me to give you the multiple choice after he reads it.
3543380	3544380	Okay.
3544380	3545380	Multiple choice.
3545380	3546380	Here we go.
3546380	3547380	I'm a bitch.
3547380	3548380	I'm a lover.
3548380	3554380	All this will not be finished in the first 100 days.
3554380	3559380	Nor will it be finished on the first 1,000 days.
3559380	3560380	I know who it is.
3560380	3566380	Nor in the life of this administration.
3566380	3569380	Nor even perhaps.
3569380	3573380	Nor in our lifetime on this planet.
3573380	3575380	But let us begin.
3575380	3576380	All right.
3576380	3577380	Great.
3577380	3578380	So is that.
3578380	3579380	Yes.
3579380	3580380	Okay.
3580380	3581380	Is that.
3581380	3583380	Is dance doing an impression of a train.
3583380	3584380	Yes.
3584380	3585380	B Lisa Loeb.
3585380	3587380	C Sarah McLaughlin.
3587380	3591380	Can I get the choices again?
3591380	3593380	A train.
3593380	3595380	B Lisa Loeb.
3595380	3597380	C Sarah McLaughlin.
3597380	3599380	Audience answers.
3599380	3601380	Showing A. I'm gonna go with A.
3601380	3604380	That is correct.
3604380	3607380	Hey.
3607380	3608380	Yeah.
3608380	3609380	That was pretty fucking great.
3609380	3610380	Thanks.
3610380	3612380	So Bethany has one point.
3612380	3613380	Bethany is one point.
3613380	3614380	Now it's Dan's turn.
3614380	3617380	And I forgot to mention that if you get it wrong, you'll get the chicken.
3617380	3620380	All right.
3620380	3621380	Here we go.
3621380	3622380	Dan.
3622380	3624380	You can choose from these categories.
3624380	3625380	Captain's log.
3625380	3627380	Or bloody funny.
3627380	3629380	Let's go with captain's log.
3629380	3630380	Captain's log.
3630380	3631380	All right.
3631380	3633380	These are three characters from Star Trek.
3633380	3636380	First generation.
3636380	3640380	Genius is 1% inspiration.
3640380	3645380	And 99% perspiration.
3645380	3646380	All right.
3646380	3647380	Is that.
3647380	3648380	A check off.
3648380	3649380	B Sulu.
3649380	3651380	C Spock.
3651380	3652380	C.
3652380	3653380	C Spock.
3653380	3657380	No.
3657380	3658380	It's Sulu, right?
3658380	3659380	It is Sulu.
3659380	3660380	He got the chicken.
3660380	3661380	He got the chicken.
3661380	3664380	I just wanted the chicken side.
3664380	3665380	All right, Bethany.
3665380	3670380	You can choose from bloody funny or vogue.
3670380	3671380	I'm gonna do bloody funny.
3671380	3672380	Bloody funny.
3672380	3673380	All right.
3673380	3674380	These are well known.
3674380	3677380	This is a well known British comedian.
3677380	3678380	I don't even.
3678380	3690380	Men do not care how nobly they live.
3690380	3692380	But only how long.
3692380	3695380	Although it is within the reach of every man.
3695380	3696380	Obly.
3696380	3699380	But within no man's power to live long.
3699380	3701380	All right.
3701380	3703380	All right.
3703380	3704380	So is that.
3704380	3706380	A Ricky Gervais.
3706380	3708380	B Russell Brand.
3708380	3710380	C Eddie Izzard.
3710380	3717380	It's either A or C.
3717380	3720380	I'm going to go with C.
3720380	3721380	No.
3721380	3722380	Can I guess?
3722380	3723380	Yeah.
3723380	3724380	B.
3724380	3725380	Yeah.
3725380	3726380	It's Russell Brand.
3726380	3731380	A lot of this is chance because you're picking between the two.
3731380	3732380	All right, Dan.
3732380	3736380	I'm scanning down this list of people now.
3736380	3739380	All right, Dan.
3739380	3742380	Vogue or Rocket Man.
3742380	3743380	Rocket Man.
3743380	3744380	Rocket Man.
3744380	3745380	All right.
3745380	3749380	This is the host of a science related show.
3749380	3751380	Jesus.
3751380	3754380	Walk not on the earth exultantly.
3754380	3756380	For thou canst not cleave the earth.
3756380	3759380	Neither shalt thou reach to the mountains in height.
3759380	3760380	Great.
3760380	3761380	So is that.
3761380	3763380	I didn't mean to sound so dry.
3763380	3764380	Is that.
3764380	3765380	A Adam Savage.
3765380	3767380	B Bill Nye.
3767380	3772380	Or C Neil deGrasse Tyson.
3772380	3774380	Oh.
3774380	3777380	Dan has just pulled his Camille card.
3777380	3779380	He has just pulled his Camille card.
3779380	3781380	I'm terrible at impressions.
3781380	3782380	Thank you.
3782380	3786380	So Camille is going to read this exact same quote.
3786380	3788380	It's the one from the Quran.
3788380	3797380	Walk not on earth.
3797380	3802380	So no excuses.
3802380	3803380	Here we go.
3803380	3810380	I honestly don't know what this person sounds like.
3810380	3814380	I'm just going to do an impression of Dan.
3814380	3820380	I'm doing an impression of this person.
3820380	3824380	Fuck.
3824380	3834380	Weirdly this is going to be the first ever recording of me reading anything from the Quran.
3834380	3837380	Who could have predicted this.
3837380	3844380	Walk not on the earth exultantly for thou canst not cleave the earth.
3844380	3850380	Neither shalt thou reach to the mountains in height.
3850380	3852380	That's me doing an impression.
3852380	3854380	Definitely not of the other people.
3854380	3856380	Just so they know who it isn't.
3856380	3857380	All right.
3857380	3858380	What do you think Dan.
3858380	3859380	Let's go Neil deGrasse Tyson.
3859380	3861380	That is correct.
3861380	3864380	Well done.
3864380	3866380	Nice.
3866380	3868380	All right.
3868380	3872380	Vogue or drink the Kool-Aid.
3872380	3877380	So your category is Vogue or drink the Kool-Aid.
3877380	3878380	Vogue.
3878380	3879380	All right.
3879380	3883380	These are famous supermodels.
3883380	3886380	So Dan is going to do an impression of a supermodel.
3886380	3889380	A specific one.
3889380	3893380	I don't know what this sounds like either.
3893380	3898380	One of the things which distinguishes ours from all earlier generations is this.
3898380	3901380	That we have seen our atoms.
3901380	3904380	I've never heard this person talk.
3904380	3905380	That's right.
3905380	3906380	You know some of the categories.
3906380	3907380	Can I see that?
3907380	3908380	Yeah.
3908380	3909380	Yeah.
3909380	3911380	So is that A, Cindy Crawford.
3911380	3912380	B, Brooke Shields.
3912380	3915380	Or C, Amon.
3915380	3918380	I see.
3918380	3922380	Um.
3922380	3925380	Let's go with A.
3925380	3928380	That is correct.
3928380	3931380	She could hear my mole.
3931380	3934380	A lot of people in the audience are yelling out C.
3934380	3935380	So maybe you do a good amount.
3935380	3937380	Do you guys never see House of Style?
3937380	3938380	She talked.
3938380	3940380	Do you guys know House of Style?
3940380	3942380	She talked on that all the time.
3942380	3944380	I never watched no House of Style.
3944380	3946380	Camille wants a score.
3946380	3948380	Bethany two, Dan zero.
3948380	3949380	But Bethany did go.
3949380	3950380	I mean Dan one.
3950380	3952380	But Bethany did go first.
3952380	3953380	Right.
3953380	3954380	Exactly.
3954380	3955380	Yeah.
3955380	3956380	All right.
3956380	3961380	Dan, drink the Kool-Aid or free entertainment.
3961380	3962380	Free entertainment.
3962380	3963380	All right.
3963380	3970380	These are, this is a podcast host.
3970380	3975380	One of the things which distinguishes ours from all earlier generations is this.
3975380	3978380	That we have seen our atoms.
3978380	3980380	Is that A, Paula Tompkins.
3980380	3982380	B, Mark Marin.
3982380	3985380	C, Ira Glass.
3985380	3988380	Can I see the list?
3988380	3990380	I wanted to say A.
3990380	3991380	I'll go with A.
3991380	3994380	That is correct.
3994380	3999380	Although I would love to see Dan's Ira Glass.
3999380	4000380	Do it.
4000380	4001380	Do it.
4001380	4006380	We're back with public radio.
4007380	4014380	One of the things I found most interesting since you left us is the story about Jacob.
4014380	4015380	Now Jacob.
4015380	4016380	Who lost his leg.
4016380	4017380	Yeah.
4017380	4024380	Now Jacob in a cup of water.
4024380	4027380	What does that do to a person?
4027380	4028380	How many legs do you need?
4028380	4034380	We'll be right back.
4034380	4035380	So that was Dan.
4035380	4036380	That was Dan.
4036380	4037380	You guessed that right.
4037380	4038380	That was Dan.
4038380	4039380	So it's tied.
4039380	4040380	Two, two.
4040380	4041380	All right.
4041380	4042380	Bethany.
4042380	4047380	Drink the Kool-Aid or Wicked Pocking.
4047380	4049380	I'll go Wicked Pocking.
4049380	4050380	All right.
4050380	4057380	This is an actor from Boston.
4057380	4062380	There is only one proof method of assisting the advancement of pure science.
4062380	4068380	That of picking men of genius, backing them heavily, and leaving them to direct themselves.
4068380	4071380	All right.
4071380	4074380	Was that A, Ben Affleck.
4074380	4076380	B, Donald Loeg.
4076380	4079380	C, Mark Wahlberg.
4079380	4083380	I might want to do that.
4083380	4085380	How many rounds are left?
4085380	4088380	Just three, four.
4088380	4089380	Three.
4089380	4090380	Three, four.
4090380	4093380	As far as the rounds go, I guess technically two.
4093380	4094380	I don't know.
4094380	4095380	I'm not good with numbers.
4095380	4097380	It was Ben Affleck and...
4097380	4099380	Mark Wahlberg, Donald Loeg.
4099380	4102380	I'm going to go with Donald Loeg.
4102380	4104380	No!
4104380	4108380	That was Mark Wahlberg.
4108380	4116380	Hey, little dog.
4116380	4118380	It's a contextual impression.
4118380	4120380	You have to be talking to an animal.
4120380	4122380	You have to change the words, yeah.
4122380	4123380	Hey, buddy.
4123380	4124380	Hey, buddy.
4124380	4126380	I'm Mark Wahlberg.
4126380	4127380	All right.
4127380	4134380	Dan, your categories to choose from are Drink the Kool-Aid or La La Royalty.
4134380	4136380	Let's go drink the Kool-Aid.
4136380	4137380	All right.
4137380	4142380	This is a famous cult leader.
4142380	4145380	Shit.
4145380	4153380	You gain strength, courage, confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look for fear in the face.
4153380	4156380	You're able to say to yourself, I live through this home.
4156380	4158380	I can take this next thing that comes along.
4158380	4166380	You must do the thing that you think you cannot do.
4166380	4175380	So was that A, Charles Manson, B, Jim Jones, C, David Koresh.
4175380	4176380	Let's go with the first one.
4176380	4179380	That is correct.
4179380	4181380	Dan pulls ahead.
4181380	4183380	Three to two.
4183380	4189380	That was Bob Odenkirk's impression of Charles Manson from the 1992 Ben Stiller sketch,
4189380	4191380	which you should Google.
4191380	4192380	Watch online.
4192380	4193380	It's called Manson.
4193380	4194380	It's a lassie thing.
4194380	4195380	It's very funny.
4195380	4204380	Bethany, your choice is between La La Royalty and Come Together.
4204380	4206380	I'm going to do Come Together.
4206380	4207380	All right.
4207380	4215380	So this is a beetle.
4215380	4219380	Death and taxes and childbirth.
4219380	4224380	There's never any convenient time for any of them.
4224380	4228380	Also, that's just a beetle.
4228380	4231380	You averaged all the beetles.
4231380	4234380	That's your impression of all of them.
4234380	4242380	Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.
4242380	4252380	So is that A, John Lennon, B, Ringo Starr, C, Paul McCartney, D, George Harrison.
4252380	4259380	That is correct.
4259380	4268380	I always was the distinct one.
4268380	4274380	All right, Dan, La La Royalty or House of Incest.
4274380	4277380	Is that a Game of Thrones thing?
4277380	4279380	Let's go House of Incest.
4279380	4280380	All right.
4280380	4287380	This is a Lannister.
4287380	4290380	Peace is not an absence of war.
4290380	4302380	It is a virtue, a state of mind, a disposition for benevolence, confidence, justice.
4302380	4304380	Oh, shit.
4304380	4311380	Was that A, Jaime Lannister, B, Tyrion Lannister, C, Joffrey Lannister.
4311380	4314380	That is correct.
4314380	4315380	All right.
4315380	4316380	Final round.
4316380	4317380	Final round.
4317380	4319380	Okay, Bethany, you've got to get this to stay alive.
4319380	4321380	You have to get this right.
4321380	4322380	And I recommend you use your mail app.
4322380	4323380	I was going to say, I should use my mail app.
4323380	4326380	Because it's three to four right now.
4326380	4327380	Okay.
4327380	4330380	Oh, and this is worth two points.
4330380	4332380	Okay.
4332380	4333380	All right.
4333380	4334380	So you're tied.
4334380	4335380	Oh, no, no, no.
4335380	4336380	Oh, oh.
4336380	4337380	Oh, it's three to four.
4337380	4338380	No.
4338380	4341380	If she gets a, if it's, is it one or two?
4341380	4344380	If it's two, then whoever gets this right wins.
4344380	4345380	Oh, okay.
4345380	4348380	Unless she gets it wrong, then I'm fine.
4348380	4349380	Yeah.
4349380	4350380	All right.
4350380	4353380	I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to stick with my dumb suggestion.
4353380	4354380	That's two points.
4354380	4355380	All right.
4355380	4362380	So you get to choose between La La Royalty or good day, ladies.
4363380	4366380	Good day, ladies.
4366380	4367380	All right.
4367380	4372380	These are, this is an Australian actress.
4372380	4373380	Oh boy.
4373380	4374380	It's an Australian actress.
4374380	4376380	Take it away, Deb.
4376380	4385380	How much time he, Irish actress.
4385380	4388380	How much time he gains.
4388380	4391380	Who does not look to see what the neighbor says or does.
4391380	4395380	I want it terrible.
4395380	4396380	Yes.
4396380	4397380	It's bloody terrible.
4397380	4399380	You should have seen the other option.
4399380	4405380	I'm going to take a shorter quote.
4405380	4409380	Betches three hours too soon than a minute too late.
4409380	4411380	Thank you.
4411380	4412380	All right.
4412380	4413380	What's that?
4413380	4418380	A, Nicole Kidman, B, Kate Blanchett, or C, Tony Collette.
4418380	4420380	I see you itching at your Camille card.
4420380	4421380	I'm going to use my Camille card.
4421380	4422380	All right.
4422380	4423380	Camille card.
4423380	4429380	It's a, this Shakespeare one.
4429380	4434380	Better, better three hours too soon.
4434380	4437380	Okay.
4437380	4439380	All right.
4439380	4443380	I have to, okay.
4443380	4447380	I have, I'm going to make really dumb eyes for this one.
4447380	4452380	I have to make my eyes really empty.
4452380	4458380	Better three hours too soon than a minute too late.
4458380	4463380	Well done.
4463380	4464380	All right.
4464380	4467380	All right.
4467380	4469380	I think that actually helped.
4469380	4473380	So is that Nicole Kidman, Kate Blanchett, or Tony Collette?
4473380	4475380	I'm going to go with Nicole Kidman.
4475380	4480380	All right.
4480380	4484380	Who does not speak with an Australian accent.
4484380	4487380	It feels like she's from everywhere and nowhere.
4487380	4490380	It feels like the ocean birthed her.
4490380	4494380	She just, she comes up for a word show and she's got the glasses with the gown
4494380	4498380	and she, she speaks like a, like any old British person.
4498380	4500380	It's like a faint, faint accent.
4500380	4502380	Everyone has an accent.
4502380	4503380	All right.
4503380	4506380	So this is the final, this is the final question.
4506380	4513380	He made an expression after he said that, like the caption was nailed it.
4513380	4514380	Hashtag.
4514380	4515380	All right.
4515380	4516380	This is the final question.
4516380	4518380	Wait, I thought that was the final one.
4518380	4520380	Well, I really went down to do this one.
4520380	4521380	All right.
4521380	4522380	Okay.
4522380	4523380	So it's pretty good.
4523380	4525380	So this is, I mean, this is just, you know, pride, a pride question.
4525380	4527380	You got to get it right to win.
4527380	4530380	So this is the category lala royalty, which is famous.
4531380	4532380	You know that.
4532380	4533380	I don't know who this person is.
4533380	4534380	You don't know who that is?
4534380	4536380	No, I don't know who this person is.
4536380	4541380	Well, I, it looks like it just, what can you tell me who it is?
4547380	4548380	She can talk.
4548380	4549380	Can I see him?
4553380	4556380	It's more about the other two being.
4556380	4557380	Just try it.
4557380	4559380	Just try it.
4559380	4560380	Okay.
4560380	4561380	Great.
4561380	4562380	Just make a guess.
4562380	4563380	Really good.
4563380	4564380	She can talk.
4564380	4567380	Wait, what is this category?
4567380	4573380	This is a famous daughter's lala royalty of Hollywood.
4579380	4582380	Nothing but truth is lovely.
4582380	4585380	Nothing fair.
4585380	4588380	By the way, if there was a little girl that sounded like that.
4588380	4590380	Take her to the doctor.
4590380	4593380	Put in a bag and throw it in the river.
4593380	4594380	Yeah.
4594380	4596380	Throw that in the river.
4599380	4600380	Yeah.
4600380	4601380	Is that a tremor talking?
4601380	4602380	What is that?
4605380	4606380	I'm not the criminal here.
4606380	4609380	Like, like, look at this list of names she wrote down for me to do.
4609380	4612380	There's not a Vincent Price on here.
4612380	4614380	I only do three impressions.
4615380	4617380	Where's Liam Neeson?
4617380	4619380	Ask a Vincent Price.
4619380	4622380	Tell her that you want to do an impression of Liam Neeson.
4622380	4625380	How come you didn't let Dan do the right impressions?
4628380	4629380	All right.
4629380	4632380	Who was the goddamn person I did?
4632380	4633380	All right.
4633380	4641380	Was that A, Suri Cruz, B, Willow Smith, or C, Miley Cyrus?
4645380	4646380	What was the first one?
4646380	4647380	Suri Cruz.
4647380	4652380	I got to say, one of those three people's parents is way less of a megastar.
4652380	4655380	Like, Suri Cruz is Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
4655380	4657380	I mean, and Cake, whatever.
4657380	4658380	Katie Holmes.
4658380	4659380	Cake.
4659380	4660380	Just Cake.
4660380	4665380	Tom Cruise achieved a Thetan level so high, he can reproduce with Cake.
4665380	4668380	That's level 32.
4668380	4670380	It costs $780,000.
4670380	4673380	You achieve the ability to reproduce with Cake.
4675380	4678380	Willow Smith is Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith.
4678380	4683380	And then Miley Cyrus is Billy Ray Cyrus, who we didn't really know until Miley Cyrus
4683380	4685380	showed up.
4685380	4688380	That's why he's always such a permissive parent in all those interviews.
4688380	4689380	He's like, yeah, fuck it.
4689380	4690380	I don't care.
4690380	4692380	Well, you see some of her titty?
4692380	4693380	Good.
4693380	4694380	Good on her.
4694380	4697380	All the way to the bank.
4700380	4702380	Some of her titty.
4702380	4704380	So, Dan, who do you think it is?
4704380	4705380	Seriously, Suri Cruz.
4705380	4706380	That is correct.
4706380	4707380	Oh, Dan won.
4710380	4711380	Yeah.
4711380	4714380	Well, congratulations.
4714380	4715380	Wait, who won?
4715380	4716380	Dan won.
4716380	4717380	Oh, he did?
4717380	4718380	Oh.
4718380	4722380	He was behind and then he had a big comeback.
4722380	4726380	But I normally think this is lame when people do this.
4726380	4729380	But I want to give you guys both tickets.
4729380	4733380	Not that I think it's lame when people give people things.
4733380	4735380	They both get a pair of tickets, right?
4735380	4736380	Yeah.
4736380	4737380	They both get a pair of tickets.
4737380	4738380	That's awesome.
4738380	4739380	Oh, wow.
4739380	4740380	Thank you.
4740380	4741380	Thank you.
4747380	4748380	I could have made that shorter.
4748380	4750380	Did we miss anybody on there?
4750380	4752380	I mean, Sulu I could do.
4752380	4753380	Sulu was great.
4753380	4755380	Your Sulu was great, Dan.
4755380	4760380	Well, if I was to ever do this again again, I would mix it in with some ringers.
4760380	4761380	There would be more ringers.
4761380	4762380	I was trying to challenge you.
4762380	4765380	I thought maybe you discover a new impression that you do.
4765380	4766380	Yeah, yeah.
4766380	4768380	I thought my Paul F. Tompkins was kind of okay.
4768380	4769380	Yeah.
4771380	4775380	He has a jovial quality to it when he does interviews.
4775380	4778380	It's not like the way he talks actually at all.
4778380	4781380	Paul, what's your favorite afternoon snack?
4781380	4783380	I love Skittles.
4784380	4786380	Do you just eat them alone?
4786380	4790380	I eat them with a celebrity interview on Speakeasy.
4792380	4795380	It's a YouTube interview show that I was on.
4795380	4798380	You can see my episode coming up soon.
4799380	4800380	Should we bring Spencer out?
4800380	4802380	Yeah, let's bring Spencer out.
4808380	4811380	To mail, that was some hot comp trolling right there.
4811380	4812380	Yeah, what the fuck, right?
4812380	4813380	Mail again.
4813380	4815380	I almost just got murdered.
4815380	4817380	This guy stepped on his foot, not his fault.
4817380	4821380	But someone over there put their leg out to trip me like right as I was coming up.
4821380	4822380	Let's burn him.
4822380	4824380	Did you do it on purpose?
4824380	4826380	My leg was out, I didn't know he was coming up.
4826380	4828380	It's prom guy.
4828380	4829380	Did you go to prom?
4829380	4830380	I didn't go to prom.
4830380	4831380	You didn't?
4831380	4832380	No, I did.
4832380	4833380	I went to prom.
4833380	4835380	Where's the lady that you was here?
4835380	4836380	She's not here.
4836380	4839380	You know who is here?
4839380	4841380	Spencer!
4844380	4846380	You know, that guy almost fucking killed me.
4846380	4848380	You're giving him a whole thing.
4848380	4850380	He's the new Spencer.
4850380	4852380	He's the new Spencer, that's how we...
4852380	4853380	I can tell.
4853380	4854380	I can tell.
4854380	4855380	It's like Manuto.
4855380	4857380	No, I mean, you're fine probably.
4857380	4859380	Unless you actually were trying to kill me.
4859380	4861380	No, he didn't go to prom with what he said.
4861380	4863380	So, I mean, he's vengeance.
4863380	4864380	Why is he prom guy?
4864380	4865380	How do we know so much about this guy?
4865380	4868380	He was the guy that was with the girl and he asked her to do the prom
4868380	4869380	and she was really awkward about it.
4869380	4871380	Was that that very awkward thing that I did where I was like,
4871380	4872380	I know something, can I?
4872380	4874380	I thought you were really high.
4874380	4875380	Yeah, I must have been.
4875380	4876380	I don't remember any of this.
4876380	4878380	This is after the Renaissance Fair.
4878380	4880380	Oh, Renaissance Fair, yeah.
4880380	4882380	That's a blackout.
4882380	4884380	Yeah, I haven't listened to that one.
4884380	4886380	That was gone.
4886380	4888380	Spencer, did you...
4888380	4890380	Did you have a nice day?
4890380	4891380	Oh, that's right.
4891380	4892380	What?
4892380	4893380	What's up, sir?
4893380	4894380	Oh yeah, that was the cult day.
4894380	4895380	Yes, day great.
4895380	4897380	Saw Game of Thrones already.
4897380	4899380	Wait, you don't watch that show?
4899380	4900380	This guy knows.
4900380	4901380	What?
4901380	4902380	You don't watch that show?
4902380	4904380	No, I don't.
4904380	4907380	What kind of accusation is that?
4907380	4908380	Why wouldn't Spencer watch Game of Thrones?
4908380	4911380	You don't watch Silicon Valley?
4911380	4913380	You're not in Game of Thrones.
4913380	4915380	He basically is.
4915380	4918380	I mean, I can pull off that hat.
4918380	4920380	Do you really watch that show?
4920380	4922380	Yeah, why wouldn't you think of it?
4922380	4923380	Because you don't consume...
4923380	4924380	I'm hurt.
4924380	4925380	No, no, no.
4925380	4927380	You don't consume much like media.
4927380	4928380	Yeah, yeah.
4928380	4931380	He's never seen the Indiana Jones movies.
4931380	4932380	Well, I watch TV.
4932380	4933380	That's the thing.
4933380	4936380	I'm more of a TV guy than a movie guy.
4936380	4937380	He likes the news stuff.
4937380	4940380	You like Desperate Maids.
4940380	4942380	Desperate Maids.
4942380	4943380	What was it called?
4943380	4944380	Devious Maids, right?
4944380	4949380	Desperate Maids of Orange County.
4949380	4950380	No, no.
4950380	4951380	Devious Maids.
4951380	4956380	Real Dungeon Masters of Simi Valley.
4956380	4957380	There's just one of them.
4957380	4958380	That's me.
4958380	4960380	Well, that's how the story starts.
4960380	4962380	That's you saying that, and you're like,
4962380	4964380	there's just one of them, and it's me.
4964380	4966380	And you snap, and then it cuts to another guy.
4966380	4970380	And he's like, I am the premier dungeon master of Simi Valley.
4970380	4973380	And then the show makes you all go to a party together,
4973380	4977380	and you end up pulling each other's hair and diving into a pool.
4977380	4981380	That does sound real.
4981380	4982380	So...
4982380	4984380	Did you like the Game of Thrones you saw?
4984380	4986380	Uh, no.
4986380	4987380	No, no, no.
4987380	4988380	I'm just saying I didn't like it.
4988380	4991380	Whether he liked it or not is not a spoiler, you Nazis.
4991380	4993380	Yeah.
4993380	4994380	I didn't like it.
4994380	4995380	You did like it.
4995380	4997380	I think it was a great episode, but I don't like it.
4997380	4999380	I don't like a lot of great things.
4999380	5000380	I don't like a lot of great music.
5000380	5003380	No, we honestly can't, because I was about to ask.
5003380	5005380	I'm not going to spoil anything.
5005380	5008380	I think everyone's going to really enjoy it.
5008380	5011380	Uh...
5011380	5014380	I'm just saying words to throw you guys all off guard.
5014380	5016380	Yay!
5016380	5018380	Do you understand what's going on?
5018380	5020380	Yeah, Dumbledore dies, right?
5021380	5023380	Hey!
5023380	5025380	Spoiler, buddy.
5025380	5029380	Were you the kid that was running around telling everyone that Dumbledore died?
5029380	5030380	Oh, yeah.
5030380	5033380	We went to the book release night at two different boarders.
5038380	5039380	Did you really do that?
5039380	5044380	Yeah, when you work at bookstores for a long time, you start to hate books and people who like them.
5046380	5047380	Did you work at a bookstore?
5047380	5048380	Yeah, yeah.
5048380	5051380	Before I worked at the used bookstore, I worked at Borders Borders.
5051380	5053380	Are there still boarders?
5053380	5054380	Nope.
5054380	5055380	Are there still any bookstores?
5055380	5056380	Just like vintage ones.
5056380	5058380	There's Barnes and Noble, you know.
5058380	5059380	They're kicking.
5059380	5063380	I wonder if they should split into a Barnes and a Noble.
5064380	5066380	Happy Father's Day.
5066380	5069380	Who are Barnes and Noble?
5069380	5072380	Why did they put their name on?
5072380	5073380	Fuck those guys.
5073380	5075380	I'm going to find out everything about them right now.
5075380	5076380	Who's Vaughn?
5076380	5077380	An Albertson?
5077380	5082380	That goes to show you like how amazing...
5082380	5085380	I do know Jason Subway, though.
5086380	5093380	You know that books were really popular and you couldn't take your business elsewhere because the bookstore's names are so shitty.
5093380	5094380	Like Barnes and Noble.
5094380	5100380	Like, you know, if books had to be invented today, you'd have to call them something like Laser Blowjob.
5100380	5106380	Like the store would have to be called like Mega Max Super Read.
5107380	5112380	I publish Super Dick Book Fuck Pussy.
5112380	5115380	So is a Laser Blowjob really precise?
5115380	5116380	Yeah.
5116380	5117380	Oh, yeah.
5117380	5119380	It goes right to, you know, where we like it.
5119380	5120380	No, no, no.
5120380	5121380	Not that part of skin.
5121380	5122380	That part of skin.
5122380	5125380	It says zero teeth.
5126380	5127380	Zero teeth.
5127380	5130380	That's the guarantee of a Laser Blowjob.
5130380	5131380	I know.
5131380	5132380	Those don't really exist, though.
5132380	5133380	That's an urban myth.
5133380	5135380	You've heard it a thousand times before.
5135380	5143380	This is like a guy, the spokesman of the commercial that's on an all-black set, like an onyx set, and he's walking towards camera in his gray suit.
5143380	5145380	He's like, like, of course, it's a blowjob.
5145380	5147380	There's going to be some teeth.
5147380	5149380	That is now a matter of the past.
5149380	5157380	With Laser Blowjobs, and then they do this CG thing, and it just spirals around your dick, and...
5157380	5162380	And then it just cuts to these testimonials of guys going like, I couldn't believe it.
5163380	5166380	You think blowjob, the little bit of teeth, it's okay.
5166380	5168380	It's like rat hair in your cereal.
5174380	5177380	On paper, Laser Blowjobs sounds horrible.
5180380	5184380	There's a final guy that's like, it's hardly even a job anymore.
5187380	5188380	I feel like I just got blown.
5188380	5189380	Yeah.
5190380	5194380	There's a whole backlash to Laser Blowjobs that are like, you know, I like the teeth.
5194380	5195380	I thought they were okay.
5195380	5196380	Oh, yeah.
5196380	5198380	Oh, those are the hipsters at Silver Lake.
5200380	5202380	The David Cross character with the scarf.
5203380	5206380	Blowjobs are supposed to involve teeth.
5206380	5208380	That's the point of them.
5210380	5212380	It makes them feel better.
5214380	5215380	Okay, anyways.
5216380	5217380	Yeah.
5217380	5218380	Teeth.
5218380	5219380	What?
5219380	5220380	Teeth.
5220380	5222380	Don't make us drag it out of you.
5222380	5224380	Did you bring a D&D adventure for us tonight?
5224380	5225380	Oh, yeah.
5225380	5226380	I mean, I'm here.
5226380	5228380	Well, I don't assume anything about you.
5228380	5229380	That's good.
5229380	5230380	That's safe.
5231380	5233380	Have you been enjoying being my assistant?
5234380	5235380	Yes.
5238380	5239380	Conflict of interests.
5240380	5241380	All right.
5241380	5242380	All right.
5242380	5243380	Well, nothing else to talk about.
5243380	5245380	Father's Day, did you talk to your dad today?
5245380	5246380	Yeah.
5246380	5247380	You know, my dad's in...
5247380	5248380	Rehab?
5248380	5249380	It's in a not American country.
5249380	5250380	I'm not sure which.
5250380	5251380	It's terrible.
5251380	5252380	I think it's...
5252380	5253380	I think it's Colombia.
5253380	5254380	Why does he...
5254380	5255380	Might be Brazil.
5255380	5256380	Why does he go?
5256380	5258380	He lives there now.
5258380	5259380	What?
5259380	5260380	Your dad moved to Colombia?
5260380	5261380	Yeah.
5261380	5262380	You know, a lot of things happen.
5262380	5263380	A lot of things happen.
5263380	5266380	And you're not sure which country your dad moved to?
5266380	5268380	Once it's out of America, it's like, who cares?
5268380	5270380	I can't do anything about it.
5270380	5272380	Did your dad move there for work?
5272380	5273380	Yeah.
5273380	5274380	Well, I mean, he's hoping to get work.
5274380	5275380	He's just moving there.
5275380	5276380	Yeah.
5276380	5278380	I mean, my parents, they're doing all sorts of crazy shit now, you know?
5278380	5280380	My mom's, like, traveling the country.
5280380	5281380	I don't know.
5281380	5285380	They got all this money that I'm sure I'm never going to get now.
5285380	5288380	Just spending it on being alone.
5291380	5292380	I guess.
5294380	5296380	I have to be alone broke.
5296380	5297380	It sucks.
5297380	5299380	Anyway, well, my dad sent me a letter.
5299380	5300380	He got...
5300380	5303380	He found a pickpocket's hand in his pocket, and he punched him in the face.
5303380	5304380	Jesus.
5304380	5308380	And it made me realize my dad has punched a lot of people in the face.
5308380	5311380	Like, he punched a different guy in the face that he thought was stealing
5311380	5312380	something from him.
5312380	5313380	We don't know if he actually was.
5313380	5314380	I saw...
5314380	5318380	He ripped the rear view mirror off of a car of a guy that was driving too fast
5318380	5321380	in a parking lot, and then he threw it at him.
5321380	5324380	He didn't hit the car with it, but it's just...
5324380	5326380	There's such malice there.
5326380	5329380	I mean, I love my dad, but apparently violent.
5329380	5332380	Everyone deals with divorce in different ways.
5332380	5334380	That was all before...
5334380	5335380	That's all normal.
5335380	5336380	That's part of the course.
5336380	5340380	Divorce was the mirror he should have been ripping off the car.
5340380	5343380	He was coming up in unhealthy ways.
5343380	5345380	Finally, he was like, oh, wait.
5345380	5347380	I don't have to punch other men.
5347380	5349380	I can just break up my family.
5349380	5351380	I can punch my marriage.
5352380	5355380	So they really are separated.
5355380	5356380	Yeah.
5356380	5357380	He's in a different country.
5357380	5358380	When did this happen?
5358380	5359380	How long ago?
5359380	5360380	I don't know.
5360380	5363380	It was right after he came on the show, and he came up behind the table,
5363380	5367380	and he was going, hey, I'm Spencer's dad, and then...
5367380	5368380	It was after that?
5368380	5369380	After that?
5369380	5370380	I don't know.
5370380	5372380	I think our show broke up your parents.
5372380	5373380	Yeah, no, definitely.
5373380	5376380	I mean, well, I was always confident that once I left,
5376380	5377380	there would be nothing left,
5377380	5380380	because my parents were always using me as the crutch.
5380380	5383380	They'd be like, oh, I don't know what I'm going to do about your father.
5383380	5384380	I don't know about...
5384380	5386380	And it's like, well, I can't be the...
5386380	5388380	That's not going to fail.
5388380	5389380	You guys want me out of here.
5389380	5391380	Let's stay together for the kids.
5391380	5393380	Our kids are Grizzly Adams.
5393380	5394380	Yeah.
5394380	5395380	I mean...
5395380	5397380	Our kids are seven feet tall.
5397380	5401380	When all my friends' parents were getting divorced back in middle school and high school,
5401380	5403380	it seemed so fashionable and cool.
5403380	5405380	Like, I definitely could have cashed it in back then.
5405380	5407380	Now it's just like, fucking deal with it.
5407380	5409380	You're 25, you piece of shit.
5409380	5411380	Like, I don't have any pity anymore.
5411380	5412380	That's exactly right.
5412380	5415380	Once you hit your 20s, your parents' divorcing is just kind of weird.
5415380	5416380	Yeah.
5416380	5418380	That's how I feel about eyeglasses.
5419380	5420380	I was like...
5424380	5426380	But slid forward 10 years.
5426380	5429380	Throughout my 20s, I would have been so hot with fucking glasses.
5429380	5432380	I was in the fucking Costco optometrist every day.
5432380	5434380	Are you sure I don't need them yet?
5434380	5437380	Because I'd be pretty hot with them.
5437380	5440380	And now my eyes are probably a little weaker.
5440380	5441380	I'll eventually go in.
5441380	5444380	I'll just look like fucking Mr. Roper.
5444380	5446380	No, you look like a professor.
5446380	5447380	I'm excited about it.
5447380	5448380	She's getting turned on.
5448380	5449380	Okay.
5450380	5451380	All right.
5451380	5454380	Someone's getting a Teethy Blowjob.
5455380	5456380	Teethy?
5457380	5459380	I just want you to know I'm there.
5462380	5465380	That's a step up from Teethy Blowjob.
5465380	5466380	Teethy.
5467380	5469380	All of the teeth are involved.
5471380	5474380	Every single one makes an appearance.
5475380	5477380	They can't be or some of the molars.
5477380	5479380	Not just the vestigial blowjob tooth
5479380	5482380	that a bird uses to get out of its shell.
5485380	5487380	I just want him to know I'm here.
5489380	5490380	All right.
5490380	5492380	That's the sound Teethy Blowjob.
5497380	5500380	Have either of you received such a job
5500380	5503380	and not said anything and just kind of suffered through it?
5503380	5506380	If you don't ever say anything, you kind of be like,
5506380	5509380	hey, first of all, thank you so much.
5509380	5513380	Listen, forever in your debt, debt, et cetera.
5513380	5514380	Definitely.
5514380	5516380	You don't give someone notes on their performance
5516380	5517380	at a soup kitchen.
5517380	5518380	Yeah.
5518380	5520380	Hey, you kind of...
5521380	5524380	Hey, kind of an asshole with that ladle.
5525380	5526380	Oh, really?
5526380	5529380	Maybe I should never come back here ever again.
5530380	5532380	No, thank you for coming down here and giving out soup.
5532380	5533380	Yeah.
5533380	5535380	You're a hero.
5535380	5537380	It's not the best soup I've ever had,
5537380	5539380	but it's fucking soup.
5540380	5543380	Even terrible soup is better than no soup.
5546380	5547380	You guys are nice guys.
5547380	5549380	I think in the past, I think that...
5549380	5550380	You can say something.
5550380	5553380	I think if somebody asks, if somebody asks for notes.
5553380	5554380	Really?
5554380	5555380	Really?
5555380	5557380	I'm always like A plus.
5557380	5558380	At pillow talk, if they go...
5558380	5559380	I guess I'll be asking.
5559380	5560380	Do you like the way I...
5561380	5563380	I was like, really?
5564380	5566380	And then I start with the...
5566380	5569380	I go, your fucking ace is great.
5569380	5570380	Yeah.
5570380	5571380	No problem.
5571380	5572380	Thanks for doing it.
5572380	5576380	And then if pressed for it, if there were teeth involved,
5576380	5579380	I might say, oh, I guess maybe...
5580380	5583380	Do you know that I don't want your teeth involved?
5583380	5585380	Oh, there's one more thing.
5586380	5587380	It's super painful.
5587380	5590380	Isn't that kind of a crazy thing to just kind of let go?
5590380	5591380	Well, they might...
5591380	5592380	If someone were like...
5592380	5593380	They might know.
5593380	5594380	It was the other way around.
5594380	5597380	Listen, no one's like gnawing on your thing down there.
5597380	5598380	That's not happening.
5598380	5600380	But no, no one's gnawing on my thing.
5601380	5603380	It's just like a bit of rat hair in your cereal.
5604380	5605380	Right, right.
5605380	5607380	So it just comes in and...
5607380	5610380	Yeah, I would take the worst blowjob I've ever had
5610380	5612380	over the best pizza I've ever eaten.
5613380	5616380	Yeah, I mean, if the goal becomes for some strange scientific purpose,
5616380	5618380	you're like, okay, let's create the perfect blowjob.
5618380	5621380	All right, you want to go down this road, I guess we could try.
5621380	5626380	But I have a feeling the notes would result in a lot of...
5626380	5627380	They'd probably be...
5627380	5629380	No more blowjobs.
5629380	5630380	Well, I don't know.
5630380	5632380	Or the next time, it's like, like this?
5632380	5633380	Like you said?
5633380	5634380	Okay, all right.
5634380	5636380	You don't have to be sarcastic.
5637380	5639380	Yeah, keep your blowjobs sincere.
5640380	5643380	I said ballplay, not racquetball.
5643380	5645380	Yeah, I don't need an ironic blowjob.
5647380	5650380	I wish there was a cooler term than blowjob.
5650380	5652380	Blowjob sounds so...
5652380	5654380	Or ballplay or teethy or anything.
5654380	5658380	First of all, like suckjob is a much more descriptive...
5658380	5660380	Well, do you know, I read this somewhere...
5660380	5661380	No one's ever blowing on that.
5661380	5665380	The etymology of the word blowjob is...
5665380	5669380	They think comes from the idea of...
5669380	5671380	It's not what you think.
5671380	5676380	It's not the idea that the vendor of the...
5678380	5679380	The merchant...
5679380	5682380	I was going to say woman and then I was like 2014?
5682380	5683380	Yeah, no, you're right.
5683380	5684380	Who knows?
5684380	5687380	The vendor is way more sensitive.
5687380	5688380	The provider.
5688380	5690380	The giver, yeah.
5690380	5695380	The idea isn't that that person is doing anything,
5695380	5697380	blowing, sucking, anything.
5697380	5698380	It's nothing to do with that.
5698380	5701380	It comes from the idea of blowing off steam.
5701380	5708380	It's the receiver blowing, blowing his wad,
5708380	5711380	blowing his load, blowing...
5711380	5713380	It's a Victorian sleigh.
5713380	5715380	It's a Victorian sleigh.
5715380	5718380	Because it was like a quick dirty,
5718380	5720380	like give him a blowjob.
5720380	5722380	Let him blow off his steam.
5722380	5723380	Yeah, let him relax a little.
5723380	5727380	It's a steampunk terminology.
5727380	5730380	I really think that's how they understood
5730380	5733380	humanity to work had to do with steam.
5733380	5734380	And it comes from that.
5734380	5735380	That's what I read.
5735380	5737380	I was like, oh, that actually makes so much more sense
5737380	5738380	than all these years of going like,
5738380	5740380	yeah, why do they...
5740380	5741380	Yeah.
5741380	5742380	Stop it.
5742380	5743380	Stop doing that.
5743380	5744380	I'm not a balloon.
5744380	5747380	Yeah, I'll take teeth over there.
5748380	5750380	I thought when I was a kid,
5750380	5752380	I didn't know what it was.
5752380	5753380	I'd heard the term.
5753380	5755380	I thought it was that the point was
5755380	5759380	for the person to blow air into the hole.
5759380	5760380	Yeah, yeah.
5760380	5761380	And that's what felt really good.
5761380	5762380	Of course you would think that.
5762380	5765380	I was like, I wanted to inflate all the way.
5765380	5766380	Of course you would think that
5766380	5768380	because when you're a kid,
5768380	5770380	you have a little wiener and you look down at it
5770380	5771380	and the obvious analog is...
5771380	5772380	It's like a little hole, yeah.
5772380	5774380	...is the stem on the basketball
5774380	5776380	or the tire of your dirt bike.
5776380	5779380	Like, you go like, oh, a blowjob.
5779380	5781380	I'm going to get a blowjob one day.
5781380	5783380	Oh, I guess that'll be when someone
5783380	5787380	bumps me up with this little doo-dat down here.
5788380	5789380	Would that feel good?
5789380	5790380	Maybe.
5790380	5792380	I doubt it.
5792380	5794380	I bet it wouldn't feel terrible.
5794380	5796380	I mean, yeah, in a world where...
5796380	5798380	But if you had like a compressed air thing
5798380	5800380	that you used to clean off like your keyboard...
5800380	5801380	Well, that would feel weird.
5801380	5803380	I bet that would feel good.
5803380	5805380	I'm not talking about like inserting it
5805380	5806380	into the urethra.
5806380	5807380	I'm talking about like...
5807380	5809380	Three inches away, like it's a circuit board.
5809380	5810380	Oh, yeah.
5810380	5811380	I didn't really...
5811380	5813380	Like if you were really trying to dust it off.
5813380	5814380	I bet that would feel good.
5814380	5815380	I bet it's great.
5815380	5816380	There's always some splatter in that,
5816380	5817380	you know, the liquid that's always in there.
5817380	5818380	Oh, it frees your dick.
5818380	5819380	Yeah.
5819380	5820380	No, burn your dick.
5820380	5821380	Burn it?
5821380	5822380	Yeah, like, you know, the frostbite.
5822380	5824380	But like a fun burn.
5824380	5826380	There's very little...
5826380	5828380	There's very little you can do to the deck
5828380	5829380	that would really hurt it
5829380	5830380	and you'd know what it is.
5830380	5831380	If you're like,
5831380	5832380	with this hurt it or not,
5832380	5833380	it probably won't, it'll be great.
5833380	5835380	There's very little fun in burning something.
5835380	5837380	But it's like a freeze burn.
5837380	5838380	Like candles.
5838380	5839380	It is like a freeze burn.
5839380	5840380	I don't see your point.
5840380	5841380	That's still bad.
5841380	5842380	No, but listen.
5842380	5844380	Like take down your pants.
5844380	5845380	Someone grab a thing.
5845380	5846380	I mean, listen.
5846380	5847380	It would feel like having your tongue
5847380	5848380	stuck to a frozen pole,
5848380	5849380	except it's your dick.
5849380	5851380	It would be terrible.
5851380	5852380	I'm sure it's fine.
5852380	5855380	I've had that spray stuff on my hand
5855380	5856380	in my body.
5856380	5858380	It burns for minutes.
5858380	5859380	But it burns...
5859380	5861380	But it burns fun, right?
5861380	5863380	In the way that inflicting pain
5863380	5864380	on yourself is fun.
5864380	5865380	Like sometimes you prick yourself
5865380	5867380	with like a thumbtack and that's fun.
5867380	5868380	It's not...
5868380	5869380	Like when you get your dick involved,
5869380	5870380	that's a whole...
5870380	5871380	Oh, yeah.
5871380	5873380	I mean, I'm masochistic, sure.
5873380	5875380	Okay, I've done that freeze thing
5875380	5876380	to myself all the time.
5876380	5878380	And it's like a fun burn.
5878380	5879380	But that's your arm.
5879380	5880380	It's not like a thumbtack.
5880380	5881380	Wait, are you joking?
5881380	5882380	It really burns.
5882380	5884380	You use compressed air on your penis?
5884380	5886380	No, but I've got it on my arm
5886380	5887380	and it feels fine
5887380	5889380	and I had never thought of it until now
5889380	5891380	and I swear to you, within a week,
5891380	5893380	I won't do it.
5893380	5895380	Tonight in Los Angeles,
5895380	5896380	the staples are gonna be...
5896380	5897380	Yeah.
5897380	5898380	So there's gonna be a...
5898380	5900380	I swear.
5900380	5901380	While you guys were talking in my head,
5901380	5903380	I was like, well, it's after 10.
5903380	5906380	Staples is gonna be closed when I'm here.
5906380	5907380	Hey, did you ever hear that thing?
5907380	5908380	Did you ever talk about that thing,
5908380	5910380	that tape head cleaner thing
5910380	5912380	with the tape head cleaner?
5912380	5913380	Speaking of staples
5913380	5915380	and things you can buy there
5915380	5917380	for sexual purposes,
5917380	5922380	there's a VHS head cleaner fluid.
5922380	5925380	That's like a thing that people would huff it
5925380	5928380	and it dilates your butt hole.
5930380	5931380	Yes, it does.
5931380	5935380	Which I didn't even think dilating it would be like,
5935380	5937380	like, why would you...
5937380	5938380	Well...
5938380	5939380	Oh, make it nice and big.
5939380	5940380	Well, no.
5940380	5941380	That's not what I wanted
5941380	5944380	when I looked at you across the room.
5944380	5947380	I didn't wanna dilated butt hole.
5947380	5950380	I wanna snug little...
5950380	5952380	But even dilated, I'm better.
5952380	5953380	Gluff finger.
5953380	5956380	I'm assuming putting myself in the shoes
5956380	5960380	of a man about town.
5960380	5962380	What am I in the market for?
5962380	5964380	I want it good and dilated.
5964380	5965380	Well, then...
5965380	5967380	Well, then just get a bucket of water.
5967380	5970380	Put it in a coffee cup.
5970380	5971380	I don't know.
5971380	5973380	Is it the idea that it's tiny?
5973380	5974380	No.
5974380	5975380	No?
5975380	5978380	But even a dotted butt hole is pretty tiny.
5978380	5979380	Probably.
5979380	5981380	Isn't the idea more about the receiver's pleasure
5981380	5983380	when it comes to dilating your butt hole?
5983380	5984380	Yeah, it's about relaxing.
5984380	5985380	Oh, okay.
5985380	5986380	Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get that.
5986380	5987380	And your prostate and the way your body is,
5987380	5988380	it's not like...
5988380	5989380	Okay.
5989380	5991380	Like the brain wants...
5991380	5993380	The reach exceeds the grasp.
5993380	5995380	You're like, I want something up my butt,
5995380	5997380	but my butt doesn't know that.
5997380	6000380	My butt's just doing its job.
6000380	6001380	It's keeping everything in.
6001380	6002380	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6002380	6003380	But my butt doesn't know...
6003380	6004380	But I want...
6004380	6005380	Yeah, I'm Timothy.
6005380	6006380	I want...
6006380	6007380	I want it.
6007380	6008380	I want it.
6008380	6010380	I want something up there.
6010380	6012380	So then you go to Staples.
6012380	6013380	Yeah.
6013380	6014380	You're like...
6014380	6015380	Boing.
6015380	6016380	Is that the sound?
6016380	6018380	And then...
6018380	6022380	Mr. Henderson, I'm here to clean your pool.
6022380	6025380	Now I'm just writing a whole gay porno.
6025380	6026380	Yeah.
6026380	6027380	Timothy and Mr. Henderson.
6027380	6028380	Yeah.
6028380	6029380	Oh, thank you, Timothy.
6029380	6031380	I have on this extra tape cleaner,
6031380	6032380	and these things are...
6032380	6035380	I'm not even using a VHS player anymore.
6035380	6036380	Oh, geez, Mr. Henderson.
6036380	6038380	I just came from Staples.
6038380	6040380	I'll clean the pool now.
6040380	6044380	Now, Tommy, are you saying you like to go to Staples?
6044380	6047380	Oh, geez, you know, it's the one-stop trip
6047380	6050380	for all your office supply needs.
6050380	6052380	Boy, you know, Mr. Henderson,
6052380	6054380	you really ought to put more chlorine in your pool.
6054380	6057380	There's like a lot of plankton in here.
6058380	6061380	Swish, swish, swish, swish.
6061380	6064380	That sounds like Rick, doesn't it?
6064380	6065380	Morty.
6065380	6066380	Morty.
6066380	6067380	Morty.
6067380	6068380	Morty.
6068380	6069380	Tommy!
6069380	6070380	Yeah, it sounds like Morty.
6070380	6071380	All right, okay.
6071380	6072380	All right.
6072380	6073380	Well...
6073380	6074380	Should we do some D&D?
6074380	6075380	Yeah, we've got 11 minutes to move.
6075380	6076380	Oh, we need another person, right?
6076380	6077380	Do we?
6077380	6078380	We could...
6078380	6080380	Oh, you would play Jeff's character
6080380	6081380	because you're a comptroller.
6081380	6083380	Aaron would play Mulrain.
6083380	6086380	Yeah, I guess we need to volunteer to...
6086380	6087380	Dan.
6087380	6088380	Who's really earned...
6088380	6090380	Well, Dan had his moment of the sun.
6090380	6092380	I'll be Christopher.
6092380	6095380	Wait, let's not...
6095380	6096380	Well, actually, let's use that guy
6096380	6097380	because otherwise he'll be so embarrassed
6097380	6100380	that he shouted that out, right?
6100380	6101380	What?
6101380	6102380	Someone said I'll be Christopher.
6102380	6103380	Who said that?
6103380	6104380	Come on up.
6108380	6110380	Hello, what is your name?
6110380	6111380	I'm Mark.
6111380	6112380	Mark.
6112380	6113380	Mark, everybody.
6113380	6114380	Hey, how's it going, guys?
6115380	6117380	And Mark is wearing a shirt that says Cocksparrow.
6117380	6118380	Cocksparrow.
6118380	6119380	Oh, okay.
6120380	6121380	Mark, are you from L.A.?
6121380	6124380	I'm from San Diego, but I moved to L.A. like two years ago.
6124380	6125380	Oh, where in San Diego?
6125380	6127380	Escondido, North County.
6127380	6130380	Cool, I'm from Rancho Bernardo.
6130380	6131380	Are you really?
6131380	6132380	Yeah, man.
6132380	6133380	Those are adjacent cities.
6133380	6134380	I know.
6134380	6135380	I worked at that mall.
6135380	6136380	I worked at Hot Topic at Escondido.
6136380	6137380	Oh, my God.
6137380	6138380	Are you kidding me?
6138380	6139380	No, I'm not kidding.
6139380	6145380	You probably saw you pubescent me walk in there and buy, like, wrist guards and weird,
6145380	6146380	like, stuff like that.
6146380	6147380	Oh, right.
6147380	6148380	Cool.
6148380	6149380	Why are you?
6149380	6150380	Why does it sound like you're mocking him?
6150380	6151380	Yeah.
6152380	6154380	Is that the San Diego accent?
6154380	6155380	I'm not, I'm not mocking him.
6155380	6157380	I guess it does sound like I'm mocking him.
6157380	6158380	I just wanted to do his accent.
6158380	6160380	And it does remind me of home.
6160380	6163380	And I guess I did talk like that for a long time.
6163380	6164380	And I worked at Hot Topic.
6164380	6165380	I didn't know that was a San Diego accent.
6165380	6166380	It just sounds like, oh, cool, yeah.
6166380	6167380	Did you do that?
6167380	6168380	Oh, awesome.
6169380	6171380	You fucking piece of human shit.
6172380	6173380	Sounds great.
6173380	6174380	Well, I'll take 10.
6174380	6175380	Yeah.
6175380	6176380	Fuck this.
6178380	6180380	What'd you have for breakfast this morning?
6180380	6181380	Oh, rad.
6181380	6182380	Fuck off.
6186380	6188380	Gets a little gnarly down there.
6188380	6189380	That's good, gnarly.
6189380	6190380	Yeah, yeah.
6190380	6192380	Do you board?
6192380	6193380	I don't board.
6193380	6194380	I'm sorry.
6194380	6195380	No board.
6195380	6197380	Do you dilate your butt?
6198380	6199380	Also, how old are you?
6201380	6202380	Before I...
6203380	6206380	Because you may have come here with your dad for Father's Day.
6207380	6210380	No, my dad's an Escondido boarding, don't worry about it.
6210380	6211380	Okay.
6211380	6212380	All right.
6212380	6213380	Cleaning VHS tapes.
6213380	6214380	All right.
6214380	6218380	We're going to do a little eight-minute lightning round of D&D.
6218380	6219380	Yeah.
6219380	6220380	So who is a...
6220380	6221380	It's Mark, right?
6221380	6222380	Yeah.
6223380	6224380	Mark will be playing...
6225380	6226380	They should be in a word.
6226380	6227380	Christopher Berg.
6227380	6228380	I wish we could play for longer.
6228380	6230380	I kind of like the eight minutes, to be honest.
6230380	6232380	Oh, sometimes we go over time.
6232380	6233380	Yeah.
6233380	6234380	Oh, it's a little fast.
6234380	6235380	We've got 10 minutes.
6235380	6236380	I can't trust anybody.
6236380	6237380	Oh, here, pass them down.
6237380	6238380	I got mine.
6238380	6239380	Thank you.
6239380	6240380	Sorry.
6240380	6241380	A clock's a machine.
6243380	6244380	Thank you.
6244380	6245380	Can't argue with that.
6245380	6252380	I found a top-down turn-based RPG today that I might like.
6252380	6254380	I can't remember what it's called.
6254380	6255380	iOS game?
6255380	6256380	Swords and Liberty.
6256380	6258380	I love both of those things.
6260380	6263380	It's got a really generic name, and there's no...
6263380	6264380	I just really like...
6264380	6266380	I've been searching forever for just...
6266380	6268380	I just want a nice top-down turn-based RPG.
6268380	6269380	Yeah.
6269380	6270380	I love strategy.
6270380	6271380	Dungeon crawler.
6271380	6272380	Oberon?
6272380	6273380	Pokemon.
6273380	6274380	Oh, Pokemon.
6275380	6276380	Wait.
6276380	6277380	People love the new...
6277380	6278380	Diablo 3 is supposed to be good.
6278380	6279380	Dark Souls.
6279380	6280380	That's not turn-based.
6280380	6281380	Dark Souls is not top...
6281380	6282380	No, fuck Dark Souls, man.
6282380	6283380	You tried that.
6283380	6286380	It's the Sudoku of video games.
6287380	6288380	Oh, I should have...
6288380	6292380	I guess I'll start over, and this time I'll wear corn for a hat.
6293380	6294380	That was the old...
6294380	6298380	That was the big mistake I made that cost me three hours.
6299380	6302380	That's how your Sudoku experience is?
6302380	6303380	Yeah.
6303380	6305380	Sudoku, I tried it once, and I'm like,
6305380	6307380	oh, this is kind of fun, and then I realized...
6307380	6308380	You needed a different hat.
6308380	6309380	After six hours, I was like,
6309380	6311380	oh, I haven't been doing this right at all.
6312380	6313380	Okay.
6313380	6314380	Cool.
6315380	6317380	Well, I mean, is Dustin gonna music me?
6317380	6318380	Am I gonna...
6318380	6319380	Yeah, yeah.
6319380	6320380	All right, here we go.
6320380	6321380	Sorry, everybody.
6321380	6322380	I'm a diva.
6323380	6325380	I require musical stuff.
6326380	6328380	Last time on Harmon Town.
6328380	6332380	Our heroes had made it to the floating Isle of Paradise.
6333380	6337380	With the help and unwitting sacrifice of the Seekers of Paradise,
6337380	6338380	they had arrived.
6338380	6341380	And after mating and greeting with Yomiji,
6341380	6343380	the angelic guardian of the realm,
6343380	6348380	they found the Teragon of Virtue and used it to cure Krista Berg,
6348380	6352380	unleashing the demonic and ghostly Admiral Darkstar,
6352380	6357380	who possessed Yomiji's body and compelled the angel into mortal combat.
6357380	6360380	In the fierce battle, the island caught fire,
6360380	6364380	enveloping into the field of battle in blazing flames and choking smoke.
6364380	6366380	The gang resolved to escape,
6366380	6369380	but then quickly changed their minds, deciding to fight,
6369380	6374380	activating their armulets and unleashing their elemental powers.
6374380	6380380	But even Gwork's sleep could not extinguish the consuming conflagration of the island.
6380380	6383380	The gang fired arrows and slashed at Yomiji,
6383380	6385380	but nothing seemed to be working.
6385380	6389380	Finally, Sharpie had a quick burst of insight
6389380	6392380	and blasted the angel with reduced person,
6392380	6395380	shrinking his form by half,
6395380	6398380	turning the hulking Arkin into an average Chad.
6398380	6402380	But would our heroes be able to cut down their fun-sized foe,
6402380	6406380	or would the fun fail to free our friends from fate's fiddling fingers?
6406380	6410380	Find out next time on Harmontown.
6416380	6419380	I guess people like alliteration.
6419380	6422380	How do I get to? It's fun.
6422380	6424380	Questions?
6424380	6426380	There always are.
6426380	6432380	What if we did a practical joke on Spencer where we all just sat here in silence?
6432380	6436380	I guess he would just slowly kill us with this rampaging monster.
6436380	6439380	Okay, so, distracted by your alliteration,
6439380	6443380	our exact circumstances are that we shrunk this guy,
6443380	6446380	but we were going to head back for the portal, right?
6446380	6449380	Yeah, before the last episode, you were like,
6449380	6450380	let's run!
6450380	6452380	And then at the top of the last episode, you were like,
6452380	6453380	let's not run!
6453380	6455380	And then you started fighting, so that's what was happening.
6455380	6458380	But didn't we, were we running back for the portal,
6458380	6459380	or were we just fighting this guy?
6459380	6462380	You had reduced him to half his normal size.
6462380	6464380	He's the size of a mere man.
6464380	6466380	Alright, let's kick this guy's ass.
6466380	6469380	But knowing that once we do, this spirit will be free,
6469380	6472380	and that's the futile part of it.
6472380	6474380	You stand, you stand amid...
6475380	6478380	You stand amid the flaming isle of paradise surrounding,
6478380	6481380	you're surrounding the six foot tall Yomiji.
6481380	6484380	It's hard to see because smoke blocks out the sky
6484380	6486380	and wind whips past your faces,
6486380	6488380	but you can see the clouds above you,
6488380	6492380	soaring upwards, away from you.
6492380	6495380	Then you feel a sense of vertigo as you realize
6495380	6499380	that the floating island might not be as floating as it once was.
6499380	6500380	Uh-oh.
6500380	6503380	In fact, it's starting to fall from the sky.
6503380	6506380	Oh, shiz, but...
6506380	6509380	And what did we deduce about that portal last time,
6509380	6511380	like when we talked about running back into it,
6511380	6513380	there was shit flying out of it that was hurting us?
6513380	6515380	Well, yeah, it looked kind of like a painful portal,
6515380	6517380	like, because you remember the first time you went in,
6517380	6519380	it sucked you through, it hurt you.
6519380	6523380	And the final word was that it's not an option as an exit.
6523380	6527380	I don't know, I mean, I didn't say that, certainly.
6527380	6531380	I don't know how you guys came to whatever decisions you did last week.
6531380	6532380	Do any of us have tape head cleaner?
6532380	6534380	It might be easier to get back in that portal.
6534380	6536380	Get that portal widened out, yeah.
6540380	6542380	Just widen it up.
6543380	6546380	So we're trying to jump up into the portal?
6546380	6547380	No.
6547380	6548380	No.
6548380	6550380	Well, you're standing on this floating island that's on fire,
6550380	6553380	you're surrounding this angel guy who you've been fighting.
6553380	6554380	What, now we can kill him, right?
6554380	6558380	Can I pull out my flaming sword and attack this thing?
6558380	6559380	Yeah, yeah.
6560380	6561380	Oh, shit, I need dice.
6564380	6566380	Is this tape head cleaner thing real?
6566380	6567380	Yeah, yeah.
6567380	6570380	Yeah, it's, yeah, tape head cleaner, like, yeah.
6570380	6572380	When you were picking up the compressed air pickup,
6572380	6573380	some of that tape head cleaner.
6573380	6576380	Yeah, and also, I heard the same thing about able nitrate poppers,
6576380	6579380	that that's, like, that's part of the effect.
6579380	6581380	It gets you high, but it also makes your butt hole get bigger.
6581380	6582380	Is that right?
6582380	6583380	I don't know.
6583380	6585380	We have a Staples party, we'll all find out.
6585380	6588380	You were nodding vociferously when you said that.
6588380	6590380	Butters are a real triple threat.
6590380	6594380	But isn't that what Gary Oldman's doing in the professional?
6594380	6596380	So, when you watch that movie and he's like,
6596380	6598380	I love Mozart, whatever.
6598380	6601380	Is his butt hole, like, dilated?
6601380	6603380	He's just shitting his pants.
6603380	6607380	I think you're just more open to the world when your butt hole is dilated.
6607380	6610380	You're open to every, you're literally more open to the world.
6610380	6613380	Yeah, in every way.
6613380	6617380	Mozart, anything else you want to get in there?
6618380	6621380	I really want to try it now after all this talk.
6621380	6622380	Which is a C.
6622380	6624380	It's good old fun.
6624380	6629380	Okay, so I get off my flaming sword and I go right at it.
6629380	6634380	You go right at it, cleaving a hefty strike directly towards his torso,
6634380	6637380	but he neatly parries with his flaming shovel.
6637380	6640380	It seems he's not out of the fight just yet.
6640380	6644380	I think we should go into the portal.
6644380	6645380	Get out of here.
6645380	6646380	We accomplished our goals.
6646380	6647380	Yeah, you're right.
6647380	6650380	I don't want to overstate things, but we came here for a reason.
6650380	6651380	Paradise is falling.
6651380	6654380	And this guy, if we kill him,
6654380	6657380	he's got a Gagu in him that goes into the next guy.
6657380	6658380	All right, yeah.
6658380	6660380	I say we run for the fire exit.
6660380	6661380	Definitely.
6661380	6666380	Sometimes heroism looks identical to cowardice.
6667380	6670380	But running away from something always looks like cowardice.
6670380	6675380	Yeah, but if you run away long enough, you'll come back around the other side.
6675380	6677380	Let's run away from the fire.
6677380	6679380	Columbus ran from Europe.
6679380	6681380	Look what happened.
6683380	6685380	America happened.
6685380	6688380	I shouldn't have to spell this out.
6688380	6692380	So you look around for the portal, but it's not where you left it.
6692380	6693380	Shit.
6693380	6694380	You look up.
6694380	6697380	It seems it's maybe about 20 feet and falling fast.
6697380	6699380	Ah, fucking island's falling.
6699380	6702380	I tie...
6702380	6704380	Okay, I have 100 feet of rope, everybody.
6704380	6706380	100 feet of rope.
6706380	6708380	I'm going to tie the rope to my foot,
6708380	6712380	and then I'm going to use my boots of spry springing,
6712380	6715380	and I'm going to hop up into the portal,
6715380	6717380	leaving a rope behind for everybody to...
6717380	6718380	And all climb up.
6718380	6719380	Yeah.
6719380	6720380	Okay.
6720380	6721380	All right.
6721380	6722380	Hada!
6722380	6723380	Oi!
6723380	6725380	Using your boots of spry spring,
6725380	6728380	you spring spryly up towards the portal
6728380	6730380	and grasp its razor-sharp edge.
6730380	6736380	Your hands are sliced by the polygons of the portal's edge,
6736380	6738380	but you catch hold.
6738380	6739380	Blood drips into your eyes,
6739380	6741380	but you know you're going to be able to climb through this thing.
6741380	6743380	I'm a hero!
6749380	6754380	You pull yourself through into the ruined hideout
6754380	6756380	of the Seekers of Paradise.
6756380	6758380	That's where the portal came from.
6758380	6761380	You're safe with a rope on your foot.
6761380	6763380	Get to that rope, gentlemen!
6763380	6767380	The rope's being, you know, pulled by the falling...
6767380	6768380	But you get it!
6768380	6769380	Who wants to get it?
6769380	6770380	We all do.
6770380	6771380	Yeah.
6771380	6772380	Who goes first?
6772380	6777380	Well, as a tortured artist in this falling rock of paradise,
6777380	6779380	I kind of like the band in Titanic.
6779380	6781380	I feel like I should sing Lady in Red
6781380	6783380	as this thing falls to its death.
6783380	6784380	Yeah.
6784380	6785380	Instead of giving a good send-off.
6785380	6787380	But also go for the rope.
6787380	6788380	Well, yeah.
6788380	6789380	Okay, yeah.
6789380	6790380	Also the rope.
6790380	6791380	Just making sure.
6791380	6792380	You see me, it was cool.
6792380	6793380	Let me go last.
6793380	6796380	I can use my teleport cape to grab it
6796380	6797380	no matter how high it goes.
6797380	6800380	So you guys go before me.
6800380	6802380	I feel like I should mention that.
6802380	6803380	That's used up for the time.
6803380	6804380	Fuck you.
6804380	6809380	You're such a fucking dungeon master.
6809380	6812380	It's like I enforce some rules.
6812380	6813380	All right, fine.
6813380	6814380	I grab the rope.
6814380	6816380	I kick everyone out of the way.
6818380	6820380	You grab the rope first.
6820380	6822380	Happy Father's Day!
6822380	6826380	You guys continue to grab different parts of the rope.
6826380	6828380	I don't know why I'm describing that.
6828380	6831380	As you sing a soulful melody.
6832380	6833380	I do.
6833380	6836380	Lady in Red.
6836380	6837380	It's a great song.
6837380	6839380	You see the island fall away from you
6839380	6841380	as Yamichi looks up going,
6841380	6847380	and then he realizes he has wings and flies away.
6848380	6849380	Okay.
6849380	6850380	We don't care where he's going.
6850380	6853380	You guys are just hanging from a hole in the sky.
6853380	6854380	Can we crawl up it?
6854380	6855380	Yeah.
6855380	6856380	We climb up it.
6856380	6857380	All right.
6857380	6859380	We destroyed a whole island.
6859380	6860380	It's okay.
6860380	6862380	Don't think about the past.
6862380	6863380	I can't.
6863380	6865380	It's gone.
6865380	6868380	So yeah, you guys pull yourself up into this portal.
6868380	6870380	You each take some damage though.
6870380	6871380	It's okay.
6874380	6875380	All right.
6875380	6877380	Mulrain takes five.
6877380	6880380	Not Christoperberg, but Quark takes eight.
6880380	6882380	Christoperberg takes one and you take two.
6882380	6883380	Great.
6883380	6884380	Yeah.
6884380	6886380	Got off easy.
6886380	6888380	So you pull yourselves into the ruined.
6888380	6889380	The ruined.
6889380	6890380	What do you call it?
6890380	6891380	Hideout.
6891380	6892380	What did I call it?
6892380	6893380	Hideout.
6893380	6894380	Hideout of the Seekers of Paradise.
6894380	6895380	It looks like a bomb went off.
6895380	6896380	All the things.
6896380	6897380	There's furniture.
6897380	6898380	It's sheared in half.
6898380	6900380	Everything's just shattered and exploded.
6900380	6904380	And half the stuff that used to be in the room has just gone completely.
6904380	6906380	This is shitty in here.
6906380	6910380	The portal still stands though, just kind of like an open sore in the sky.
6910380	6915380	And there's nobody else in here except for us, right?
6915380	6921380	Well, you do see that, you know, scattered mutilated body parts of the gnomes that exploded
6921380	6923380	when you unleashed that portal.
6923380	6926380	I searched their bodies.
6926380	6927380	Jesus.
6927380	6930380	Listen, we're just being practical.
6930380	6932380	We should have been searching bodies all along.
6932380	6937380	I put pennies on their eyelids and look for letters to their parents.
6937380	6938380	No.
6938380	6944380	You see, there's a torso that seems to have a long dagger, a coin purse, as well as a
6944380	6947380	small sketch of a female gnome.
6947380	6951380	I take everything except for the sketch.
6951380	6955380	The other gnomes don't have anything or it's been removed from their body.
6955380	6956380	I want to take the sketch.
6956380	6957380	Okay.
6957380	6959380	I take the sketch and I make it into a necklace.
6959380	6963380	Because maybe later someone will be like, oh, I know her, you know.
6963380	6967380	Wait, do you do the necklace now or is it just you're going to make a necklace?
6967380	6968380	I'm very fast.
6968380	6969380	Yeah, okay.
6969380	6971380	You make a necklace of the sketch.
6971380	6974380	Can you describe the sketch a little bit?
6974380	6976380	It's pretty shitty, to be honest.
6976380	6979380	I mean, this guy was obviously no artist.
6979380	6985380	But the sentiment shows through, you know, we're obviously a gnome.
6985380	6993380	I got to tell you the truth, my OCD, I wanted to come in through the portal and say to anybody
6993380	6997380	who was waiting on the other side, do not go in there.
6997380	6999380	Do not go in there.
6999380	7000380	Right.
7000380	7001380	Like that?
7001380	7003380	And I couldn't, I was like, is there anyone else here?
7003380	7005380	Shit, you should have said it.
7005380	7006380	I didn't want to carry it around with me.
7006380	7007380	That would have been a great line.
7007380	7008380	So now it's done and just forget it.
7008380	7009380	But you know what?
7009380	7011380	We all appreciate the line.
7011380	7012380	Thank you.
7012380	7013380	We get the same joy from there.
7013380	7015380	Do the portal, come back in and do the bit.
7015380	7016380	Yeah.
7016380	7017380	No, but pretend we did.
7017380	7018380	We just got here.
7018380	7019380	Okay.
7019380	7020380	Now say it.
7020380	7021380	Do not go in there.
7021380	7022380	Oh.
7022380	7025380	Father's dead.
7025380	7028380	All right.
7028380	7034380	Well, we ought to get out of this building and get back to our lives.
7034380	7036380	We're just going home?
7036380	7042380	Well, I mean, this is the culmination of a big long campaign for us.
7042380	7046380	We finally got Kumail's character free of curses.
7046380	7048380	God, feels so good.
7048380	7051380	He has no dick still.
7051380	7053380	Didn't I get a better dick though?
7053380	7055380	You have a dragon dick in your bag.
7055380	7056380	True.
7056380	7062380	I didn't want to do it myself, but I think you should attach the dragon dick where your real dick would be.
7062380	7063380	Oh, most definitely.
7063380	7065380	I have your blessing.
7065380	7070380	I would like to attach the dragon dick on the stump of my former dick.
7070380	7072380	Like just yourself?
7072380	7074380	What do I have?
7074380	7077380	Well, I have some dick husbandry.
7077380	7078380	Yeah.
7078380	7080380	You can borrow a needle and thread.
7080380	7081380	May I?
7081380	7082380	That doesn't sound good.
7082380	7085380	You're probably going to gnome to do it, like a team of gnomes.
7085380	7086380	Yeah.
7086380	7088380	Bill Martigan's has a lot of cool gnomes.
7088380	7089380	Let's go look around.
7089380	7090380	We'll see if we can find someone.
7090380	7094380	Let's step outside this building into the daylight and stretch our arms.
7094380	7100380	And we hear the full lead sounds of wagons clipping and clapping.
7100380	7103380	It's like deadwood sound library stuff.
7103380	7106380	A lot of background chatter.
7106380	7109380	Whoa, damn, two gold pieces for that?
7109380	7114380	Get your coffins here.
7114380	7118380	And you find yourselves out front of a, what is it now?
7118380	7120380	Spizwad's weird bungalow.
7120380	7125380	The magical fellow from before, he got you to steal all those cigarettes.
7125380	7128380	I guess he didn't steal them, but you know, whatever.
7128380	7130380	He was going to help you magically.
7130380	7132380	He might be a guy.
7132380	7136380	Is he going to be upset because we just came out of a building with like gnome body parts in it?
7136380	7139380	We're not going to tell him.
7139380	7144380	I hide my picture.
7144380	7147380	Yeah, let's get our story straight about this.
7147380	7153380	We went to a secret gnome meeting where they play with buttons that open portals.
7153380	7156380	That's on them.
7156380	7162380	We were there when it happened, but we just leave out the parts where we did anything.
7162380	7166380	I mean, overall, what are we doing?
7166380	7168380	Do we have a mission for good?
7168380	7171380	Are we just always trying to save our own necks?
7171380	7172380	Jesus.
7172380	7175380	Wow, that is intense.
7175380	7179380	This world barely has plumbing, and you're asking questions like that.
7179380	7181380	I'm impressed.
7181380	7188380	I mean, I've seen a lot of shit on this trip, obviously.
7188380	7191380	I just imagine that you were petting my head, I guess.
7191380	7197380	This is one of those rare moments between campaigns where we, you know, we've finished our shit.
7197380	7201380	We're not beleaguered by anything else.
7201380	7203380	It's nice.
7203380	7204380	Yeah.
7204380	7206380	We've been through a lot together.
7206380	7214380	Can we all write down the scariest thing that's happened, the worst thing that's happened on this trip,
7214380	7225380	on a little piece of parchment, and just sit around a fire and talk about it and just throw it in the fire and let it go?
7225380	7227380	Yeah, I mean, do you want to build a fire now?
7227380	7230380	Yeah.
7230380	7237380	It seems like this is a good point to sort of end.
7237380	7240380	But, I mean, it's a little sleepy.
7240380	7247380	It is a little sleepy. There's no reason for anybody to tune back.
7247380	7252380	I pretend that I see a woman in a red cloak up the road.
7252380	7254380	Is that the lady?
7254380	7258380	It is the lady in red.
7258380	7261380	Monica!
7261380	7264380	Nope. Okay. All right.
7264380	7266380	All right.
7266380	7270380	I go into the nearest tavern.
7270380	7276380	You enter the nearest tavern, a place by the name of the Rusty Buckle.
7276380	7278380	What's that?
7278380	7279380	I follow him.
7279380	7280380	As do I.
7280380	7285380	You just see three gnomes and what looks like a baby standing around a table.
7285380	7287380	There's no one else in the room.
7287380	7290380	Is it an adult gnome that looks like a baby?
7290380	7293380	It just looks like a baby.
7293380	7294380	It's a baby gnome.
7294380	7298380	Fellas, I see your baby is standing.
7298380	7300380	Not standing.
7300380	7301380	No?
7301380	7303380	He's in a bassinet.
7303380	7304380	Yeah.
7304380	7305380	Okay. All right.
7305380	7306380	Does he need a drink?
7306380	7307380	What are you guys drinking?
7307380	7308380	What are you drinking?
7308380	7310380	We drink, you know.
7310380	7311380	Gnome.
7311380	7312380	Noors.
7312380	7313380	Gnome noors? All right.
7313380	7314380	Noors?
7314380	7315380	Yeah.
7315380	7318380	Do you want to have a naps blue ribbon?
7318380	7319380	Yeah.
7319380	7320380	They definitely do.
7320380	7323380	A round of noors for my gnome friends.
7323380	7326380	I'll get a nettle one.
7326380	7327380	On the shrub.
7327380	7328380	He gets it.
7328380	7331380	But yeah, so you get them around.
7331380	7333380	They're like, thanks.
7333380	7336380	We're going to go back to looking at our shit.
7336380	7338380	What are you guys looking at, your baby?
7338380	7341380	No, no, just the plans for him.
7341380	7343380	Are you going to plan for a baby?
7343380	7344380	I mean, yeah, yeah.
7344380	7345380	The baby's already there.
7345380	7346380	You don't need to plan it anymore.
7346380	7347380	Yeah.
7347380	7350380	The baby just didn't get here without planning now, did it?
7350380	7353380	So you're going over the plans for the baby that's here?
7353380	7354380	Yes.
7354380	7356380	Let me take a look at these.
7356380	7357380	Let me take a look at these.
7357380	7363380	It's a detailed, multi-layered blue print schematic that you don't even begin to understand.
7363380	7367380	But on the first page, you see something that looks like an eyeball.
7367380	7368380	I get this.
7368380	7370380	You guys make babies?
7370380	7371380	Yeah.
7372380	7374380	Wait, Clark, you're a gnome.
7374380	7376380	What was your plan when you were born?
7376380	7379380	I mean, I just came out.
7379380	7381380	I didn't really have a plan.
7381380	7382380	I don't get it.
7382380	7386380	Are these plans to make the baby or when the baby happens that the plan is for the baby's
7386380	7387380	life?
7387380	7388380	No, these are the plans to make this.
7388380	7390380	I mean, you guys keep calling it a baby.
7390380	7391380	I guess it looks like a baby.
7391380	7393380	It's more like a little automaton.
7393380	7397380	Oh, it's a cyborg baby.
7397380	7399380	What's a cyborg?
7400380	7401380	It's not like a golem.
7401380	7402380	Is it like an android?
7402380	7403380	Yeah.
7403380	7404380	It's like a golem.
7404380	7405380	What's an android?
7405380	7406380	It's like a golem.
7406380	7407380	It's like a golem.
7407380	7410380	Mr. Gnome, is there someone where I can buy one?
7410380	7411380	No, no.
7411380	7412380	You just got to make them.
7412380	7413380	Okay.
7413380	7414380	Could I get the recipe?
7414380	7417380	Well, we have these plans, but they're very costly.
7417380	7418380	How costly?
7418380	7420380	800 gold.
7420380	7424380	I think what we should do, and this is a crazy, crazy pitch.
7424380	7425380	I want to make a baby.
7425380	7430380	Let's take the baby golem and fucking run out of it.
7430380	7431380	I know.
7431380	7432380	I'm down.
7432380	7434380	Well, can we at least steal the plans?
7434380	7435380	Nah, come on, guys.
7435380	7436380	I want to make...
7436380	7438380	We're not saying this in front of these guys.
7438380	7441380	Can we talk over by the gnome equivalent of a jukebox?
7441380	7442380	Yes.
7442380	7446380	Look, I mean, I don't give a fuck what you say to me.
7446380	7448380	I'm going to steal those plans.
7448380	7450380	And I don't care what the fuck you're going to say to me.
7450380	7451380	I'm taking that baby.
7452380	7456380	Can I impress upon you guys that we've been through a lot this year?
7456380	7459380	How much better would it be?
7459380	7461380	Listen, imagine your life right now.
7461380	7463380	Now imagine it with a baby robot.
7466380	7468380	It's only better.
7468380	7470380	These gnomes, they helped us.
7470380	7472380	Yeah, yeah, yeah, literally.
7472380	7473380	We killed them already.
7473380	7474380	We're already...
7474380	7476380	Well, then what's a few more?
7477380	7479380	We're already here.
7479380	7480380	We're not killing them.
7480380	7482380	We're just taking their baby robot.
7483380	7486380	I'm sure we have 800 gold pieces between us.
7486380	7487380	You really don't.
7487380	7490380	I draw my bow, and I point it at the gnomes,
7490380	7493380	and I say, give me the plans, little ones.
7493380	7494380	What the fuck?
7495380	7497380	Give me the plans.
7497380	7499380	They slowly, like, hold their hands up,
7499380	7502380	like, just be careful, you know, get on the table.
7502380	7503380	Yeah, all right, all right.
7503380	7505380	I'm really sorry about this.
7505380	7508380	Quirk, grab the plans and grab the baby.
7508380	7509380	All right.
7509380	7510380	What the fuck?
7510380	7511380	Wait.
7511380	7512380	When did they...
7512380	7513380	I'm not fucking with them.
7513380	7515380	When you started playing Socio Pathfinder.
7517380	7518380	All right, that's enough.
7518380	7519380	That's going to end it.
7519380	7520380	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
7524380	7526380	Thanks for coming.
7526380	7529380	Thank you, Zach, on audio.

7559380	7561380	You've been waiting for it.
7561380	7562380	I don't know.
7562380	7563380	I mean, there's got to be a way.
7563380	7564380	I tweeted...
