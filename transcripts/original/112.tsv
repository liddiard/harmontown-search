0	19200	Hello, welcome to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California.
19200	25840	Hermit Town is now in session.
25840	32840	This song makes me happy and sad at the same time.
32840	38840	Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
38840	42840	Thank you.
42840	49720	Boy, I don't know.
49720	52480	When you started playing that, it was like, weird choice.
52480	57480	Well, I thought about it was either going to be Aladdin, or you got a friend in me, or that one.
57480	59480	And I thought this one was more sad.
59480	62480	Alright, you're meeting it head-on, is the idea.
62480	66480	Because that's how I first met him, and that makes me the happiest thing in the world.
66480	70480	Because Robin was, that's how I first knew him.
70480	73480	I grew up on, yeah, I mean, that is how I learned to be funny.
73480	81480	I remember being a little kid and imitating Robin Williams, like imitating Morke, like 10 years old.
81480	87480	My mom would take me to restaurants, and I would just be jumping around, making an ass of myself, trying to do an impression of him.
87480	93480	When Carvey was on, we talked about how in high school I would, you know, do my impression of his impressions.
93480	97480	My whole life I've been a hack.
97480	101480	Yeah, it definitely started with him, and we're all...
101480	104480	It was very cool to have him here.
105480	114480	The day he died, like Jonah, Camille, Pat, and Oswald, and a few other comic friends of ours, went to the rest again, and we sat down, and everybody had a Robin story.
114480	122480	And the stories were all about how he made you feel cool. He made you feel better for having met him, and...
122480	123480	That's for sure.
123480	136480	You know, and I don't think it would be fair, or I don't think it would be honest to not talk about the fact that he was so successful, and so regarded, and so mainstream, effective,
136480	150480	that the comedy community, I think, had to especially hang their head, because, and I'll say it if nobody else does, that there was a lot of shit we heaped on his career path over the time,
150480	154480	because it was just like an easy target, because he made so many people so happy.
154480	166480	And I mean, I think the thing about that is, is that no matter who you talk to, everybody would sometimes enjoy that it was like shooting a slingshot at the moon, you know?
166480	168480	I'm never going to hit it.
169480	178480	But everybody that ever met him, without exception, had a story about how joyful and...
178480	186480	Joyful is a dumb word. How sincere and how connected he was.
186480	194480	Yeah, he never... People would... I don't know. I mean, I didn't say anything about it when it happened.
194480	204480	It's... This is a doozy. And that's a really appropriate word to use. It's a doozy.
204480	213480	Well, the fact that we had him up here with Bobcat, and like, Bobcat is and was very close to him, and he's really hurt by it.
213480	218480	And we know a couple other people that were really close to Robin and are really affected by it.
218480	228480	And I'm not... You know, you and I used to joke about, we didn't like that movie, and we hated Good Will Hunting, and we didn't like this, and we would heap shit on him.
228480	238480	But also, having met him, you have to take it all back. And also, you find out that you loved everything you ever did.
238480	243480	For me, Popeye, he's fucking great in it. And that's the weirdest movie of all time.
244480	253480	Why is Robert Altman directing a movie about Popeye? And who did I meet that said... Fuck, who was it?
253480	261480	They said they had stories about meeting Robin, and he's like, we went to Malta to shoot that. Malta, an island in the middle of the Mediterranean.
261480	268480	And he's like, there's no coke there. And that was a point in my life when it was fueled by cocaine. Like, I had to have cocaine.
268480	279480	And so they couldn't get cocaine there. So all of a sudden, a bunch of Parisian models, like really sexy female Parisian models, started showing up to the island of Malta.
279480	287480	And all of a sudden, Robin Williams had coke. And it turns out that Popeye was made by vaged Parisian model coke.
288480	291480	Vaged?
291480	293480	Like, the models were stuff...
293480	294480	Oh, vaged.
294480	295480	Vaged.
295480	296480	Like pocketed.
296480	307480	Keistering, yeah. He had a bunch of sexy Parisian mules carrying the stuff. And I was like, it's a good movie. It's a fucking movie.
310480	314480	I don't want to live in a world where Robin Williams wasn't getting Parisian pussy coke.
314480	337480	It was an interesting time, too, for Twitter. I mean, there was, you know, we had to, it's not a single person from, you sometimes, I don't know, like a comedy icon dying, like you, there's corners of the comedy world that they didn't affect.
337480	353480	And this just wasn't the case. And that's why I kind of stayed silent because I had a weird effect happen to me where I, and this is all on me, this has nothing to do with, it's all on me because I didn't want it to be all on me, et cetera, et cetera.
353480	373480	Like a swirling irony of weird feelings that I didn't want to take part in some kind of polterization. It's not a real word. I just, it felt like we were, I was just reading too much about it and seeing too many people's feelings about it and all of a sudden felt like, oh, we're ready to accept this, which I wasn't.
373480	388480	I've never seen a death of a celebrity that people instantly wanted to make it about themselves instantly. But I think that, and that's not a bad thing. That's just saying that I don't think we've ever seen anybody die that people instantly felt they had a connection to.
388480	406480	And those are people that haven't met him that just people wanted to say, this is my relationship to this guy named Robin Williams. And I was born in the 70s, so I like him for this. I was born in the 90s, so I knew him as Aladdin. Some people know him as Peter Pan, which I thought was a terrible movie.
406480	428480	But people like, everyone had a connection to this guy because he was in a million things. I should have collected, but I didn't think, I didn't imagine we'd be able to talk about this. I wanted to kind of delicately kind of like, I also didn't think it would be honest to not talk about it, but I also kind of wanted to like scoot around it and like have it just kind of touch us.
428480	441480	But at the time, I wasn't thinking about curating things, but I think it's fascinating collecting the horrible, horrible ways that people mourn sometimes on Twitter. The things that they say, the ways that they...
441480	447480	His daughter said some nice thing and she got fucking waylaid by a bunch of assholes.
447480	472480	I got tweeted by a guy who was saying, hey, listen, man. This is like two days later. A guy said, hey, listen, community's great. You're great. I think you're doing a great job. I think you're a really, really talented person. Hashtag, however, didn't tell Robin.
472480	485480	And I was like, whoa. Okay. All right. Wait, I don't understand that. Yeah. Well, you got to let it sink in for a second. That's the thing about it. Like you go like, didn't tell Robin. What? Oh, okay.
485480	501480	Like people, people coping with it in different ways. People coping with their relationships with others through it. In our small little comedy world like Los Angeles, but also he did it all over the country and probably all over the world.
501480	515480	So many people I know that do improv shows, a small time, no one goes to him, like nothing improv shows or UCB, which people do go to. People have a story where Robin shows up and just wants to watch.
515480	524480	And then you say, well, you come on stage and he'll kind of balk at it where he'll get up there and he'll get up there on stage with people and makes everybody feel like the coolest person in the world.
524480	537480	And I think like, I feel very touched and honored. Like I met him when he came on Harmontown here, I had happened to have dinner with him two nights before and we sung songs and improvised stuff.
537480	546480	And he made me feel like, well, first of all, I felt like an audience member at the coolest show of all time because he was just doing this like command performance that nobody commanded.
546480	559480	And he stood up and my girlfriend was like Scottish and he just starts improvising Scottish songs. And so I had ukulele and some friends at guitars and he just started improvising folk songs.
559480	570480	And he did perfect Scottish accents, like perfect Glasgow and perfect Edinburgh. And we just like, we laughed so hard and he was sober at that time.
570480	574480	I got heat. We were all drinking wine, but he was sober as a barrel. And that was it.
574480	582480	The two nights later, I didn't know he was going to be here. Bobcat was here and Robin had happened to call Bobcats.
582480	586480	They had him going to Meltdown Comics to buy some comic books because they love comic books.
586480	593480	And Bobcat said, oh, well, I'm here. I'm going to do the show with my friends called Harmontown. Would you want to come on stage?
593480	604480	You know, he kind of balked. Dan didn't tell me about that. So I come out here, sit stage left, play a song and Dan makes a joke like, you guys don't deserve the show.
604480	612480	Bobcat goes away. Bobcat comes out and then he goes, Bobcat, fuck off. And then he says, and Bobcat leaves.
612480	621480	Robin Williams. I'm laughing and I go, Kobe Bryant. But Robin comes out and he hugged me because we had hung out.
621480	629480	And he made me feel like we had been best friends forever. Like he had a cool ability to make you feel really cool, really special.
629480	640480	And and I don't know him. I met him twice. But I kind of felt like I did. And it's I'm pretty I'm pretty proud of the fact that we had him here.
640480	645480	And it made me cry really fucking hard because I have friends that are really close to him.
646480	658480	Yeah. Aaron was really devastated by it. And I don't know. Everybody was just like, I didn't expect to be there. I wouldn't I wouldn't have expected to be devastated by that because I didn't feel very close to him.
658480	668480	I didn't know. I met him once. But also, I feel like it was a weird thing. And when I sat and Patton Oswalt showed up and we just sat down and he had some really everyone has really good stories.
668480	680480	He has better ones because he's met him more. And I said, I just don't feel like I was ready for him to not be around that. You know what? That's that's what it is.
680480	686480	I don't think anybody was ready for him to not get a weird thing to have. I think everybody thought that he was always going to be around.
687480	700480	20 more 30 more years. Like I think he was hitting a stride. It's like it's a weird thing to have subtracted from your existence because you didn't realize the value that he had.
700480	706480	Let's bring out Camille to everybody. Big applause and cheers.
717480	731480	Hello. I'm wiping tears and snot off my face right now. I'm just not sure about the Morgan Mindy theme as a choice. I don't know. I was I took a sounds. I took a lift here and I will tell you none of these people knew what that was.
731480	742480	Well, that's why that's why I chose friend in me, dude. I wasn't not friend in me. Yeah. Yeah. I wasn't friend like me. I wasn't trying to be a morose, but I thought I was taking a lift like, you know, the Uber kind of car here.
742480	754480	And I was sitting with a guy who actually has driven me to the show before. I said, oh, you're the guy that does that show. Stepnortz. I wish it was Stepnortz. Gore? Everland? His name is Neil.
755480	765480	I said, I said, I said, Neil, like, do you know this song? And I played the Morgan Mindy theme. And he goes, no, what's that? I go, this is the theme from Morgan Mindy goes, what's Morgan Mindy?
765480	778480	I said, it's a show that Robin Williams was in when I first met him in the 70s. That's how he was introduced to my universe. And I said, or this one. And I played you. Was it friend like me? Friend like me. Yeah. I played in that.
779480	792480	Yeah. And he goes, no, that's too sad. He said, he goes, no, that's how I know him. And for me also, when you hear his voice, I can play it for you right now. No, don't do it. No, I don't mean that in a bad. It is devastating.
792480	806480	I played it for myself. You go, oh, there's Robin doing a French guy doing an Italian guy doing this guy doing that guy. It's Robin pouring out all that shit. Yeah. I go, I'm going to play it because that makes me happy because that makes me feel like a kid.
806480	825480	But the Aladdin one, I thought would be worse. We, we did after meltdown, we played that one and it was like, oh, okay. This was a mistake. Like it was just very sad. I think part of the thing is that there is literally nobody else that I've been a fan of my entire life.
825480	837480	When I was a little kid, I love Popeye and that there's always, no matter how old you are, there's a Robin Williams movie that is like right for you. So I think that's part of it is like, you know, obviously, like Robert De Niro and all are amazing.
837480	853480	But when I was a kid, I didn't give a shit, but I gave a shit. Well, Robin Williams, like every day of my fucking life. I remember I saw this. My dad had this magazine. Popeye was my favorite cartoon. I convinced myself spinach tasted good because of Popeye. It doesn't. It tastes like shit.
853480	865480	Popeye was made by the spinach lobby. It animates your tattoos. Yeah. Yeah, I would like do that. One bicep would have a one battleship and it would shoot a missile at the other bicep. Yeah.
865480	878480	I and I, my dad had this magazine and it had Robin Williams as Popeye on the cover. And I was like, there's a fucking movie about Popeye. What the fuck, dad? First time I said fuck.
879480	890480	And then we tracked it down. This is so there's no, you know, it's hard to track down these movies and I watched it. You had to go to the Popeye district. Yeah, which is a dangerous part of town. Yeah.
890480	903480	Who played Bluto on that one? Brutus Bluto. Who played him in that? Jeremy Sisto. Because I remember thinking that that was the only character that didn't give me what I wanted.
903480	916480	I think it was Eisner. No, but I'm not sure you devolved. Shelly Devoe was born to play olive oil. I mean, I just caught up with the crane shot of the Popeye district in Pakistan.
916480	931480	When he established the Tom Clancy movie that starts there. I know. I'm sorry. I'm being offensive. I don't know. Say something about Islam in a format that everyone can. Dan Harmon, everybody. Dan, thanks for coming.
932480	947480	And it's got the Germanic, Germanic crane shot. The Chevy Chase voicemail. Chevy Chase doesn't have an army with the Tom Clancy Chiron, the pop Pakistan Popeye district. Yeah.
947480	953480	Like the green old computer font. Popeye district. Karachi.
959480	973480	But it's animated. Something like that. Camille, Camille, be honest. What did he just say? He said Popeye is our lord of things. Popeye is great.
974480	986480	Popeye Ho-Up Bar. I always wonder in the movies when they establish, they go like, you know, they establish an exotic location and then there's a guy in the distance going, it's the equivalent of a rooster going.
987480	999480	Like if you're in the Middle East in a movie, you just hear some guy going, he's freaking out. I always wonder what he's, what is he doing? What does he say? It's the call to prayer. It happens all over the Muslim world.
1000480	1012480	So it's like, it's like taps. No, it's taps. The call to prayer. No taps is a call to guy just done. Yeah. It's time for us to pray. It's time for us to pray. It's time for us to pray in the morning.
1015480	1028480	That's basically that it's called the Azzan is what it's called. And it is a call to prayer. And we hear it five times a day. And the first time you hear it is at five a.m. That's when you supposed to pray. So every night at five a.m. You hear that sound, which I'm not going to do.
1029480	1052480	Is it lyrics? It's a huge karaoke song. Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit longer than ever kneeling down. The ball bounces but it goes the other way. Kneeling down.
1052480	1081480	What is that? When you hear that and the guy, what is this? What do they say? Azzan? Yeah. You don't know. Because it's in Arabic and I don't speak Arabic, but it's basically like it's, I'm guessing it's like God is great. It's time to pray. Yeah. I mean, that's a safe bet. God is, God is amazing, but also kind of needy. So don't take him for granted. Yeah. Yeah. If God was your friend, you'd be like,
1082480	1111480	this guy's a dick. He's like, so how about I've been pretty good today, right? Yeah. You're going to be hearing this four more times today. Don't fucking. Yeah. Don't slouch. Yeah. You're hanging out and he's like, uh, time. Oh, okay. Sorry. You're great. Ralph. Now, Camille, speaking of lyrics to songs, Dan and I were out having a lunch today and we were at a bar and we heard some classic rock being played in the jukebox. Oh. And
1112480	1113480	you've heard of like, we, you know, we wrote lyrics to the night court theme song. I don't know that you're not familiar with that. No. Do you know the night court theme? No. So we, we wrote lyrics to that. Okay. And we also wrote this Pringles dick, chicken noodle dick. I've heard of Pringles for our songwriting. I've heard of Pringles dick, but I don't know the context of it. I do know. I love it. I wrote that one on the road with like the who's lying guys. And I wrote the, the
1142480	1172480	song about Pringles dick. I was holding a Pringles can near my dick. And Oh, I always thought it was the guy whose dick was as big as a Pringles can. It's not. It's just like, some people call me Pringles dick, but I never really found out why. Sing along if you know it. I don't really have a Pringles dick. I just keep my dick inside. I keep my dick inside a Pringles can because it keeps my penis safe and dry. Some people call me Pringles dick, but I
1172480	1202480	never really found out. No, I never found out. I never really found out why. It's a ballad of a guy who doesn't understand. So we should, that should be, that should replace the Muslim called a prayer Bible. So it would be Popeye district. Some people call me Pringles dick. Some people call me Pringles dick. Right. Come here. Okay.
1202480	1232480	You do a good impression of the call to prayer. He doesn't know the lyrics. You can do a better like, like impression of like, I'm not going to. It's not gonna, it's not, is that, I know. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna do it, but I do. I can't do it. Is it, is it, is it blasphemous to do an impression of it in a comedy show? Yeah. It's probably tacky. Yeah. That's right. How close was Dan? We don't have tacky. We have, uh, like praying.
1232480	1262480	And then everything else is blasphemy. Those are the two modes. This ain't praying. So Dan and I were at, we're at a bar and a classic rock song, which I think most of you wouldn't know came on and Dan started singing and it was about pooping in some, in some sand. So what did you guys change the lyrics to? We, we, we made a song called poopy sand. Um, I'm pretty sure we're going to fuck it up. I'm pretty proud of it. I think it's pretty good. You ready?
1262480	1281400	Dan? Yeah, I think so. All right. Let's try this out. I'm going to put the karaoke version of the song, but I think you'll know it. Song is called poopy sand. All right, Dan, you ready to go? Yeah. Yeah. I'm a little nervous. Me too. Also, if we don't get it right, we can do it again. Okay, here we go. You guys have lyrics on your phone.
1292480	1316320	The recipe was handed down to me by my old man.
1316320	1346120	It's basically a bucket with your poop inside and I had a handful of sand. Lord, I'm big. Poopy sand, you'll learn it. Wow. I don't want to be a naysayer, but it sounds more like
1346120	1374280	you're making sandy poop. It's more sandy poop than it is poopy sand. Poopy sand would be if you were shitting into sand. Camille, Camille, you weren't there, man. This is, this is a moment in time. Thank God. I would have fixed it. No, it's basically amazing. It's basically a bucket, which I poop inside, then I add a handful of sand. It's perfect. I'm just jealous. I wasn't there. He's making poopy sand.
1375200	1378040	Let's go to Harman Town in the news corner.
1378040	1401040	Sometimes, Harman Town's in the news. Sometimes, Harman Town's not in the news. Harman Town, news corner. Oh, you got a news article about a Harman Town.
1401040	1429520	Come on, pack it up. We're all high. It's not funny. It's not professional. It's a recipe handed down by his old man. He's just a guy selling sandy poop out of his van. There's a lot of supply, but no demand. I'm proud of the internal unconscious rhyme between recipe and basically, because he says it's a recipe that was handed to me and then it's basically a bucket. That's basically a
1429520	1456320	bucket that basically had recipes. All right, come on. Knock it off. I'm certain that Poopy Sand is a song that will, Dan, if you and I write three more songs, we have a record and then we can go on tour. I don't want to throw down any gauntlets, but I feel like it's better written than Rambling Man. Okay. I don't know if anyone's alive that will take offense to that, but if you are, bring it. I think there's like 19 Almond Brothers, one of them's alive.
1459520	1470520	Dan Harmon goes toe to toe with the remaining Almond Brother. It's like everyone be against me because it's like, they're vanishing. They're a vanishing people. It's not funny.
1470520	1488320	Were they brothers? I don't know. There's no way all of them are brothers. All right. They were all men. Thank you. Fucking Adam Goldberg, you son of a bitch. Who's in back there in the green room? Who's peeking over Spencer's shoulder? Who's that? Oh, that's Dave clock. He's the, he's not a wonderful artist. The artist for all of the meltdown.
1488320	1511120	Also Dave, if I'm not mistaken, you're the newest member of my clash of clans clan. All right. Come on guys. Keep the show on target. Good luck with your art. Are we done with poopy sang? I thought he was Jason Sudeikis. Pretty good. He looks more like Wade Randolph. He's wearing a specific hat. Okay.
1511120	1534320	Depending on what the news segment is, that song could be very inappropriate. What's the, what news are we talking? What are you thinking? This was the news. Oh, no, no, no. This is upbeat news. The, uh, Harvard town was reviewed by the LA times. Uh, uh, it was a, it was a critics pick the movie. The LA times is a movie.
1534320	1564280	No, no, no, no. Our show, this show. Oh, okay. Yeah. The show that you're on. And I, and I, and I, this show was reviewed. I selected a paragraph because we're all mentioned in it. And I thought it was pretty funny. I think he might've written it in a hurry. Um, don't review the review. Yeah. Well, I have to get those out every day. I just thought it was funny because it's like within one paragraph, he says a lot of funny stuff. Let's see it.
1564320	1590160	Uh, this is in the midst of this paragraph, which was, it was very flattering about Harman town, the LA times critics pick. He does surround himself with relatively more grounded compatriots, including most regularly co-host and comptroller, Jim Davis. Wow. The guy who created Garfield, you made Garfield? What's his name? What's the guy's name that reviewed this?
1590160	1616360	It'd be great if he was a comptroller, Jerry O'Connell. His name is Robert. Jerry passed on this. That's the reason why I have to come to him. But a semi-colon comedian, fiance Aaron McGathey, who has a po-cast of her own. A po-cast? Yeah. This feels terrible. Was he on the lamb? Is this LA times? And the half ubiquitous Kumail Vanjiani. I didn't know you were biracial.
1616360	1644560	What is? Half ubiquitous. What does that mean? I think you're kind of like approaching Seth Rogen territory. I think you think you're from ubiquitous then. Half ubiquitous. A ubiquitous then. It's like a half misogynist. That's weird. I kind of hate women. I'm half ubiquitous. I'm everywhere half the time. I'm 50% of everywhere.
1644560	1674160	Can I see this real quick? Is this really on the LA times website? He called me Jim Davis. We're in a fucking cunt. And Aaron has a po-cast. A po-cast? That's about those New Orleans sandwiches. Yeah, yeah. The modern media is not reacting well to the internet. They're like, what the fuck? What are the pressures rolling? They're rolling all the time, Lloyd. Go, go, go. I spilled coffee on myself. Half ubiquitous. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
1675160	1678920	I can't believe that the only name he got right was fucking Kumail Nanjiani.
1681360	1682880	Well, I am half ubiquitous.
1685040	1687240	Half the places he looked, he could find the right spelling.
1689640	1700120	It is amazing how often my name is misspelled, just because it's not a name that you see like, Oh, I got this. It's a name you have to look up. I would think it would never be misspelled. Because you're like, I gotta get this one, right? Yeah, I have.
1700120	1723040	Davis, Jim Davis, whatever. Those are common names. Don't fucking diminish me. No, no, I don't mean to. Fucking racist. I'm half racist. You're half ubiquitous. It's the end of my notes. Mine is one thing. I got an insider in the Uber community. My driver, Sergey, today told me I have 4.7 stars as a passenger.
1723040	1735760	I'll tell you if my driver at 4.7, I'll be like, No, give me a different one. Yeah, that's what I said. What the fuck did I do wrong? I feel like I have at least one of my Lyft drivers that came tonight. Is that true? Is someone here? Lyft driver?
1736480	1737680	Oh, we love you, Jim.
1740360	1752040	I met a guy last night who won an Emmy last night for doing the special effects for Game of Thrones. He said he was gonna be here. Is he here? Oh, yeah. No, he's not here. I guess. No, I'm joking. Is he? Are you here, Adam?
1752480	1764480	Oh, see, he came. He won an Emmy last night. Does he want to come up? I don't know. He won an Emmy last night. Do you want to come up? Get up here, Game of Thrones. You can come up if you want. We don't, we don't bully people.
1766640	1775800	I don't know how he can signify if he doesn't want to come up because it's just darkness back there. I think he's doing it by not coming up. I think I see him coming. He's riding a dragon here.
1775800	1780040	Well, he's riding a tennis ball and it'll be a dragon later.
1782680	1785240	Hey, hello. How are you?
1786240	1792720	I don't want an Emmy last night. Congratulations. It was the creative arts Emmy's last night. It was fucking hard to get across town.
1794680	1802560	You want, you want an Emmy for visual effects? Visual effects, yeah. For Game of Thrones? Game of Thrones. Holy smokes. What did you, what did you actually do on it? I'm the coordinator.
1803400	1807720	What did you like give us some specifics that we can remember visually?
1808560	1818280	Well, no, I manage all the different visual effects on the show. The dragons, all the environments. You draw? What? You draw? No, no, no, I just manage this. Are you the reason why there's so few dragons on Game of Thrones?
1819720	1825960	Oh, that's budgetary. Do you go to, do you have to go to, are you the guy that goes to set and makes sure the camera's locked down and, and
1825960	1840800	we have a data wranglers that do that, but data wranglers, but I, you know, I imagine ones and zeros and they've got a lasso. One zero. And we have a supervisors that go to set, but I manage all their times and where the green screens go.
1840840	1855600	What is, what is the, uh, the episodic budget for Game of Thrones? Because it seems like a show that couldn't possibly be a TV show because it looks amazing. It's a gigantic expenditure, right? I bet it's, oh, can you, are you allowed to say, I'm not allowed to say the budget, but you know, okay, here,
1855600	1872840	look at me, eight million an episode. Oh, he looked away when I said that it's way more than an episode. No, it's, it's more than eight million. Isn't it less? It's not 20 million an episode. I know that there's no such thing as a show that's eight million an episode.
1873960	1884800	It looks like a show that's $20 million in episodes. Like it's, well, but they do a good job of like making the big scenes bigger than the small scenes. You know, they balance it out. It's not like every scene as dragons flag around, you know,
1884920	1890960	they do a good job of mixing. What's the biggest money spender on that? Is it cast or is it digital stuff? Like, is it effects?
1891440	1898080	Um, and certainly matters on which cast, but you know, the dragons would be probably one of the most expensive part of the visual effects budget.
1899720	1914160	What about the, I don't know if I really answered the question there. Are any of the boobies fake? Like CG, you know, not like implants fake. No, I mean, like CG, you know, certainly clean up.
1914800	1919600	I think boobies are like, you get real boobies, it's cheaper than a dragon.
1920520	1922640	Wait, that's what's wrong with this country.
1928680	1930000	So how do you guys know each other?
1930040	1932360	I just met him last night at the Emmys.
1932400	1933320	Why were you there?
1933440	1934680	I presented an award.
1935040	1940320	I did last two years. They didn't invite me back. Because Yahoo is not a real network.
1940320	1944800	Joel McHale, I was a fucking star there, man.
1945200	1947320	They were like, we're not Aaron Nees, bring Harmon out here.
1947360	1950640	Dan, don't, don't, don't get fired off Yahoo this quickly.
1951600	1955560	No, I'm, I'm on Yahoo's side. I'm just saying, when are we going to get some props?
1955920	1957120	Bring me back to the shmimmies.
1957160	1960760	I was there two years ago when you presented and you guys were definitely the best presenters.
1960760	1962240	Thank you. What was your name?
1962800	1965680	All right. You hear that Emmys?
1966600	1969520	Yeah, only eclipsed only by the half ubiquitous.
1970240	1974960	If I am not presenting at next year's Creative Arts Emmys,
1975000	1982840	Adam is going to send a swarm of orange golf balls that will later become serpents.
1983560	1987640	Dan, you've many times called them the shmimmies.
1987640	1991760	Do you think that's, maybe they're like, they're a little fed up with that or?
1991760	1992640	No, come on.
1993840	1994640	All right, Adam.
1995480	1998120	If anybody else said that, we'd get an applause break.
1998960	2003840	Kathy Griffin coined that, I think, you know, everybody that's at the creative arts emmys
2003840	2008520	has a sort of self self-effacing like awareness of the fact that we've been pushed to the,
2008920	2011560	to the off the air of the primetime Emmys.
2011600	2013000	Semis, we like to call them.
2013000	2014240	Oh, the semis, see that.
2016480	2019480	Oh, but they look just like the real ones, right?
2019560	2020720	Certainly. Yeah. Yeah.
2021280	2022320	I held his Emmy.
2025560	2026920	I have one. I have one.
2026920	2028200	I held a semi.
2034280	2036080	And it didn't stay a semi for long.
2037120	2038720	Became a full prime day movie.
2040040	2040840	Became an Oscar.
2043280	2044520	And then back down to date.
2047080	2047880	Became a Tony.
2047880	2053000	I couldn't think it would become a Tony, like at its most rigid, it would become a Tony.
2054000	2057480	Adam, Adam, is that your passion, doing digital effects?
2057680	2060680	Yeah, I've been doing it for a few years now and I, I enjoy doing it.
2060920	2062320	What were you doing before that?
2063680	2068640	When I first graduated, I was a, I was a freelancer over at the Onion News Network.
2068760	2069240	Really?
2069960	2070880	Doing what? Writing?
2071080	2076080	Oh, no, just that I was a CEPPA when I first came out of college and then I moved to Los Angeles.
2076080	2078960	I got a gig at a visual effects house and I've been doing it ever since.
2079080	2079880	What's what's software?
2080480	2083640	Are you a software guy? Are you actually doing the, the, the, the, uh,
2083760	2084440	So he's coordinated.
2084440	2086120	Yeah, no, I just, I just manage all the work.
2086120	2087400	So you're not modeling or animating.
2087400	2087880	No, no.
2088560	2089880	Yeah, but you could do if you wanted to.
2090240	2091160	I wish I could.
2091960	2094120	What do you guys use? You guys use Maya?
2094760	2095920	You guys use Maya?
2095960	2097440	Are you guys using C++?
2097440	2098120	What's going on?
2098120	2100360	You guys, you guys use Lightwave?
2100360	2100720	Yeah.
2100720	2101560	Is it JavaScript?
2101560	2102200	Is it Avid?
2102840	2104200	Flash? Is it Flash?
2104200	2105560	You guys use Flash?
2106080	2107440	What if it was just basic?
2108320	2109160	Yeah, logo.
2111040	2112000	You use a plugin?
2112000	2114160	You guys, you guys do cookies.
2114160	2115720	I have cookies installed.
2115920	2118800	I heard the whole, the whole game of Thrones is all print shop.
2118920	2121520	The whole thing is nothing but print shop.
2121560	2122080	Wow.
2122640	2123600	What do you guys use?
2124320	2126200	Well, different vendors use different software.
2126200	2128560	So there's a Maya and Maya.
2128760	2129640	See, that's a Maya.
2129640	2130400	All right. Yeah.
2130920	2133640	They composite a Nuke and Nuke.
2134360	2135640	You know, you know what I miss?
2136360	2137400	Do you ever use Shake?
2138240	2139880	We don't really use Shake at ours now.
2139920	2142480	Well, now Apple bought it and phased it out, right?
2142520	2143680	Boy, Shake was great.
2144120	2144440	Yeah.
2144840	2146200	Are you compositors out there?
2147520	2148760	I just got a semi.
2150600	2151800	I really miss Shake.
2153040	2154440	But he came out to me last night.
2154440	2157000	That's the one with the little nodes or modules.
2157000	2157960	They all got nodes.
2158160	2158720	Nodes.
2158720	2159960	I mean, they don't all have nodes.
2160000	2161160	Maya's got nodes.
2161520	2162680	Nuke's got nodes.
2163040	2164440	Shake invented nodes.
2165160	2167880	I mean, Shake really brought nodes to a new node level.
2169360	2171200	Node based architecture is where it's at.
2171480	2171880	I am.
2171880	2173840	No, they just started this conversation.
2174720	2177080	If you could, you could, you could make a little GAGU.
2177320	2179880	You could say, I want this GAGU to bounce up and down.
2179880	2180160	I want it.
2180160	2183240	And that's a node like the transform and the y-axis.
2183240	2185800	And then you decide later, oh, I want him to also, while he's
2185800	2188680	bouncing up and down, I want him to move horizontally.
2188680	2189960	So then you add another node.
2190120	2192240	You could delete that node, turn it on, turn it off.
2192520	2194600	It's, you can, you can, you can improvise.
2194600	2197440	This podcast is also a subliminal weight loss, a tape.
2197600	2200680	You can, you can just play this at night and you lose weight.
2200720	2202080	What else do you guys want to ask Adam?
2202080	2204960	He came up to me last night holding an Emmy and he was like,
2204960	2206120	Hey, sorry, you're disturbing.
2206120	2208000	I was like, this is the best fucking icebreaker.
2208000	2209760	You could walk up to anybody holding an Emmy.
2210440	2212360	Like, Hey, can I cut to the front of this line?
2212400	2214040	At the back, you should take your Emmy there.
2214680	2215840	Is this your first Emmy?
2216280	2217000	Third, actually.
2220960	2221880	How many do you have?
2222320	2223200	He's the best.
2223240	2223960	I have one.
2225160	2226360	He has three times.
2227480	2231960	Mine's for best original lyrics or music in a comedy or variety show.
2233520	2236640	I was in a commercial that won a Clio, but that doesn't go to the actor.
2236640	2237880	It goes to the ad company.
2239640	2243960	You know, my, my, my genius move was in my acceptance speech for my Emmy.
2244400	2245640	I said I was ugly.
2246600	2250800	So at the governor's ball, all these celebrities, beautiful people were
2250800	2252720	coming up to me and going, I think you look great.
2253080	2255680	Oh, that's horrible.
2255680	2259240	An hour and a half of just random, beautiful people going like,
2259240	2260840	you're not so bad looking.
2261680	2262480	Thank you.
2262480	2263280	Thank you.
2263320	2264080	Thank you.
2264840	2267160	Did you also win the cover of Passie Aggressie?
2268280	2269640	Hey, man, they don't know the difference.
2269640	2271280	I'll face you for comp, please.
2272480	2274280	Do I look fatty in these jeansies?
2274960	2276560	Hey, you're only going to win one Emmy.
2276920	2279080	Like, make the fucking cake out of it.
2279880	2281040	And I think that's an expression.
2281800	2284960	So Adam, are you back on the next season of Game of Thrones?
2285040	2287840	Yeah, I fly back to Belfast where we shoot the show tomorrow.
2287880	2288320	Is that right?
2288320	2288840	Yep.
2288840	2290320	And how do you feel about this season?
2290320	2291080	Are you looking forward to it?
2291080	2292120	Is it good? What's happening?
2292120	2292760	What's going to happen?
2293760	2295120	I wish I could tell you it's not.
2295120	2296880	It's going to be a stop recording, Dustin.
2296880	2297640	You can tell us.
2298480	2302560	Adam, spoil the fuck out of this ruined Game of Thrones for everybody.
2304080	2306720	You really think he's going to tell you what's going to happen next season?
2306880	2307280	He could.
2307280	2308720	He couldn't say what the budget was.
2308720	2311840	Yeah, they will kill him with his Emmy.
2311840	2312840	They'll slit his throat.
2313400	2315440	They will send orange golf balls after him.
2315440	2315760	Yeah.
2316160	2316360	Why?
2316360	2321120	Why did they fire that one guy that was the blonde guy that likes Khaleesi?
2321320	2323000	Oh, he got into a movie.
2323000	2325920	And then all of a sudden there's a guy from Nashville that fucking took his place.
2325920	2327920	Yeah, he looks like a hipster, the guy that they replaced.
2327960	2328880	He just got a movie.
2328880	2331160	He's doing the transporter reboot.
2331160	2333680	Also, they're doing a transporter reboot.
2334440	2337000	All right, Adam, can you tell us why that guy had to take a hike?
2338000	2339000	No comment.
2339000	2340000	All right.
2340000	2342000	Oh, shit.
2343000	2345000	No, honestly, I don't really know to be.
2345000	2346000	I don't know that.
2346000	2347000	But you know, we're talking about.
2347000	2348000	Yes.
2348000	2349000	Yeah.
2349000	2351000	Have you have you hung out with Dinklage?
2351000	2352000	I have.
2352000	2353000	Yes.
2353000	2366000	And I don't mean to like sound insensitive, but the guy that left, he had what can only be described as he had rape face, which is not, you know, he just had like a weird.
2367000	2369000	He looked very aggressive.
2370000	2371000	That was his character, wasn't it?
2371000	2373000	That was kind of his character.
2373000	2374000	Yeah.
2374000	2376000	I mean, he was wall cast, I guess, but.
2376000	2378000	He was like a low rent Fabio.
2378000	2379000	I liked him.
2379000	2380000	Yeah.
2380000	2381000	He's the king of the rape faces.
2381000	2386000	But then all of a sudden he's replaced by the guy that's a producer that's also kind of rapey in Nashville.
2386000	2390000	But he looks like a hipster from like Silver Lake.
2390000	2391000	Yeah.
2391000	2392000	He does look like a hipster, the new guy.
2392000	2393000	All right.
2393000	2395000	Let's ask Adam something that he can answer.
2395000	2396000	All right.
2396000	2403000	Which actor on Game of Thrones is the least patient about having.
2403000	2404000	Call times.
2404000	2408000	Having to interact with things that aren't there.
2408000	2410000	I don't think I can answer that either.
2412000	2413000	Do you know the answer?
2413000	2414000	Do you have.
2414000	2415000	You don't have to say it, but it's in your head.
2415000	2418000	There's got to be somebody that's like, oh man.
2418000	2419000	You all know that person.
2419000	2421000	I'm sure you have that on community too.
2421000	2422000	Yes.
2422000	2423000	Yes, we do.
2424000	2425000	But Adam.
2425000	2426000	We knew who that was.
2426000	2427000	You paid his voicemail.
2427000	2428000	Adam.
2428000	2435000	Adam, is there one person that stands out as the least patient with the digital effects?
2435000	2436000	Yeah.
2436000	2440000	You don't have to say who it is, but is there one person you go, oh yeah.
2440000	2441000	That's the question.
2441000	2442000	He or she is.
2442000	2444000	But there is one, right?
2444000	2445000	Certainly, yes.
2445000	2446000	Yeah.
2447000	2454000	If we guessed the person and we were right, would you nod?
2455000	2458000	I'm just trying to figure out how you would guess that person.
2458000	2459000	Oh.
2459000	2461000	I'll go to IMDB and just go down the list.
2461000	2462000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2462000	2464000	Next, next, next.
2467000	2468000	All right.
2468000	2475000	Is it true that there is a second smaller wall north of the wall?
2477000	2479000	That should be a question for George RR Mark.
2479000	2482000	What are you finishing the new book?
2488000	2490000	Adam, are you a big fan of the books?
2490000	2491000	Or do you even care?
2491000	2493000	Or is this just like, you're just a gun for hire?
2493000	2494000	This is just a fuck off for you.
2494000	2496000	This is just a fuck off.
2496000	2497000	I started on a...
2497000	2500000	It's like you're working at a goddamn water park.
2501000	2502000	I started on season two.
2502000	2504000	So I was like, let me read book one.
2504000	2505000	And then I watched season one.
2505000	2506000	I knew what happened.
2506000	2507000	So I was like, let me read book two.
2507000	2509000	Is it true that Jon Snow knows nothing?
2510000	2511000	Absolutely nothing.
2511000	2512000	Okay.
2512000	2513000	Lena Headey.
2514000	2516000	She doesn't work in the Peter O'Fancillage.
2517000	2518000	Amelia Clark.
2518000	2520000	Sweet, sweet Amelia Clark.
2520000	2521000	Sweet, sweet.
2521000	2522000	Maisie Williams.
2522000	2523000	He nodded, that's the one.
2523000	2524000	He nodded.
2524000	2525000	Okay.
2525000	2526000	Got it.
2526000	2528000	Well, let's thank Adam for coming up.
2528000	2529000	Thank you, Adam.
2529000	2530000	And congratulate him on his Emmy.
2535000	2537000	Game of Thrones.
2541000	2545000	Lord, I am making Game of Thrones.
2547000	2550000	Trying to put your mama back digging up all your bones.
2551000	2554000	When I see Peter Dinklage,
2554000	2557000	you know I fucked your phone.
2558000	2559000	You know I fucked your phone?
2559000	2561000	You know I fucked your phone.
2561000	2562000	That's kind of triple, right?
2562000	2564000	When I see Peter Dinklage,
2564000	2567000	that's how you know I fucked your phone.
2567000	2570000	Yeah, Peter Dinklage, no.
2570000	2572000	I fucked your phone.
2577000	2579000	He loves fucking phones.
2580000	2586000	I just melted a bunch of swords for the throne.
2586000	2587000	All right, Dan?
2587000	2588000	What?
2588000	2589000	Bring Spencer out?
2589000	2590000	No.
2590000	2591000	Oh, no.
2591000	2595000	Game of Thrones freestyle to ramble it man, go.
2596000	2600000	Lord, I produce the Game of Thrones.
2600000	2601000	Mirror, mirror.
2601000	2605000	Calling up your mama on every single phone.
2606000	2611000	Telling her to get down here and fight those skeleton bones.
2612000	2615000	I'm producing Game of Thrones.
2615000	2616000	Camille, take it.
2616000	2618000	I can't do this.
2618000	2620000	I can't sing.
2624000	2626000	That's the only singing I know.
2626000	2627000	That guy ruins everything.
2628000	2631000	Whoa!
2637000	2641000	You'd rather blaspheme than improvise to a song.
2641000	2643000	What have I done?
2645000	2646000	Oh, no.
2646000	2648000	You were so against it earlier on.
2648000	2649000	Yeah.
2649000	2652000	You fucking panic and just sell out your heritage.
2652000	2654000	I've fought one myself.
2654000	2661000	Let's bring out the new George R. R. Martin, Spencer Crittenden.
2671000	2672000	Hey, guys.
2672000	2673000	Hello, Spencer.
2673000	2674000	It's Spencer.
2674000	2675000	It is.
2675000	2677000	What do you think about all that stuff?
2677000	2681000	All that, it was a great singing attempt by both of you.
2681000	2682000	Attempt?
2682000	2684000	Game of Thrones.
2684000	2685000	Good times.
2685000	2686000	All right.
2686000	2687000	George R. R. Martin.
2687000	2689000	No.
2689000	2690000	Not me.
2690000	2692000	Didn't you meet George R. Martin in Comic Con?
2692000	2696000	I stared at him from across.
2696000	2700000	We were, we were, we were, there's this hotel that wasn't our hotel,
2700000	2701000	but we were just hanging out at it.
2701000	2705000	We were hanging out in like the bar area that was outside.
2705000	2708000	There was, he was just drinking, what were they?
2708000	2709000	Pina Colada.
2709000	2711000	Pina Colada, that's the wine.
2711000	2712000	That's it?
2712000	2713000	Did I get that right?
2713000	2714000	Yeah, yeah.
2714000	2715000	That's what he was drinking.
2715000	2716000	He doesn't look like what I expected him to look like.
2716000	2717000	He looks like...
2717000	2718000	Really?
2718000	2720000	He looks like kind of like a Hemingway kind of character.
2720000	2722000	He looks like a sea captain.
2722000	2723000	Yeah.
2723000	2724000	I, I met him.
2724000	2725000	He was very nice.
2725000	2728000	And I was like, all right, steal yourself.
2728000	2731000	There's going to be, he's going to smell like the sea, but he did.
2731000	2735000	He was very, he smelled like a normal person.
2735000	2737000	And he was very nice.
2737000	2738000	The sea is a nice smell.
2738000	2740000	Yeah, the sea smells great.
2740000	2743000	I mean, they have like colognes named after the sea.
2743000	2744000	Like what?
2744000	2745000	Like the sea.
2745000	2746000	Ocean smell.
2746000	2747000	Ocean smell?
2747000	2749000	Scent of the sea.
2749000	2750000	Cool water.
2750000	2751000	Aqua.
2751000	2752000	Aqua.
2752000	2753000	Smell.
2753000	2754000	Smell.
2754000	2755000	Fish smell like awfulness.
2755000	2756000	Ocean sniff.
2756000	2757000	Yeah.
2757000	2758000	Pacifico.
2758000	2759000	Pacifico.
2759000	2762000	You expected him to smell like a fish or like this, like a salty breeze.
2762000	2764000	Some sort of more creature.
2764000	2766000	I don't know why, but like barnacles.
2766000	2769000	But he was very nice and he, he smelled great.
2769000	2775000	Not that I smelled him, but it wasn't like an obvious negative.
2775000	2778000	I'm sorry, Adam.
2778000	2783000	George RR Martin didn't smell.
2783000	2786000	Going on the podcast and saying it to who I tell.
2786000	2787000	Take it then.
2787000	2788000	That's too late.
2788000	2792000	I just did the bit.
2792000	2793000	It's not.
2793000	2795000	Pooping in your...
2795000	2806000	So our song was about a guy that sells poop and sand in a bucket out of the back of an
2806000	2807000	abandoned van.
2807000	2808000	That's a great song.
2808000	2812000	The Lord knows I got a big supply, but there ain't that much demand.
2812000	2815000	That's my favorite line.
2815000	2819700	He lives such a visceral existence that he poops in a bucket and thinks he can sell it
2819700	2820700	to people.
2820700	2823700	He's well versed in like a ninth grade level economics.
2823700	2825700	He knows supply and demand.
2825700	2831700	He's like, I know what my problem is in terms of what I learned in high school.
2831700	2833700	Supply is not the problem.
2833700	2835700	I just felt buckets every day.
2835700	2838700	I'm going to, sooner or later this bubble's going to burst.
2838700	2842700	Is the bucket, is the bucket, do they have to return?
2842700	2843700	No.
2843700	2846700	Do you have to return the bucket or is the bucket part of the deal?
2846700	2847700	That's what you're selling.
2847700	2849700	When you buy a bucket of poopy sand, that bucket is yours to keep.
2850700	2853700	Is it cheaper than just an empty bucket?
2853700	2854700	No.
2854700	2857700	It's more expensive to buy a bucket you have to keep.
2857700	2859700	I think it's just a little bit more expensive.
2859700	2863700	You're paying for the poop and the ratio of poop to sand in the bucket.
2863700	2864700	Yeah.
2864700	2869700	I mean, a lot of people in the bucket community have talked about this and they call it the
2869700	2874700	price of the bucket is the poop and the sand in it because you get to wash it out.
2874700	2875700	That's man hours.
2875700	2876700	Oh, okay.
2876700	2879700	It's a couple bucks more than a bucket.
2879700	2881700	Just a bucket, is a bucket.
2881700	2882700	You're better off buying a bucket.
2882700	2883700	If that's all you want, don't fuck around.
2883700	2884700	That's why this guy's going broke.
2884700	2886700	He lives in a van.
2886700	2889700	But it's a recipe passed down to him by his old man.
2889700	2890700	That's a heartbreaker.
2890700	2894700	He's just sticking with the family business.
2894700	2900700	If this country ran on heartstrings, then we'd all be millionaires.
2900700	2905700	Was his dad also a professional poopy sand maker or was just that his hobby?
2905700	2907700	Certainly it was a recipe that he perfected.
2907700	2910700	Right, but was he selling it?
2910700	2913700	Well, that's the third verse that we haven't written yet.
2913700	2914700	We don't know that.
2914700	2919700	I would presume that the father probably died broke selling poopy sand and the son said,
2919700	2927700	look, I have to live up to my father's dying wishes, which is to sell and perfect the manufacture
2927700	2931700	and the distribution of poopy sand buckets.
2931700	2936700	And the fact that he's selling it out of an abandoned van is that's sad to me because
2936700	2940700	he should be selling it from a roadside stand, which also rhymes.
2940700	2941700	And that's what's exciting to me.
2941700	2943700	He could have easily been selling it from a roadside stand.
2943700	2944700	It rhymes.
2944700	2946700	I should be at a roadside stand.
2946700	2947700	Roadside stand.
2947700	2948700	That's the third verse.
2948700	2949700	Yeah.
2949700	2952700	But all the glitters isn't gold and I'm doing the best I can.
2952700	2953700	He doesn't know.
2953700	2955700	He's just trying his hardest.
2955700	2961700	This new Walmart dominated economic sphere has got me on the lam.
2961700	2964700	I'm just selling poopy sand.
2964700	2968700	It's like what went wrong with our country is the message.
2968700	2975700	When a man can't go out and apply his father's trade.
2975700	2976700	Yeah.
2976700	2984700	Tradesmanship, the dying embers of a world where there was unions and there was pride
2984700	2987700	in the ownership of a small business.
2987700	2994700	And in the countries of this world, the powers that be, it originated from an axis that rotated
2994700	2997700	on the bond between a father and son.
2997700	3003700	But his problem is, even by himself, he oversaturated the market with poopy sand buckets
3003700	3006700	because he has tons of...
3006700	3007700	So much shit.
3007700	3009700	So much supply and there's just not the demand.
3009700	3012700	There used to be a higher demand for poopy sand buckets.
3012700	3018700	There's a whole bridge where it talks about how the ocean just keeps making more sand.
3018700	3020700	So he's the ocean for poop.
3020700	3021700	Yeah.
3021700	3022700	And it's like him in the ocean.
3022700	3028700	He regrets not becoming a fisherman because he has more of a...
3028700	3030700	It seems like the only...
3030700	3036700	Also, because sand, if I'm not mistaken, and I'm sure that I'm wrong, from a Richard Attenborough
3036700	3041700	documentary, that most sand is from fish pooping out the coral that they eat.
3041700	3046700	So they fish nibble on the coral and they poop sand, and that creates little islands.
3046700	3052700	This guy is just creating a cyclic circle of life.
3052700	3054700	I mean, this is beautiful.
3054700	3057700	What's he doing with the poopy sand he's not selling?
3057700	3059700	He's just... He has a...
3059700	3062700	Like yesterday's poopy sand. Is that a discount?
3062700	3064700	I think...
3064700	3067700	Is the van full of yesterday's?
3067700	3071700	Full disclosure, I'm pretty sure he's selling you yesterday's poopy sand.
3071700	3075700	I think that you're not always getting fresh poopy sand.
3075700	3078700	I'm picked up.
3078700	3080700	No, wait. No, no, no, no, no.
3080700	3083700	Wait.
3083700	3087700	Make it about Chinese murder vans. That was what I was going to do.
3087700	3090700	I missed the Chinese murder van thing.
3090700	3092700	You want to try?
3092700	3095700	No, no, no, no. We're done. It's okay.
3095700	3100700	It's okay. Let's move on.
3100700	3102700	Thanks, everybody.
3102700	3105700	All right, so...
3105700	3108700	We're sad. We're grieving.
3108700	3111700	We covered...
3111700	3115700	We're in the news, the LA Times.
3115700	3117700	Oh, you were also in a Forbes article.
3117700	3120700	Yeah, yeah, yeah. There was a Forbes article that quoted,
3120700	3125700	uh, I make a five stars.
3125700	3128700	But they didn't...
3128700	3130700	They just mentioned it.
3130700	3132700	Yeah, they just mentioned it. They were talking about Uber.
3132700	3134700	They're like, you know, and it's all over the media.
3134700	3136700	This guy had an opinion on it.
3136700	3138700	Also, this guy.
3138700	3140700	In his episode, I make a five stars.
3140700	3144700	And then they just moved out.
3144700	3147700	It's good to have efficacy. We should do something with it.
3147700	3150700	Everybody vote, uh...
3150700	3152700	No.
3152700	3155700	Everybody vote for no more voting!
3155700	3160700	If no more voting came up for a vote, then I would vote.
3160700	3162700	Nice.
3162700	3165700	But then what would you really do that Monday?
3165700	3168700	Yeah, we did it. We voted for no more voting.
3168700	3171700	And then you'd go out and your garbage would be...
3171700	3174700	Everybody would party for a while, then there'd be garbage piling up.
3174700	3177700	Who's going to collect this? And then the garbage man would be like,
3177700	3180700	I didn't get voted to pick up garbage.
3180700	3184700	It's not like you vote to get garbage people to collect your garbage.
3184700	3186700	That's a whole structure in place.
3186700	3189700	Nobody's going to yell at them or something.
3189700	3192700	No, you don't. They say that you do, but you fucking don't.
3192700	3194700	You think everybody would keep picking up the garbage?
3194700	3198700	It's the myth of efficacy, the idea that your vote matters a fucking iota.
3198700	3201700	If it did, it would fucking change things, which it cannot.
3201700	3204700	Voting is an absolute piece of malarkey.
3204700	3207700	You think they keep picking up the garbage automatically?
3207700	3211700	Boomi, and I understand that, but your vote means nothing. It never has.
3211700	3215700	It cannot. It will not. Your vote means nothing.
3215700	3217700	There isn't weird... I don't understand.
3217700	3221700	You might as well go to the booth and put poopy sand in there.
3221700	3223700	That would be more efficacious.
3223700	3227700	Isn't there a system well enough in place that we don't have to...
3227700	3229700	Deficacious, somebody said. Thank you.
3229700	3234700	We don't have to clamp down that hard on people who have a problem with it.
3234700	3242700	Isn't there enough momentum behind the cops having drones and tanks and everything?
3242700	3250700	Isn't everything steadily moving in a direction that people who would get worried about poor people rising up and killing everybody,
3250700	3255700	they can relax for a little while while the poor people can bitch and complain?
3256700	3258700	You don't need to squash it immediately.
3258700	3260700	With the shit in Ferguson, it's like...
3260700	3262700	It's happening tonight right now again, by the way.
3262700	3263700	It's happening right now.
3263700	3265700	Yeah, shit's escalating again.
3265700	3273700	I mean, I retweeted the number for the ACLU that somebody tweeted,
3273700	3279700	if you're being harassed by police while you're peacefully protesting, here's a number you can call.
3279700	3282700	Like, that's gonna make a big difference.
3282700	3285700	I retweeted a fucking phone number.
3285700	3290700	And still, with the Spock's and the fucking Asperger Republicans,
3290700	3294700	like, are you there? I'm hearing conflicting reports.
3294700	3300700	It's like, what fucking just side with the fucking people who are getting tear gassed,
3300700	3306700	now exaggerations, rumors, who gives a fuck if we're sloppy about going fuck the police?
3306700	3308700	We'll figure it out next week.
3308700	3313700	When tear gas starts flying, side with the fucking tear gassed, period.
3313700	3316700	You don't fucking side with the canisters.
3316700	3319700	You don't bother. They're canisters. They're protected.
3319700	3324700	They don't need your help. They have your fucking tax money.
3324700	3328700	They are funded by you. They don't need your help.
3328700	3332700	They have armor. They have the government. They have everything.
3332700	3335700	If there's a...
3335700	3341700	When I'm trying to protest, shooting a teenage black man,
3341700	3344700	Lord, I'm doing the best I can.
3344700	3351700	I just, just fucking, like, why, why can't it be common American courtesy?
3351700	3358700	I love that. No matter what, if you play that music, he has to make his point in that.
3358700	3365700	Why in this country that was founded by fucking brigands and rapscallions and fucking firebrands...
3365700	3367700	Fruits and mountain banks.
3367700	3371700	Why have we... I know the answer. It's because we're all terrified.
3371700	3375700	But how is that going to placate your terror?
3375700	3380700	And you journalists out there, in air quotes,
3380700	3385700	I hope that this maybe is a warning shot across the bow.
3385700	3389700	I saw some good journalism going on out there, cameras out in the street going,
3389700	3394700	oh shit, we're getting fucking shot at. They're grabbing our cameras and they're tearing them apart.
3394700	3397700	It's crazy. They're literally telling them to not film.
3397700	3398700	Unbelievable.
3398700	3402700	So here's an idea. Now can we emerge from this age of neo yellow journalism?
3402700	3405700	Because guess what? No matter how on their side you are,
3405700	3408700	they ain't ever going to be on your side when the chips are down.
3408700	3411700	They're going to tear your fucking cameras apart.
3411700	3414700	So be a fucking journalist, even in times of peace.
3414700	3417700	Because they're going to fuck you over as soon as they want to beat somebody.
3417700	3420700	They're going to fuck you over. Be a journalist.
3420700	3424700	It doesn't pay so much that you should be selling out your country.
3424700	3427700	Let's all get our heads out of our asses.
3427700	3433700	Why is it part of American culture to just go,
3433700	3441700	oh, this is that part of our national lifespan when the heart throbs,
3441700	3445700	there's a palpitation, there's a city somewhere where some shit gets fucked up.
3445700	3452700	Why isn't it common patriotic courtesy to side with the impoverished?
3452700	3455700	Right. It's crazy. Every good story is about the underdogs.
3455700	3459700	It's amazing to me. Do you watch Star Wars?
3459700	3462700	We took over the world based on the attractiveness of that story.
3462700	3466700	We didn't pitch the planet, hey, what have we ruled you?
3466700	3470700	We pitched them, hey, what if the huddled masses could yearn to be free?
3470700	3473700	We sold that pitch based on Star Wars.
3473700	3477700	We said, what if you could be broke and have a chance?
3477700	3482700	And it's fucking crazy to me when you see a quiet suburban neighborhood
3482700	3485700	with a house that looks like all the houses that we grew up in.
3485700	3487700	And it's really hard not to cry racism,
3487700	3491700	because really when you really boil down to it and you squint at the camera,
3491700	3495700	you squint at the screen and you go, if all these people were white,
3495700	3498700	would this be a fucking national scandal? Yes, it would.
3498700	3500700	I really feel that way.
3500700	3505700	I feel like there's too many black people on the screen
3505700	3509700	for people to not engage in their natural skepticism.
3509700	3511700	I'm like, oh, these guys are just...
3511700	3512700	Yeah, what are they doing?
3512700	3515700	You look at the live feed and there's comments under it,
3515700	3519700	it's streaming up and half of them are like, Michael Brown lived forever.
3519700	3520700	God bless you and all this stuff.
3520700	3523700	And then the other half are like people equally infuriated
3523700	3528700	that have no stake in it except like a strange xenophobia going like,
3528700	3531700	why don't you fucking people get a job and stop complaining for a second?
3531700	3533700	It's like weird dots that don't even need to be connected.
3533700	3537700	These are American citizens standing in a quiet suburban street
3537700	3540700	with fucking incendiary devices rolling down them,
3540700	3543700	smoke filling, surrounding their oak trees,
3543700	3548700	wafting past their bedroom windows where their children are sleeping in cribs.
3548700	3551700	Would you put up with that? Would you tolerate that?
3551700	3555700	What if it happened right here, right now? Would we tolerate this?
3555700	3558700	And we label these little cities and we go like, oh, here's an event.
3558700	3560700	This is an event that's going to begin and it's going to end
3560700	3562700	and there's an incident going on.
3562700	3565700	And we keep calling them incidents, but the police aren't calling them incidents
3565700	3569700	because the police don't rent tanks for the moment.
3569700	3573700	They acquire them gradually and they're equipped for this.
3573700	3577700	And more and more and more, every single police force
3577700	3580700	is getting more and more military equipment as we go.
3580700	3582700	And they're prepared for this stuff.
3582700	3586700	And it's not going to stop. The noose never loosens.
3586700	3588700	It keeps tightening.
3588700	3593700	So when you're looking at live footage of a city in your country
3593700	3597700	where people are being assaulted by the police,
3597700	3602700	side with them, you don't have to do anything other than that.
3602700	3608700	Just stop arguing about it. Stop waiting for more details.
3608700	3613700	Stop hoping that it's not that big a deal and just side with them.
3613700	3615700	You don't have to get in your car and drive down there.
3615700	3616700	We'll do that later.
3616700	3619700	But just stop fucking bitching about it against the people
3619700	3623700	who are getting hit in the head with fucking incendiary devices.
3623700	3626700	It's 9-11.
3626700	3632700	That ends our political corner.
3632700	3635700	That's just me talking to the two people that bitched at me
3635700	3638700	for retweeting the ACLU's number.
3638700	3641700	It's not a debate and it's not an argument.
3641700	3643700	It's fucking common courtesy.
3643700	3646700	When there's a fucking blackout or there's a tsunami,
3646700	3650700	there's a natural disaster, that's what a riot situation is.
3650700	3651700	It's a fucking natural disaster.
3651700	3653700	It's triggered by weird shit.
3653700	3656700	Then it's a fucking delicate, weird, crazy situation
3656700	3658700	where people can get hurt.
3658700	3665700	The fucking eyewitness reports,
3665700	3670700	the anecdotal shit that is coming in from that city
3670700	3672700	is deeply disturbing.
3672700	3677700	I'm 41 and it keeps getting closer and closer.
3677700	3681700	You know how comfortable these people are with this situation.
3681700	3685700	Do you realize that we are going to live in a world
3685700	3689700	where they are already prepared for it and we're not.
3689700	3693700	They're going to be driving down the streets in these fucking Humvees.
3693700	3695700	They're going to have their gas masks.
3695700	3699700	They're going to have their anti-personnel, anti-things
3699700	3701700	stomping all over the right to free assembly,
3701700	3703700	stomping all over the right to freedom of speech.
3703700	3706700	They're all geared up for it.
3706700	3708700	We're having fucking arguments about it
3708700	3710700	because we want more clicks or less clicks
3710700	3712700	or whatever the fuck we want to access.
3712700	3714700	We are not angry enough.
3714700	3715700	We are not outraged enough.
3715700	3716700	We're not hair-trigger enough.
3716700	3717700	We should be skeptical.
3717700	3721700	It's our patriotic duty to be skeptical of the people that control us.
3721700	3723700	Yeah, but that's absolutely illegal now.
3723700	3725700	Like, dissent is not something legal anymore.
3725700	3727700	It used to be, and theoretically it still is,
3727700	3729700	but dissent about the way...
3729700	3731700	What about this concept?
3731700	3732700	I'm sorry.
3732700	3735700	Being monitored by the authorities.
3735700	3738700	Remember that old adage about how if you're not guilty of something,
3738700	3740700	you have nothing to worry about?
3740700	3741700	Remember that old thing?
3741700	3744700	How the fuck doesn't that apply to the fucking people
3744700	3746700	that are out there enforcing the law?
3746700	3747700	Why the hell?
3747700	3749700	Why can we afford fucking drones
3749700	3751700	and we can't afford fucking cameras?
3751700	3753700	Put them on their hats, put them in their armpits.
3753700	3755700	I want cameras everywhere on these motherfuckers.
3755700	3756700	I'm paying them.
3756700	3758700	I know it's not a hard job.
3758700	3760700	It's not an easy job.
3760700	3762700	You are a hero and you're out there.
3762700	3767700	Those body cams and head cams are $900 or $950 a piece.
3767700	3769700	They could put them on, but cops won't put them on because...
3769700	3771700	Because it's an invasion of their privacy
3771700	3772700	and I don't blame them for feeling that way
3772700	3774700	because they're human beings.
3774700	3776700	Wait, what's your stand?
3776700	3777700	Well, I'm just...
3777700	3780700	I'm pointing out that if we should...
3780700	3785700	Why do we always start with criminals and pets and children
3785700	3787700	and we don't start with cops?
3787700	3790700	Because the cops need to do their job
3790700	3792700	and none of us can do our jobs when we're being surveilled.
3792700	3795700	None of us can be Americans when we're being surveilled.
3795700	3798700	So either all or fucking start with them.
3798700	3799700	I don't know.
3799700	3800700	That's my point, I guess.
3800700	3803700	Before there's a fucking camera on every goddamn instance
3803700	3806700	of every part of our private lives that can be used for or against us.
3806700	3807700	Start with cops.
3807700	3808700	Yeah.
3808700	3811700	Well, let's use that fund for that because...
3811700	3815700	I prefer disorder over organized order, which is a police state.
3815700	3816700	That would be chaos.
3816700	3819700	I'd rather things would be organically dealt with
3819700	3823700	than the fundamental idea that everything has to be completely controlled
3824700	3826700	from the police.
3826700	3829700	And if we're animals and we can't be contained,
3829700	3831700	then let's address that problem.
3831700	3836700	If you can't control a city, if the system isn't working at all,
3836700	3839700	then let's start having that conversation
3839700	3841700	because we keep downshifting into like,
3841700	3844700	well, these animals in this basin,
3844700	3846700	they're having a little bit of a tantrum.
3846700	3847700	They need to time out.
3847700	3849700	They need some tear gas.
3849700	3850700	How many of these...
3850700	3852700	How is this going to work?
3852700	3854700	I'll tell you how it's going to work.
3854700	3856700	The blinds are going to keep being blurred,
3856700	3860700	and there's just going to be dudes in bulletproof fucking SWAT gear,
3860700	3866700	paramilitary people patrolling every street that you're on.
3866700	3869700	And if you're not guilty of anything, you have nothing to worry about.
3869700	3872700	If they give police, the cynic in me says,
3872700	3875700	if you give the police these headcams and they have these things
3875700	3878700	that you can turn on when you go into a house
3878700	3881700	because there's a crime in progress or maybe...
3881700	3883700	I think a lot of those cameras are going to fall off.
3883700	3885700	I think a lot of them are going to be broken.
3885700	3888700	There's no way to control that.
3888700	3890700	Well, we're already in a culture of broken cameras, apparently.
3890700	3892700	A lot of cameras are getting broken in Ferguson.
3892700	3896700	There was a live stream today of the cops threatening a reporter,
3896700	3898700	threatening to shoot him, this video of it.
3898700	3901700	Cotton camera threatened to mace one reporter and shoot another.
3901700	3904700	This is tonight that's happening right now.
3904700	3910700	There's footage of cops ushering media away,
3910700	3913700	taking their equipment and destroying it.
3913700	3915700	I haven't actually seen it. Maybe I'm spreading it.
3915700	3917700	No, I saw a video. It's a smoke bomb comes.
3917700	3920700	The people run and the cops show up and turn all the cameras
3920700	3924700	to point them all down at the ground, which is illegal.
3924700	3926700	Yeah. It's amazing.
3926700	3928700	And also philosophically, why are you doing that?
3928700	3930700	It's illegal? I don't know that it is illegal.
3930700	3932700	Yeah, you can...
3932700	3935700	We know that it's fundamentally illegal,
3935700	3937700	but no one's going to fucking do anything about that.
3937700	3940700	You're a terrorist for ever flexing up back at a cop
3940700	3943700	and say, no, First Amendment rights and stuff like that.
3943700	3946700	The definition of what is legal, what is not legal
3946700	3950700	goes out the window the moment there's any sort of fur flying out in the air.
3950700	3953700	I just need to start from the ground up, like grassroots,
3953700	3955700	because none of us, we all have shit to do.
3955700	3957700	We should all go out and vote.
3957700	3958700	I understand.
3958700	3960700	Voting is going to fucking fix it.
3960700	3962700	Let's accept the fact.
3962700	3964700	Let's all go out and vote on freedom of speech.
3964700	3966700	Let's accept the fact that this is illegal.
3966700	3971700	The freedom of speech was free until they said it was fucking free.
3971700	3973700	Who is it? Is it Thomas Jefferson?
3973700	3976700	The moment that we say speech is free is the last time it was free.
3976700	3980700	Now it's going to be lawyers arguing about what includes free speech.
3980700	3982700	Can you yell fire in a public place? No, you can't.
3982700	3984700	So a circle is drawn around free speech.
3984700	3986700	It encloses and closes and closes.
3986700	3989700	There's nothing free. There's no fucking First Amendment.
3989700	3992700	And there's people that are fucking all fired up about the Second Amendment.
3992700	3995700	Fuck you. Fuck your guns. Fuck everything.
3995700	3998700	The first thing should be the ability for people to be, uh, to have liberty.
3998700	4002700	And I think that goes away all like every fucking single day.
4002700	4005700	And it's illegal to say anything anymore.
4005700	4007700	Dissent became illegal.
4007700	4008700	Here's the thing.
4008700	4010700	Like because we have political conversations,
4010700	4015700	they always come down to this point where 250 million people who have better shit to do
4015700	4018700	are faced with the choice between going out and doing a bunch of shit
4018700	4022700	that's a big inconvenience to them or going on with their normal lives.
4022700	4027700	Uh, like I think that a successful political movement can,
4027700	4034700	can actually be successful if all 250 million people just decide very casually.
4034700	4035700	To ignore everything.
4035700	4041700	To, to, to stop siding with the people with the guns.
4041700	4044700	When you next time you're talking about this with your wife,
4044700	4048700	with your husband, with your children at a party, uh, online,
4048700	4053700	just that Republican part of you, fucking let it go.
4053700	4056700	Because are you going to be rich? Is that what you're worried about?
4056700	4061700	Do you think that like if you sell out capitalism,
4061700	4066700	it's going to turn its back on you and you're not going to get to be a high roller?
4066700	4070700	Is that what's going on? You're, you're one scratch off away.
4070700	4074700	You're one promotional way from the myth of retirement.
4074700	4079700	There's such a thing as capitalism without fucking elitism and so much hierarchy.
4079700	4081700	You do not have to oppress people.
4081700	4084700	You do not have to worship people that have more money than you.
4084700	4088700	You can be at a party and if someone brings up a topic like this,
4088700	4094700	you can casually and coolly and smartly and widdly and funnily say,
4094700	4097700	whether all, and a lot of other made up adverbs.
4097700	4102700	Uh, I don't, all I know man is if there's a fucking dude and a tank,
4102700	4106700	I side with the dude, that's, that's all I know.
4106700	4111700	And if 250 million people feel that way, guess how that that is called democracy
4111700	4113700	and capitalism will take its course.
4113700	4117700	Like because there won't be any money in making people, uh,
4117700	4119700	uh, in playing to the other thing.
4119700	4121700	Like they've got us freaked out.
4121700	4124700	They may, they make us think that we need,
4124700	4128700	that we're going to be all rich one day and that we need to keep kissing ass
4128700	4133700	and clawing our way up and shitting on the people who dare to protest
4133700	4135700	and complain down below us.
4135700	4137700	That's, that's the, I think that's the key.
4137700	4141700	Like we don't have to fucking go out and wheat paste flyers and play red Rover
4141700	4145700	and, uh, you know, you get sprayed in the face with shit.
4145700	4148700	We, I, those people are heroes, but we don't, you, you can,
4148700	4151700	you can fight the fight at a fucking party hanging out,
4151700	4156700	smoking pot, playing video games, retweeting phone numbers.
4156700	4161700	The zeitgeist is if people put a thermometer in that turkey and it comes back,
4161700	4163700	oh shit, they don't like us very much.
4163700	4167700	Like there's the, I think, well, let's try that methodology first.
4167700	4168700	Change your attitude.
4168700	4169700	No one wants to take your money.
4169700	4171700	No one wants to take your fucking anything.
4171700	4174700	Everyone wants you to be American and free and love your family and have your
4174700	4176700	children and your Thanksgiving and all your shit.
4176700	4177700	There's no culture war.
4177700	4181700	There's no, no one's coming at you fucking the fuck you.
4181700	4183700	All right.
4183700	4185700	What do you, what do you think Spencer?
4185700	4187700	Um, it's all, it's all true.
4187700	4189700	Every single word.
4189700	4190700	It's all true.
4190700	4195700	I, well, I had a, I had a weird story life event that happened as kind of
4195700	4196700	relating to this.
4196700	4200700	I, I retweeted an article that posited that, uh, what was it?
4200700	4203700	Tear gas actually acts as a nerve agent.
4203700	4207700	Like, you know, it acts similarly to the nerve gas in that it directly stimulates
4207700	4211700	your nerves causing reaction rather than just like being a formal irritant.
4211700	4217700	And I retweeted it and someone, some, some old guy was like, huh, that's bullshit.
4217700	4218700	Stop spreading rumors.
4218700	4222700	And I was like, well, that's, that's a weirdly bold stance.
4222700	4224700	And I was like, you didn't read the article.
4224700	4225700	Did you?
4225700	4226700	He's like, I read the article.
4226700	4227700	It's all rumors.
4227700	4228700	Stop spreading them.
4228700	4230700	And I was like, who the fuck are you?
4230700	4231700	What are you talking about?
4231700	4233700	It's just some old guy with a weird military haircut.
4233700	4238700	And he's like, I've been an expert of chemical weapons for 21 years.
4238700	4240700	And, um, I was like, Oh, well fuck.
4240700	4241700	You seem like a bad guy.
4241700	4242700	Yeah.
4242700	4246700	And then so I started doing my research and I was like, okay, nerve gas.
4246700	4249700	It, uh, it, it stimulates the nerves.
4249700	4252700	So does it's, it's a nerve gas.
4252700	4253700	It's a nerve gas.
4253700	4255700	And, uh, I didn't know what to do because this guy's an expert.
4255700	4258700	And I'm obviously a guy who's retweeting links.
4258700	4263700	And then some, one of my followers or someone else retweets both of us and says,
4263700	4265700	Dan Kazeta is a fraud.
4265700	4266700	Don't trust him.
4266700	4271700	And he linked an MIT article that an MIT professor wrote that was like, Dan
4271700	4275700	Kazeta is active on Twitter and claims to be an expert, but in dealings with him,
4275700	4280700	I found his only, and it was just like this crazy paper debunking this asshole.
4280700	4283700	And I'm just sitting, like watching all this stuff happen.
4283700	4284700	Wait, which guy was Kazeta?
4284700	4288700	The guy who was this, this expert that was calling bullshit on the thing.
4288700	4290700	And I was just like, this is so weird.
4290700	4293700	I just wanted to, it's an interesting article.
4293700	4303700	I think you're allowed to be wrong and spread rumors and be irresponsible.
4303700	4305700	Also not the point, whether it's a nerve agent.
4305700	4311700	I think that, I think that like the responsibility starts and ends with the
4311700	4316700	fucking guns and the tear gas and the things and the people who are getting paid.
4316700	4319700	And if they show up with like tanks, people are going to have a negative reaction to that.
4319700	4322700	You can't show up looking like you're fucking.
4322700	4325700	And that is not time to meet the press.
4325700	4330700	That is not time to have a fucking Lincoln Douglas debate about whether or not your facts are in order.
4330700	4331700	Because guess what?
4331700	4333700	Your facts are going to be in order 48 hours from now.
4333700	4335700	Do you know what shit's going to happen?
4335700	4338700	It's just like, it's called folklore.
4338700	4341700	If a tank rolls down your street, guess what everybody gets to do?
4341700	4343700	They get to make shit up.
4343700	4345700	That's called our tank.
4345700	4346700	I don't know about that.
4346700	4349700	I fucking do know about it.
4349700	4354700	That is the only thing that's keeping them from rolling over us with tanks now.
4354700	4355700	It's lying about them.
4355700	4356700	PR.
4356700	4357700	Yeah.
4357700	4363700	PR is called us like getting to go, oh yeah, fucking, these guys are bad guys.
4363700	4364700	Like, oh, what do you mean bad guys?
4364700	4365700	Let's define the word bad.
4365700	4366700	Fuck that.
4366700	4367700	Fuck all of it.
4367700	4369700	It's a fucking tank, man.
4369700	4370700	Fuck that.
4370700	4371700	Exaggerate.
4371700	4372700	Lie.
4372700	4373700	Spread rumors.
4373700	4376700	Like, you're under attack.
4376700	4377700	Fuck off.
4378700	4380700	The truth is crazy enough.
4380700	4381700	On the guy too.
4381700	4382700	Yeah, Mike Brown, right?
4382700	4383700	Yeah.
4383700	4384700	He was shot six times.
4384700	4385700	Two in the head.
4385700	4387700	Twice in the head from a distance.
4387700	4388700	In the back.
4388700	4391700	Well, some of them were in the back.
4391700	4394700	All right.
4394700	4397700	We've covered a lot of ground in this podcast.
4397700	4401700	I'm biting my tongue because all my opinions are fucking unpalatable for everybody here.
4401700	4403700	I won't say shit.
4403700	4405700	I don't like any of it.
4406700	4407700	No, no.
4407700	4408700	No, you won't.
4408700	4409700	Because here's one.
4409700	4410700	I don't like Led Zeppelin.
4410700	4412700	So people won't like me.
4412700	4414700	Also, fuck all governments.
4414700	4415700	All of them.
4415700	4416700	They're all bullshit.
4416700	4418700	There's no such thing as a good one.
4418700	4420700	The only good government is no government.
4420700	4425700	And that people actually do have the ability to live without government and absolutely things
4425700	4427700	be absolutely orderly.
4427700	4432700	And the mythology that we have to have a structure of control.
4432700	4435700	You don't think you need a structure for any society?
4435700	4436700	No.
4436700	4437700	You certainly do.
4437700	4440700	A governing structure that does law and stuff like that?
4440700	4441700	Yeah.
4441700	4443700	But people can creatively do that on their own.
4443700	4445700	We don't have to be a bunch of people.
4445700	4446700	No.
4446700	4447700	There are societies that do horrible shit.
4447700	4450700	And if there wasn't government outside, they're killing widows when their husbands die.
4450700	4452700	You have to be very educated.
4452700	4454700	You have to spend a lot of years getting it together.
4454700	4457700	There have been times in history when people tried to do it.
4457700	4461700	But it's not going to happen, so we need government.
4461700	4462700	That's probably true.
4462700	4463700	And it's a very sad question.
4463700	4468700	Well, this cyclical concept, though, of the world's shitty, so it has to be shitty.
4468700	4470700	The world's shitty, so it has to be shitty.
4470700	4472700	The world's shitty, so it has to be shitty.
4472700	4474700	The idea of idealism...
4474700	4476700	That's happened as a good band with a shitty lead singer.
4476700	4477700	That's true.
4477700	4480700	You could need a brace on your leg because your leg hurts.
4480700	4484700	Because your leg is fucked up and you need to walk.
4484700	4487700	I'm glad somebody fucking is supporting that stance.
4487700	4488700	It's a bold stance.
4488700	4490700	I am anti-brace.
4491700	4495700	You have a right and almost a duty to look at that brace and go like,
4495700	4502700	this is a thing that is unnatural, that is here, that I need right now,
4502700	4507700	that I would like to not have if I can somehow figure out a way to not have it.
4507700	4509700	That's what government should be.
4509700	4511700	You should be able...
4511700	4514700	No one should ever be like, I love government.
4514700	4516700	That's insane.
4516700	4519700	And no one that works in government should ever be like, this is an honor.
4519700	4521700	No, it's not.
4521700	4523700	It should be blighted.
4523700	4525700	And a perfect world we wouldn't need any of you.
4525700	4528700	It should be like working at the post office.
4528700	4532700	The president should have poop for breakfast every day.
4532700	4534700	With a little scoop of sand.
4534700	4535700	Just a tiny scoop.
4535700	4538700	And he should be like, God damn it, I can't wait to be done being president.
4538700	4539700	I'm so good at it.
4539700	4542700	They really need me and I've got to keep the trains running out of time,
4542700	4544700	but fucking hey, it pays shit and it's fucking hard.
4544700	4547700	Celebrating is so weird when you become president.
4548700	4554700	The office of the presidency wasn't really that big of a deal for a lot of years.
4554700	4556700	It wasn't that big of a thing.
4556700	4563700	Now it's become this celebrity shit that now you're some sort of emperor.
4563700	4565700	It really isn't that big of a deal.
4565700	4568700	It's a functionary office and that's all that it should be.
4568700	4571700	And also it should be very fucking temporary.
4571700	4574700	And also the people shouldn't give two shits about it.
4574700	4579700	The best politician that wins every election is nobody.
4579700	4580700	Because most people don't fucking vote.
4580700	4581700	Why?
4581700	4582700	It doesn't matter.
4582700	4586700	The idea that Democrats and Republicans are all that different lies.
4586700	4589700	The same fucking party.
4589700	4592700	The idea that we have a left and a right in our democracy.
4592700	4593700	We do not.
4593700	4595700	There are two sides that are pretty left.
4595700	4597700	I'm sorry, pretty right.
4597700	4599700	And they're getting farther and farther right.
4600700	4604700	George Herbert Walker Bush would be a lefty compared to what's going on now.
4604700	4609700	The idea that when you vote for Obama versus so and so or whatever the fuck.
4609700	4612700	The idea that there's one side versus another side.
4612700	4614700	There's two giant differences between them.
4614700	4616700	It's absolutely insanity.
4616700	4617700	It diminishes our intellect.
4617700	4619700	It diminishes the democracy.
4619700	4622700	Our Constitution has basically been turned to shit.
4622700	4624700	Also it's frequently shit.
4624700	4628700	And when the tanks roll in you're going to feel like a bad person for saying fuck you tanks.
4628700	4630700	Because the tanks will have American flags on them.
4630700	4632700	And we'll be a bad person.
4632700	4636700	Not only will we be shot at but we'll also just feel like bad Americans for it.
4636700	4643700	As good Americans you should have absolutely a horror government at all times.
4643700	4645700	There should be a revolution all the fucking time.
4645700	4651700	And we cannot do it because we're too stupid to actually get up in the morning and take care of our elderly.
4651700	4652700	To teach our children.
4652700	4655700	To pave a fucking road without letting other people do it.
4655700	4656700	We don't know how to do it.
4656700	4657700	We've been taught not to do it.
4657700	4658700	Well we're too happy.
4658700	4661700	The cartoons are too good and video games are too fun.
4661700	4662700	Is America a bad country?
4662700	4663700	No.
4663700	4665700	America is one of the best shitty places in the world.
4665700	4666700	It's fantastic.
4666700	4668700	We get along quite well here.
4668700	4670700	The Wi-Fi is pretty bad.
4670700	4676700	But also we don't get to really wave a flag and say that we are what we think we are.
4676700	4679700	Because the world lists the American flag and a lot of parts of the world I think.
4679700	4682700	And runs for fucking cover because there's fucking drones attacking them.
4682700	4684700	And we torture people.
4684700	4686700	We do everything that we don't believe in.
4686700	4688700	And we're not good guys.
4688700	4690700	We're not heroes anymore.
4690700	4692700	We haven't been for a good long time.
4692700	4694700	Actually I don't know that we ever fucking were.
4694700	4697700	We had slavery forever and thought that was quite all right.
4697700	4702700	We're still the misogynist and fucking racist fucking bunch of people that can move around.
4702700	4704700	There's worse countries than ours.
4704700	4706700	I'm not saying it's the worst place in the world.
4706700	4709700	But we can't wave a banner and say that we're doing it all right.
4709700	4710700	We're not doing it all right.
4710700	4712700	I think we can but we have to keep striving.
4712700	4713700	Yeah but we don't strive anymore.
4713700	4716700	We don't strive anymore because we think we fucking already crossed the finish line.
4716700	4718700	I think we're allowed to brag about everything we've done.
4718700	4722700	But we have to keep on competing with somebody other than earlier.
4722700	4723700	I agree with that.
4723700	4725700	I'm not saying that it's the worst country in the world.
4725700	4726700	That it's bad.
4726700	4728700	But it's the most apathetic I think.
4728700	4731700	The populace is the most apathetic.
4731700	4734700	I don't like the hypocrisy of saying that we actually do love liberty.
4734700	4736700	And that we do love freedom.
4736700	4737700	Because we don't.
4737700	4746700	We're quite willing to make cupcakes.
4746700	4753700	We're quite willing to limit our own democracy and limit freedom.
4753700	4755700	I fucking hate governments.
4755700	4756700	I fucking hate them all.
4756700	4757700	I hate Led Zeppelin.
4757700	4758700	All right.
4758700	4759700	Led Zeppelin and governments.
4759700	4761700	Omerated.
4761700	4763700	Also Snowpiercer is a bad movie.
4763700	4764700	Fuck Snowpiercer.
4764700	4769700	My favorite line from that movie.
4769700	4770700	It's a bad movie.
4770700	4772700	It's a fucking awesome movie.
4772700	4773700	You know what?
4773700	4774700	Apocalypse Now.
4774700	4775700	Not that great.
4775700	4776700	It's no.
4776700	4777700	I agree.
4777700	4778700	Apocalypse Now is too fucking long.
4778700	4780700	An unfair treatment of Vietnam.
4780700	4781700	All right.
4781700	4782700	All right.
4782700	4783700	All right.
4783700	4784700	What else?
4784700	4785700	E.T.
4785700	4786700	Third act problems.
4786700	4787700	Fuck you.
4787700	4788700	Goonies.
4788700	4791700	Doesn't hold up.
4792700	4793700	Yeah.
4793700	4795700	Oh, shit.
4795700	4796700	Yeah.
4796700	4797700	It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
4797700	4800700	Go watch Goonies again.
4800700	4801700	Yeah.
4801700	4802700	There's nothing sacred.
4802700	4803700	Also.
4803700	4804700	Governments.
4804700	4805700	Goonies.
4805700	4806700	I was sad for me.
4806700	4808700	Real genius did not live up to my remembrance of it.
4808700	4809700	Really?
4809700	4810700	It's not that good anymore.
4810700	4811700	Watch it again.
4811700	4812700	It's pretty.
4812700	4813700	It's not that great.
4813700	4814700	Watch it again.
4814700	4815700	Watch your government again.
4815700	4817700	You're the Goonies of governments.
4817700	4819700	Also, am I right about everything?
4819700	4820700	No.
4820700	4821700	I love words.
4821700	4822700	Do I say every word right?
4822700	4823700	No.
4823700	4825700	And so there's going to be people that are going to hate everything I say.
4825700	4826700	Let's all go have a drink.
4826700	4827700	Sit around and talk about it.
4827700	4828700	I will convince you of two things.
4828700	4831700	Rush sucks and voting is gay.
4831700	4835700	Also, saying voting is gay doesn't make me a homophobe.
4835700	4839700	It makes me wish I hadn't said voting is gay.
4839700	4843700	Because I undercut everything I just fucking said.
4843700	4844700	Yeah.
4844700	4845700	That would be great at the end.
4845700	4847700	And then, you know, black people can vote now.
4847700	4848700	So that's weird.
4848700	4849700	What?
4849700	4851700	Also, yeah, we've been too soft on Asians.
4851700	4853700	I fucking think Asians are getting a fucking...
4853700	4855700	They're getting a free ride.
4855700	4860700	Jeff Davis would have you believe that voting is gay.
4860700	4862700	But he thinks Asians are all right.
4862700	4867700	Jeff Davis hates gays soft on Asians.
4867700	4869700	Paid for by Dan Harmon.
4869700	4871700	I was making fun of myself when I said that.
4871700	4873700	But voting is stupid.
4873700	4876700	Being gay is fucking great.
4876700	4880700	I think I'll suck anybody's dick after the show.
4880700	4881700	If you vote for it.
4881700	4882700	If you all fucking...
4882700	4886700	If there's a fucking plurality, I will suck a dick.
4888700	4889700	My name is Jim Davis.
4889700	4891700	I'll see you after the show.
4891700	4893700	I think all gay people worth their salt
4893700	4895700	can handle the occasional slip-up.
4895700	4896700	I know.
4896700	4898700	Especially when it's got the red handkerchief
4898700	4901700	on the 2x4 of, like, oops, sorry about that.
4901700	4904700	I think that's actually better than not saying any more.
4904700	4908700	Also, I sat her in silence because I hate talking about it
4908700	4909700	because what I believe...
4909700	4911700	I don't even know how to support it.
4911700	4914700	I used to believe in, like, what...
4914700	4917700	Emma Goldman, Mikael Bakunin, Kropotkin,
4917700	4919700	and the great anarchist thinkers,
4919700	4922700	that the idea that anarchism is the mother of order.
4922700	4923700	It's not disorder.
4923700	4925700	The idea that we have to be led around
4925700	4927700	by people that we don't know anything about
4927700	4929700	and these fake structures and shit like that.
4929700	4931700	When I start talking about that, I bore myself senseless
4931700	4933700	because I don't really know how to support it.
4933700	4935700	And then I say something stupid, like, voting is gay,
4935700	4936700	which undercuts everything,
4936700	4938700	and people are gonna have a fucking field day on that.
4938700	4939700	To which I say, hooray, you should,
4939700	4941700	because I'm a fucking moron.
4941700	4943700	Also, I just don't like government.
4943700	4945700	Well, this is the thing that drives me nuts about politics,
4945700	4946700	is that there's no...
4946700	4948700	Idealism has no...
4948700	4950700	We treat idealism the same way
4950700	4954700	that we treat everything else that's actually already going on.
4954700	4956700	That, I have a big problem with.
4956700	4960700	I think that you need to be able to stand at a party and say,
4960700	4963700	I think everybody should be naked.
4963700	4965700	And it shouldn't be held to the same scrutiny.
4965700	4967700	It's like, well, if everyone was naked,
4967700	4969700	then there wouldn't be pants, and if there were no pants...
4969700	4971700	Okay, so let's never think about anything.
4971700	4975700	It's really important to soak ourselves in idealism.
4975700	4978700	It's not all gonna take.
4978700	4981700	But the shit that's already working, it's working.
4981700	4984700	And it's working too well, and it ain't working good enough.
4984700	4987700	And we need to constantly be soaking
4987700	4989700	in a solution of idealism.
4989700	4991700	We need to have crazy people saying,
4991700	4993700	what if we were communists?
4993700	4994700	What if we were naked?
4994700	4996700	What if there was no government?
4996700	4998700	What if garbage was food?
4998700	5001700	What if you could turn salt water into fresh water?
5001700	5003700	What if sand was poopy?
5003700	5004700	What if we weren't dependent on oil?
5004700	5007700	What if the fucking planet is slowly heating up,
5007700	5008700	and it's our fault?
5008700	5010700	You need to constantly have people...
5010700	5013700	If you constantly put everything that those people say
5013700	5016700	under a microscope and bash them to pieces,
5016700	5019700	if it doesn't hold up to the same things
5019700	5021700	that have the status quo behind them,
5021700	5023700	then we're definitely fucked.
5023700	5024700	That's called stagnation.
5024700	5027700	That's called a tree that doesn't bend.
5027700	5029700	It's going to break and uproot
5029700	5031700	and float down the Amazon River.
5031700	5034700	All right, let's...
5034700	5035700	So...
5035700	5036700	Look at...
5036700	5039700	I'll stare at me, I guess.
5039700	5040700	That's what let's do.
5040700	5042700	You got any D&D in store for us?
5042700	5044700	Oh, do I?
5045700	5046700	Yes.
5051700	5052700	I wish voting were more gay.
5052700	5054700	I guess that's my problem.
5054700	5055700	Voting is too straight.
5055700	5056700	Nobody is really offended by that.
5056700	5058700	I think you're being too hard at yourself.
5058700	5059700	I'm paranoid.
5059700	5060700	You're being too hard on yourself.
5060700	5062700	You just spoke something and you regretted it.
5062700	5064700	There's certain things that we've been saying our whole lives
5064700	5065700	that are now...
5065700	5067700	We realize, not the right thing to say,
5067700	5068700	I think correctly,
5068700	5070700	and so sometimes you fall back on old patterns,
5070700	5072700	but you caught yourself and that's all that matters.
5073700	5076700	No, the fear is that people continue to not think about it
5076700	5077700	and then just go,
5077700	5078700	oh, that thing's gay and that thing's gay.
5078700	5079700	Right.
5079700	5080700	Exactly.
5080700	5082700	You considered what you said and realized that, you know...
5082700	5083700	That was foolish of me.
5083700	5084700	What you said was gay.
5084700	5085700	But also, like...
5086700	5087700	No, no.
5087700	5088700	What I said...
5088700	5089700	What have I done?
5089700	5090700	What I said was retarded, Camille.
5090700	5092700	It was totally retarded.
5093700	5095700	My sister's retarded.
5096700	5097700	Is she?
5097700	5098700	Yep.
5098700	5100700	To beat the band.
5100700	5101700	What did you say?
5103700	5104700	To beat the band?
5105700	5106700	Beat the band?
5106700	5107700	Beat the band.
5107700	5109700	She's retarded to beat the band.
5109700	5110700	What does that mean?
5110700	5111700	No, what does that mean?
5111700	5112700	She's really retarded.
5113700	5115700	Beat the band means really retarded?
5115700	5116700	To beat the band.
5116700	5117700	Yeah.
5117700	5118700	Oh, man.
5118700	5119700	Oh, fuck.
5119700	5120700	Ice cream.
5120700	5121700	That was delicious.
5121700	5123700	I need that to beat the band.
5123700	5125700	Explain it to me.
5126700	5128700	You subbed the band.
5128700	5130700	When you used to have quiz bands and then...
5130700	5131700	No, Adam.
5132700	5133700	Tell me what it means.
5133700	5135700	Singing loud enough to beat the band.
5135700	5136700	Oh, singing.
5136700	5137700	Singing to beat the band.
5137700	5139700	He was yelling to beat the band.
5139700	5141700	Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
5141700	5142700	Like out shouting the...
5142700	5143700	Be forcefully.
5144700	5145700	That makes sense.
5145700	5148700	You know, I just found out that hoisted by your own petard.
5148700	5149700	Love it.
5149700	5150700	41 years old.
5150700	5151700	I've used that expression a million times.
5151700	5156700	I always pictured a petard as a special fancy kind of pants.
5157700	5160700	And that being hoisted by your own petard meant that your pants were so fancy that it made it easy.
5161700	5165700	For, like, people to, like, lift you up and, like, dangle you.
5165700	5168700	I always pictured, like, a fancy guy in a pirate ship going, like,
5168700	5172700	you pirates are gonna have to get a new way of doing things.
5172700	5173700	I'm Mr. Fancy Pants.
5173700	5174700	I'm wearing a petard.
5174700	5177700	From now on, no blank walking, and I'll tell you why.
5177700	5179700	And then the pirates go, like, are you seeing what I'm seeing?
5179700	5182700	Yeah, his petard has, like, a huge loop on it.
5182700	5183700	Paddle, yeah.
5183700	5185700	Let's put the thing, and then they hoist him up, and he's like,
5185700	5188700	whoa, and another thing, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
5188700	5190700	I always thought that's what hoisted by your own petard meant.
5190700	5191700	Hoisted by your own petard meant.
5191700	5192700	It means a grenade.
5192700	5194700	A petard is a bomb.
5194700	5196700	Hoisted refers to being blown up.
5196700	5197700	Blown up into the air.
5197700	5198700	By your own bomb?
5198700	5199700	By your own bomb.
5199700	5201700	I think the original appearance in print is, like, heisted, like,
5201700	5206700	you're being lifted up in the air by, like, people that were sappers that go to blow up a wall.
5206700	5207700	They would put a bomb there.
5207700	5209700	Frequently, they'd blow themselves up.
5209700	5213700	Oh, I honestly crazily had the exact same image in my head.
5213700	5214700	It's like a petard.
5214700	5216700	It was a pirate ship.
5216700	5217700	A guy with fancy pants.
5217700	5218700	For real?
5218700	5219700	I'm not joking.
5219700	5220700	Make it in front of me?
5220700	5221700	I know.
5221700	5222700	I always pictured a guy.
5222700	5223700	It's a pole.
5223700	5224700	And he's got his pants on.
5224700	5225700	Oh, my God.
5225700	5226700	And he's like, blah, blah, blah, blah.
5226700	5227700	He's doing that.
5227700	5228700	He's like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
5228700	5229700	But that's where...
5229700	5232700	I shouldn't have worn my petards today.
5232700	5234700	Don't take a stand if you're wearing a petard.
5234700	5237700	Where somebody lifts you up by your collar and your pants
5237700	5238700	and they carry you out.
5238700	5239700	That's called walking Spanish.
5239700	5240700	Oh, yeah.
5240700	5241700	I love that word.
5241700	5243700	He was walked Spanish out of a place.
5243700	5245700	That's where you get, like, hoisted out.
5245700	5246700	Is that really true?
5246700	5247700	That's so it goes.
5247700	5249700	Back then, Spanish people were...
5249700	5250700	They were always flying.
5250700	5252700	There's a series of really good books by...
5252700	5255700	I think it's Earl Fount from Funk and Wagnalls.
5255700	5257700	One's called Heavens to Betsy.
5257700	5258700	One's called Horse Feathers.
5258700	5259700	One's called Hog on Ice.
5259700	5261700	There's a fourth one I can't remember.
5261700	5265700	And it's all the history of, like,
5265700	5267700	etymology of weird phrases.
5267700	5270700	Like, where to break a leg comes from.
5270700	5273700	Or where to, you know, to know the ropes.
5273700	5275700	It's the first appearances in print.
5275700	5277700	And the titles of all of them are ones that we don't know.
5277700	5279700	We don't know why Heavens to Betsy.
5279700	5281700	But I love break a leg.
5281700	5283700	And it's one of those things where there's lots of different ideas
5283700	5285700	about where break a leg came from.
5285700	5288700	But it's not like a thing that you wish bad things to happen to actors
5288700	5291700	so good things happen, like, as a superstition.
5291700	5294700	To break a leg, when you would bow at the end of a show,
5294700	5298700	it's where you would get up and crack your back leg.
5298700	5299700	And that was being...
5299700	5300700	Make it to the end.
5300700	5301700	Make it to the bows.
5301700	5304700	Because most shows were so shit and the audience would be so...
5304700	5305700	Wow.
5305700	5306700	...would be so angry.
5306700	5307700	So they're just saying,
5307700	5308700	hopefully you get to the end of the show.
5308700	5309700	They're saying don't suck.
5309700	5312700	Because people would, like, the groundlings,
5312700	5314700	the people that would come and that would stand there,
5314700	5318700	they really would bring rotting cabbages and eggs and shit to throw at you.
5318700	5322700	Because it cost a dime or a nickel or a penny to get into the show.
5322700	5325700	And I could be making that dime or nickel out at my stand
5325700	5326700	or doing what I do.
5326700	5329700	And so if the show sucks, they just would throw shit at you and leave.
5329700	5333700	So for an actor to say break a leg, it means make it to the bows.
5333700	5334700	And I love that.
5334700	5337700	But that's, again, that's up for debate because people say different things.
5337700	5338700	I prefer to believe that.
5338700	5339700	Is that where they throw it?
5339700	5341700	Slowly as theater got more and more improved,
5341700	5343700	they started to throw fresh produce.
5343700	5344700	Yeah.
5344700	5345700	Which became flowers.
5345700	5346700	Yeah.
5346700	5348700	And then panties.
5348700	5351700	The freshest of flowers.
5351700	5353700	Panties.
5353700	5355700	The first production of Tom Jones.
5355700	5356700	Yes.
5356700	5357700	By the time he got in there.
5357700	5358700	Yeah.
5358700	5359700	Yeah.
5359700	5360700	All right, let's do it.
5360700	5361700	Pretty gay.
5361700	5362700	Play the music.
5362700	5363700	Pretty gay.
5363700	5364700	Are we doing this shit?
5364700	5365700	Yeah, right.
5365700	5366700	Hang on a second.
5366700	5367700	I guess.
5367700	5368700	Do you not want to?
5368700	5369700	We don't have Aaron.
5369700	5370700	Do we need to replace it?
5370700	5371700	Do you not want to?
5371700	5372700	No, I just am a commercial.
5372700	5373700	Is Aaron not here?
5373700	5374700	Aaron's not here.
5374700	5377700	Haven't you seen?
5377700	5379700	Do you want somebody to play with?
5379700	5380700	Sure.
5380700	5381700	I mean, fine.
5381700	5382700	I don't care.
5382700	5383700	We should get a lady.
5383700	5385700	We've got a lot of testosterone up here.
5385700	5386700	Yeah.
5386700	5390700	Isn't it great to hear three guys or four guys talk about politics and bore everybody
5390700	5391700	senseless?
5391700	5393700	Can we get a gallop up on here to play?
5393700	5394700	What's her new character called?
5394700	5395700	We're going to hand up over here.
5395700	5396700	Destiny Sarske.
5396700	5397700	What's the new character?
5397700	5398700	Tell me real quick.
5398700	5399700	Come on up, young lady.
5399700	5400700	You raised your hand.
5400700	5407700	What is your name?
5407700	5408700	Molly.
5408700	5409700	Hello, Molly.
5409700	5410700	Welcome.
5410700	5411700	Give Molly the thing.
5411700	5415700	I saw this guy make a very vulgar gesture.
5415700	5417700	I was really offended.
5417700	5418700	What?
5418700	5419700	Who did?
5419700	5420700	Wait, what?
5420700	5421700	Do you need this?
5421700	5422700	Oh, those are both yours.
5422700	5424700	Who made a vulgar gesture towards whom?
5424700	5426700	No, towards you guys.
5426700	5427700	Towards you guys.
5427700	5428700	Who did?
5428700	5429700	Who did?
5429700	5430700	This guy here in the yellow shirt.
5430700	5431700	Oh, Adam.
5431700	5432700	What was the gesture?
5432700	5433700	That's the last straw.
5433700	5438700	It was like a fuck you, but it also involved his other hand to show the full.
5438700	5440700	He was fucking me and jacking off.
5440700	5441700	There you go.
5441700	5442700	That's Adam Goldberg.
5442700	5443700	Molly, are you new here?
5443700	5444700	Huh?
5444700	5445700	Are you new here?
5445700	5446700	This is my second time.
5446700	5447700	Okay.
5447700	5448700	Adam Goldberg.
5448700	5449700	He's God's offensive gesture.
5449700	5450700	He's a human middle finger.
5450700	5451700	Yeah.
5451700	5452700	God was like, fuck you, America.
5452700	5453700	Have this.
5453700	5454700	I'm just being serious.
5454700	5455700	I'm just being serious.
5455700	5456700	All right.
5456700	5478780	So, Camille, Spencer, would this be included in your intro to explain to Camille what happened
5479780	5480780	with Aaron's character?
5480780	5481780	Yeah.
5481780	5482780	Okay.
5482780	5483780	I mean, I guess.
5483780	5484780	Yeah.
5484780	5485780	Let's try it.
5485780	5487780	I don't really think about that stuff.
5487780	5489780	Me neither.
5489780	5490780	I know.
5490780	5491780	All right.
5491780	5492780	Where are we going?
5492780	5494780	Here we go.
5494780	5499780	When we last met, our heroes were in some big danger.
5499780	5505780	After what was meant to be a simple dispatching of highwaymen on the road to Rosebook.
5505780	5508620	Mulrain lied dead by her own hand.
5508620	5512260	And the gnome, our heroes aimed to save, had a broken neck.
5512260	5516700	But before the gang could even catch their breath and mourn their fallen friend, a fiery
5516700	5523540	maelstrom of light pushed the gang to escape, who levitated the paralyzed gnome to safety.
5523540	5528300	In town, they met Dignity, a paladin with a friendly, if pushy demeanor, who brought
5528300	5532560	the party to the Constabulary to discuss their travels.
5532560	5537040	After a spot of tea, our gang met Father Tinder, a friendly but perverse old abbot
5537040	5538600	in charge of the city.
5538600	5543080	Tinder was immediately suspicious of the group, but Dignity smoothed things over.
5543080	5548200	There is a moment of calm, but then, Admiral Darkstar, still under the skin of Yomiji,
5548200	5552400	his heavenly host, came blasting through the sky towards the town.
5552400	5558240	The powerful fiend assaulted the town, but was repelled by Rosebook's powerful defensive
5558240	5560640	magic.
5560640	5565120	The ward stood strong, but for how long?
5565120	5571240	And how long before Father Tinder would learn of the gang's connection to their deadly foe?
5571240	5579280	Find out this time on an all-new installment edition of Harmontown Time.
5579280	5603040	So, Dignity, tell us all about yourself.
5603040	5606720	I'm immune to sleep.
5606720	5610840	I do have an Adderall prescription, so that makes sense.
5610840	5611840	That's actually useful.
5611840	5615600	Can I get your number?
5615600	5617120	Don't met a game.
5617120	5618120	Yeah.
5618120	5620760	Yeah, what are numbers?
5620760	5625080	Yeah, what do you mean?
5625080	5627360	Alright, where are we?
5627360	5628360	I wasn't listening.
5628360	5629360	Why don't you listen?
5629360	5633040	Because I'm thinking about having a fight with Erin, and I was listening, I was like,
5633040	5634040	Hey, that makes sense.
5634040	5635040	Is that what she's not hearing?
5635040	5636040	It was a fight?
5636040	5637040	Probably.
5637040	5638040	It's my fault.
5638040	5640200	Because I saw you guys a little while ago, and I thought she was coming.
5640200	5641200	Yeah, I know.
5641200	5642200	I'm not fighting.
5642200	5643200	What happened?
5643200	5644200	You guys are going through counseling.
5644200	5645200	Is that what it means?
5645200	5646200	I know.
5646200	5653440	Sometimes the counseling gives me new ways to be mean to her.
5653440	5657360	Like, I learn new ways to...
5658360	5661040	Can you have a new vocabulary for abuse?
5661040	5664560	Bad, bad fiancé.
5664560	5666800	And I miss her, and I'm sorry.
5666800	5669800	I'm a bad, bad fiancé.
5669800	5671440	I can't hang that up.
5671440	5672640	Hey, these lights are on.
5672640	5675080	I think they're not supposed to be on the camera at some point.
5675080	5676080	Oh, but it's nice.
5676080	5682960	It's like we're doing it in a Caribbean bungalow.
5682960	5685320	Caribbean bungalow.
5686320	5688320	That's why we have that image in our heads.
5688320	5689320	I'm sorry.
5689320	5690320	We did a thing.
5690320	5693320	We met Dignity, and we're in the Constabulary.
5693320	5695320	Camille Angel's trying to get...
5695320	5696320	Erin killed her character.
5696320	5697320	I saw the killing.
5697320	5698320	I was here for the killing.
5698320	5701840	Now she's a new character, which by all accounts is the same person, just with a different
5701840	5705320	name and a different possible outlook on life, but really the same thing.
5705320	5707320	I don't know where you're getting that.
5707320	5709320	She is a great sample size.
5709320	5711320	Oh, just one mission you mean?
5711320	5712320	One day.
5712320	5713320	I mean one, one episode.
5713320	5715320	It seems a lot like the old character.
5715320	5717920	I'm not saying you're necessarily absolutely wrong.
5717920	5719320	I just think it's unjustified.
5719320	5720320	It was a small sample.
5720320	5721320	That's all I'm saying.
5721320	5722320	Okay.
5722320	5724320	So now we're in Rose Book right now?
5724320	5725320	Yep.
5725320	5727320	And is the storm from the Admiral Darkstar still approaching?
5727320	5728320	Is it...
5728320	5730320	Yeah, you're outside.
5730320	5731320	You're looking up.
5731320	5736320	He's still in the body of this angel that he's possessed, and he's circling around and
5736320	5739320	pounding on the dome-like barrier around the city.
5739320	5742320	He can't get in, though, it seems.
5742320	5746320	Well, yeah, looks like he's trying to get in.
5746320	5750320	I should probably go check on those soul rods.
5750320	5753320	Make sure they're holding up.
5753320	5754320	Okay.
5754320	5757320	So those are the perimeters, so you want to go check those out?
5757320	5760320	I'd like to go check out the soul rods.
5760320	5761320	You okay, Sharpie?
5761320	5763320	You seem a little down in the balls a little bit.
5763320	5764320	Yeah, I'm all right.
5764320	5765320	Are you okay?
5765320	5766320	I'm all right.
5766320	5767320	Okay, cool.
5767320	5770320	All right, I'll go check out the soul rods.
5770320	5772320	You go to the nearest soul rod.
5772320	5775320	It seems to be strictly reinforced.
5775320	5776320	There's a cleric.
5776320	5782320	He's praying, and his hands are outstretched, kind of like washing over the rod with his
5782320	5783320	magical energies.
5783320	5784320	He's kind of keeping it powered.
5784320	5788320	Hey, hey, you need any help?
5788320	5789320	He doesn't respond.
5789320	5790320	Hey, I'm talking to you.
5790320	5791320	He's chanting under his breath.
5791320	5792320	Hey, hey, hey, hey.
5792320	5795320	Bad pitch that set him on fire.
5795320	5797320	No, no, no.
5797320	5798320	I'm doing a bit.
5798320	5799320	All right.
5799320	5800320	I was doing a bit.
5800320	5801320	Yeah, just for a bit.
5801320	5802320	Yeah, I was doing a bit.
5802320	5803320	See you later.
5803320	5806320	Good job praying.
5806320	5811320	So these soul rods are kept, the city's protected by its power by prayers.
5811320	5812320	Yeah.
5812320	5813320	And magic.
5813320	5814320	Right.
5814320	5816320	If you listen, you can hear...
5816320	5825320	I must be five and immortal.
5825320	5826320	What?
5826320	5828320	I just sent my pen down, and I played a song.
5828320	5829320	I'm sorry.
5829320	5831320	His pen plays to studio.
5831320	5833320	All right.
5833320	5834320	Okay.
5834320	5839320	So you're at this soul rod, and you're trying to talk to this guy who's not responding.
5839320	5844320	But as you're talking to him, you hear the squeaking of a wooden cart, and you turn,
5844320	5846320	and you see Father Tinder.
5846320	5852320	He's pushing a wooden cart full of kegs and growlers and glasses and cups.
5853320	5857320	He's got all this juice, juice in his cart, and he's pushing it along.
5857320	5859320	And he's like, what is he like?
5859320	5861320	Now everybody keep calm.
5861320	5864320	Our wards have never failed us against evil, and they won't now.
5864320	5866320	Not as long as we hold strong.
5866320	5868320	Now who wants juice?
5868320	5872320	He hands a juice to the cleric who kind of wordlessly grabs it and puts it in his pocket
5872320	5874320	without breaking his incantation.
5874320	5876320	What kind of juice is it, Father Tinder?
5876320	5877320	Oh, all sorts of juice.
5877320	5879320	We got orange juice and grape juice.
5879320	5883320	I guess it's just two kinds of juice.
5883320	5885320	What does the juice do?
5885320	5888320	It, you know, good for the nerves.
5888320	5889320	It's wholesome.
5889320	5890320	It's wholesome.
5890320	5892320	I asked for a growler of juice.
5892320	5896320	He gives you a skin instead, a wine skin, but of juice.
5896320	5898320	I asked for a fucking growler.
5898320	5899320	Hey, man.
5899320	5900320	Hey, hey, hey.
5900320	5901320	Hello.
5901320	5902320	Come on, man.
5902320	5903320	It's customary.
5903320	5906320	Can I have a vial of juice?
5906320	5908320	They come in skins.
5908320	5910320	Can I have a growler?
5910320	5912320	I'll give you a skin of juice.
5912320	5914320	Can I get a goblet of grape juice?
5914320	5916320	I have a wooden cup.
5916320	5918320	It looks like a goblet.
5918320	5920320	I'll take just a portion of juice.
5920320	5922320	He starts pouring juice for you guys.
5922320	5924320	Let's say we take some of this juice.
5924320	5929320	Take it around the corner and do a little CSI on it.
5929320	5930320	See what's in it?
5930320	5932320	CSI?
5932320	5933320	Yeah, see what's in it?
5933320	5934320	See what...
5934320	5936320	I'm sorry, I thought you misheard me.
5937320	5939320	CSI would see what's in it.
5942320	5945320	So as he's pouring you this juice, he's like,
5945320	5948320	so you guys are awfully calm.
5948320	5951320	Oh, we just loved receiving juice.
5951320	5955320	I don't like to drink it around people.
5955320	5957320	I'm going to go around the corner.
5957320	5961320	Just normally when there's giant things beaten down the door,
5961320	5962320	you know, people freak out.
5962320	5964320	Ha, ha, ha, you got it, buddy.
5965320	5967320	That's what she said.
5967320	5968320	Let's go.
5968320	5970320	Let's see what's in this fucking juice.
5970320	5972320	All right, hey, what's your name?
5972320	5973320	Destiny.
5973320	5974320	It's Dignity.
5974320	5975320	Dignity.
5975320	5977320	We just met you, sorry.
5977320	5978320	Yeah, it's fine.
5978320	5980320	I can distract the guy while you do the thing.
5980320	5981320	Oh, yeah, talk to him.
5981320	5982320	He's your boss.
5982320	5983320	He's my boss?
5983320	5985320	Yeah, yeah, he is your boss.
5985320	5987320	Well, he's the boss of the town.
5987320	5988320	I see.
5988320	5990320	She works for the town.
5990320	5991320	I have holy texts.
5991320	5993320	I can read them, write about them.
5993320	5994320	You're reading the holy texts.
5994320	5997320	Yeah, oh, cool.
5997320	6000320	So, yeah, you sidle up to Father Tinder
6000320	6003320	and start reading off scripture.
6003320	6005320	All right, come on, all right, let's go.
6005320	6006320	CSI, CSI.
6006320	6007320	Let's see what's that.
6007320	6008320	CSI.
6008320	6011320	I follow them and we're going to see if we're going to CSI this juice.
6011320	6013320	We're going to go into a doorway.
6013320	6015320	Do we have any CSI equipment?
6015320	6017320	I have Knowledge Arcana.
6017320	6018320	Yup.
6018320	6020320	Thirteen.
6020320	6021320	All right, that's the first thing.
6021320	6024320	I'm just dribbling it on my fingers and I'm checking it out.
6024320	6028320	Yeah, I'm going to do sense motive on it.
6028320	6033320	It seems to want to be drank like this.
6033320	6036320	I use perception on it to see what the deal is.
6036320	6038320	It looks like juice.
6038320	6044320	Okay, because it's been a long day, I go, guys, I'm a gnome.
6044320	6045320	I'm pretty tough.
6045320	6046320	I'm a barbarian.
6046320	6048320	I'll just drink.
6048320	6049320	Oh, no.
6049320	6050320	I'll take a sip of the juice.
6050320	6051320	No, come on, man.
6051320	6052320	Come on.
6052320	6053320	That's not the thing of it.
6053320	6054320	No, we'll try it.
6054320	6056320	He's a juice dealer.
6056320	6058320	He's, I think that's...
6058320	6060320	I honestly think that...
6060320	6062320	You think this is a bad idea?
6062320	6070320	Yeah, because I think the worst case scenario is you go Jim Jones like Jones Town participant.
6070320	6074320	The best case scenario is you don't and then who cares.
6074320	6075320	You know what I mean?
6075320	6076320	Yeah.
6076320	6077320	It's high risk, low yield.
6077320	6082320	Yeah, because either nothing happens that that's not interesting or you die.
6082320	6083320	Okay.
6083320	6084320	So there's no way to win.
6084320	6086320	I don't drink it, Spencer.
6086320	6090320	I don't drink it, but I walk back to Father Tinder at their juice cart.
6090320	6091320	Okay.
6091320	6092320	And I say, oh, thank you.
6092320	6093320	That was delicious.
6093320	6096320	And I look at him expectantly.
6096320	6097320	Okay.
6097320	6100320	What do the rest of you guys do in the doorway?
6100320	6101320	I can detect evil.
6101320	6103320	Should I detect if the juice is evil?
6103320	6104320	Yeah.
6104320	6106320	I should have waited for you to do that.
6106320	6108320	Well, yeah, the juice, it's not evil.
6108320	6109320	Okay.
6109320	6111320	So I go, oh, thank you Father Tinder.
6111320	6112320	You know what?
6112320	6114320	I'm going to put it down on the ground and I have stealth 13.
6114320	6120320	I'm going to sneak up to the juice.
6120320	6122320	I'm pretty sure we could drink this juice safely.
6122320	6123320	I mean, I...
6123320	6124320	No, no.
6124320	6125320	I've got nothing to prove that.
6125320	6127320	I'm not getting a bad vibe off this juice.
6127320	6128320	What about my knowledge arcana?
6128320	6129320	That's it.
6129320	6132320	Well, no, I got caught up in other things, I guess.
6132320	6136320	You use your knowledge of arcana and you find out that it's not magical.
6136320	6140320	It only extends to your knowledge of magic, which this is not.
6140320	6141320	All right.
6141320	6142320	It might be chemical.
6142320	6144320	All right.
6144320	6146320	What about my brew potion feet?
6146320	6150320	Doesn't that mean that I can see a Mickey when I see one?
6150320	6153320	Well, potions are magical, so...
6153320	6155320	Your mom is magical.
6155320	6156320	I wish.
6156320	6159320	That'd be amazing.
6159320	6160320	All right.
6160320	6161320	Well, I don't...
6161320	6162320	Grant and wish.
6162320	6166320	I say to him, I go, I said, hey, Father Tender, I drink that juice and...
6166320	6167320	Fucking...
6167320	6169320	That's the stuff.
6169320	6170320	Yeah.
6170320	6171320	I make it myself.
6171320	6172320	Yeah, so what do you...
6172320	6174320	Did you have some juice today?
6174320	6175320	I always have juice.
6175320	6177320	It's my secret juice.
6177320	6178320	What would you say?
6178320	6179320	It just drops them.
6179320	6181320	It's major property.
6181320	6184320	I'm feeling pretty good, but...
6184320	6185320	Major property?
6185320	6186320	Yeah.
6186320	6187320	Deliciousness.
6187320	6190320	I go up to him and I go, what the fuck, man?
6190320	6192320	That's fucking mind-controlled juice.
6192320	6193320	No, it's not.
6193320	6194320	Yeah, it is.
6194320	6195320	I have skills in it.
6195320	6196320	I can detect it.
6196320	6197320	That's fucking mind-controlled juice.
6197320	6198320	What the fuck, man?
6198320	6200320	And I come in pretending to be under...
6200320	6204320	Juice is commanding me to juice stuff.
6204320	6205320	Fuck.
6205320	6206320	You see this shit?
6206320	6208320	Oh, the juice, almighty juice.
6208320	6213320	I don't want to be rude, but I sense that you're deceiving me right now.
6213320	6214320	All right.
6214320	6215320	Okay.
6215320	6216320	You're right.
6216320	6217320	You got this.
6217320	6218320	All right.
6218320	6220320	The little thing we do when people offer us juice.
6220320	6222320	We've been to a lot of towns.
6222320	6223320	It's just juice?
6223320	6224320	It's just juice?
6224320	6225320	It's juice.
6225320	6227320	We call this due diligence.
6227320	6228320	Yeah, it's just...
6228320	6230320	We call it juice diligence.
6230320	6234320	I bet when you were our age, you tested juice before you drank it.
6234320	6236320	Yeah, I mean, we CSI juice all the time.
6236320	6238320	He said he's got a force field around it.
6238320	6241320	The juice should be suspicious.
6241320	6242320	We're going to drink it.
6242320	6243320	I drink my juice.
6243320	6245320	I'm going to put mine in my pocket.
6245320	6247320	I fucking drink the whole thing down.
6247320	6248320	I'm putting mine in my pocket.
6248320	6249320	I drink mine.
6249320	6250320	I drink my juice.
6250320	6251320	You drink your juice.
6251320	6252320	I give mine to the robot baby.
6252320	6254320	You give your juice to the robot baby.
6254320	6255320	You put it in your pocket.
6255320	6256320	I put mine in my pocket.
6256320	6257320	I drink my juice.
6257320	6258320	Yep.
6258320	6259320	You sure did.
6259320	6261320	I'm going to turn mine into water.
6261320	6262320	Wait.
6262320	6263320	How do you do that?
6263320	6265320	It says that it says divine favor.
6265320	6269320	I think you can create water, but not turd stuff would do it.
6269320	6270320	Never mind.
6270320	6271320	I'm sorry.
6271320	6273320	I'm sorry to disappoint you.
6273320	6279320	I feel like we really sort of got stuck in this juice thing.
6279320	6284320	I think the Kool-Aid man just came by and we got all freaked out.
6284320	6286320	He has a force field over his city.
6286320	6289320	He runs the place like Charles Manson.
6289320	6290320	He's creepy.
6290320	6293320	He sexually harasses his female under legs.
6293320	6295320	And he brings juice around.
6295320	6297320	We were right to check the juice out.
6297320	6298320	Sorry.
6298320	6299320	I hope you didn't hear any of that.
6299320	6300320	I mean, yeah.
6300320	6302320	I'm pretty perceptive.
6302320	6307320	I drink my juice and I try to sense any ill effects or positive effects from it.
6307320	6311320	It tastes a bit bitter, like it has orange rind in it.
6315320	6317320	You know, some people don't like it.
6317320	6319320	I make a poopy face.
6321320	6322320	All right.
6322320	6323320	Yeah, that happens.
6323320	6325320	Hey, Father Tender.
6325320	6326320	Yeah.
6327320	6332320	How long do you think your soul rods will hold out against this demon angel?
6332320	6337320	Oh, you know, they'll hold out forever as long as God's favors on my side.
6337320	6340320	He pats a pocket on his chest.
6340320	6341320	What is that?
6341320	6342320	What?
6342320	6343320	What's in your pocket, sir?
6343320	6345320	Oh, I don't have a pocket.
6345320	6348320	He reveals no pocket where he was padding.
6351320	6352320	See?
6352320	6353320	No pocket.
6353320	6355320	What were you padding over there?
6355320	6356320	God's favor.
6356320	6357320	It's in your heart?
6357320	6358320	It's in my heart.
6358320	6359320	Oh.
6359320	6360320	No pocket, though.
6360320	6361320	No pocket, though.
6361320	6362320	I showed you.
6362320	6363320	Nothing?
6363320	6365320	Nothing in the juice?
6365320	6366320	Nothing in the juice.
6366320	6368320	Why do you think there's stuff in the juice?
6368320	6372320	Yeah, you kind of run things in an autonomistic way.
6372320	6374320	I mean, no.
6374320	6375320	Do I?
6375320	6377320	That's not true, is it?
6377320	6378320	Autocratic.
6378320	6379320	What do you think?
6379320	6380320	He's great.
6380320	6381320	It's great, right?
6381320	6382320	I'm on his side.
6382320	6383320	This is awesome.
6383320	6384320	I love it.
6384320	6385320	I love the force field.
6385320	6389320	I think everybody loves the force field.
6389320	6391320	Guys, we're not anti-force fields.
6391320	6392320	Guys, just try the juice.
6392320	6393320	It's a little bitter, but, you know...
6393320	6395320	I gave it to the baby.
6395320	6397320	What's the baby's name?
6397320	6398320	Laji.
6398320	6399320	Laji.
6399320	6400320	Laji, did you like it?
6400320	6401320	I... I...
6401320	6403320	Oh, was I supposed to drink it?
6403320	6404320	Yeah.
6404320	6405320	No.
6405320	6407320	I don't drink stuff.
6407320	6408320	Yeah, Laji, don't drink anything.
6408320	6409320	You know what?
6409320	6410320	I'm gonna drink it.
6410320	6412320	Is this the episode where we just stand around and talk about juicers?
6412320	6413320	Sounds like it.
6414320	6416320	This could be the most important episode of my life.
6416320	6419320	Yeah, it's like the most boring Anthony Bourdain episode.
6419320	6422320	Let's just not get antsy and start burning the place down.
6422320	6423320	No, no, no, we're good.
6423320	6424320	All right, I'll drink the juice.
6424320	6425320	I'll drink your juice.
6425320	6427320	You drink the juice.
6427320	6428320	Orange wine?
6428320	6429320	Fuck.
6431320	6432320	Yep.
6432320	6433320	Some people don't like it.
6433320	6434320	I don't like it.
6434320	6435320	It's gone.
6435320	6436320	I got grape juice.
6436320	6437320	How does the grape juice taste?
6437320	6438320	It tastes great.
6438320	6440320	You guys should have gotten grape juice.
6440320	6442320	I drank some back around the corner.
6442320	6443320	It's great.
6443320	6445320	Hey, can I have some grape juice?
6445320	6447320	Sure, there's enough juice for all.
6447320	6448320	What's the point of this?
6448320	6449320	Just for refreshments?
6449320	6450320	Yeah, it's my thing.
6450320	6452320	I mean, you have hobbies, right?
6455320	6457320	Could you show us where you make the juice?
6457320	6458320	That's my juicery.
6458320	6460320	Well, can you take us there?
6460320	6461320	We're a big juice fan.
6461320	6463320	Hey, guys, everyone, let's go to the juicery.
6463320	6464320	We drank the juice.
6464320	6465320	We love juice.
6465320	6466320	We want to see where the juice is made.
6466320	6467320	All right, let's go.
6467320	6468320	All right.
6468320	6469320	To the juicery.
6470320	6472320	This is the best fucking D&D of all time.
6472320	6473320	I can do it.
6473320	6474320	Let's do it.
6474320	6476320	Not only can we talk about juice,
6476320	6478320	we're going to go see how it's made.
6481320	6483320	It's my favorite person, Mr. Rogers,
6483320	6485320	when he's like, let's go to the milk plant.
6485320	6486320	I'm like, oh, Jesus, kill me.
6488320	6490320	This is every fucking role player's fantasy.
6491320	6492320	Is that wheatgrass?
6492320	6494320	Can I get a shot of wheatgrass?
6494320	6495320	What's wheatgrass?
6495320	6497320	All right, I guess that answers the question.
6498320	6499320	Here we go.
6499320	6500320	To the juicery.
6500320	6501320	To the juicery.
6501320	6502320	Oh, look at that building.
6502320	6504320	Oh, yeah, you could ride the horse.
6504320	6507320	But you get there way before everyone else.
6507320	6508320	That's fine.
6508320	6509320	All right.
6509320	6510320	Hey, when was that building made?
6510320	6511320	I pointed a building.
6511320	6512320	I don't know.
6512320	6514320	What's that building do?
6514320	6515320	That's the house.
6515320	6517320	Who was born there?
6517320	6520320	I don't know that anyone was necessarily born there.
6520320	6521320	Where's the juicery?
6521320	6523320	It's right here.
6523320	6524320	Are we at the juicery?
6524320	6525320	We sure are.
6525320	6526320	How far is it?
6526320	6528320	It's here currently.
6528320	6530320	Are you shropping the juicery right now?
6530320	6532320	Sounds like it.
6532320	6533320	All right.
6533320	6535320	Oh, here we are.
6535320	6536320	Cut.
6536320	6537320	Fuck it.
6538320	6541320	The sense of anticipation.
6541320	6543320	Do we just walk in or?
6543320	6547320	No, standing outside, standing outside of the juicery is,
6547320	6550320	it looks like a knight who seems like he's been standing there a while
6550320	6553320	and he also seems like he's been drinking.
6553320	6555320	It's a juice knight drinking juice.
6556320	6559320	No, no, he seems drunk, I should say.
6559320	6560320	Oh.
6560320	6561320	What's your knight's name?
6561320	6564320	Oh, that's Darmvon.
6564320	6565320	Hey, Darmvon.
6565320	6566320	Hey.
6566320	6569320	It already feels like what that name makes me think we weren't supposed
6569320	6571320	to come to the juicery.
6571320	6576320	That feels like a name that was thought of when the sentence was started.
6576320	6579320	If we die outside of a juicery, I'd be very disappointed.
6579320	6580320	So.
6580320	6581320	Darmvon.
6581320	6582320	Hey.
6582320	6583320	Darmvon, step aside, matey.
6583320	6585320	We're going to go inside and see how juice is made.
6585320	6588320	Just like one second.
6588320	6591320	I just want to talk to Father Tinder real quick, okay?
6591320	6592320	Okay.
6592320	6593320	As you like.
6593320	6594320	Yeah, go for it.
6594320	6596320	Father Tinder's like, that sounds fine.
6596320	6598320	Gentlemen, if you give us a bit of privacy.
6598320	6599320	Oh, privacy.
6599320	6601320	We didn't say we would give you privacy.
6601320	6604320	Hey, look, if it's important, you can say it in front of me.
6604320	6605320	Yeah.
6605320	6608320	I'd really rather not.
6608320	6609320	This happens.
6609320	6611320	I think everyone's allowed to hear everything.
6611320	6613320	No, let them hear it.
6613320	6614320	Let them hear it.
6614320	6615320	Let them hear it.
6615320	6616320	It says, Darmvon.
6616320	6617320	Father.
6617320	6618320	Darmvon said that.
6618320	6619320	Okay, great.
6619320	6620320	Darmvon.
6620320	6621320	What?
6621320	6624320	You know, you know, we got it.
6624320	6627320	You know why this demon thing's here.
6627320	6630320	And you can stop it, Father.
6630320	6633320	And Father Tinder's like, I don't know what you're talking about, man.
6633320	6634320	This guy's crazy.
6634320	6636320	He's like a heretic or something.
6636320	6642320	And Darmvon's like, you're, you fucking, you, you got to listen.
6642320	6643320	You got to give it up.
6643320	6645320	Otherwise, he's going to kill us all.
6645320	6647320	You got to give it up.
6647320	6649320	And Father Tinder's like, I don't know.
6649320	6651320	I don't know what you're talking about.
6651320	6652320	Can you guys help me out?
6652320	6653320	Can you help me out here?
6653320	6654320	I'm glad we listened to this conversation.
6654320	6655320	Who's saying that?
6655320	6656320	Father Tinder.
6656320	6657320	Father Tinder.
6657320	6658320	He's like, this guy's crazy.
6658320	6659320	Well, we want to hear what he has to say.
6659320	6660320	He's crazy.
6660320	6661320	We'll just dismiss it.
6661320	6663320	A lot of times alcohol just releases the inhibitions.
6663320	6665320	I mean, it doesn't mean that what he's saying isn't true.
6665320	6666320	Alcohol's evil.
6666320	6667320	Okay.
6667320	6668320	He's going to kill us all.
6668320	6669320	No, he's not going to kill us.
6669320	6670320	He's mad on alcohol.
6670320	6673320	You can't silence dissent.
6673320	6674320	Let's hear it out.
6674320	6676320	That's how stagnation breeds.
6676320	6681320	And then pretty soon you're going to have juice tanks rolling up and down the streets.
6681320	6687320	If you won't give it up, I'm going to take it from you and give it up myself.
6687320	6689320	What does give it up mean?
6689320	6694320	What's it called?
6694320	6696320	He draws his sword quickly.
6696320	6697320	Oh, no.
6697320	6701320	And moves at and moves towards Father Tinder.
6701320	6703320	What do you do?
6703320	6707320	I fucking stand back and watch what's about to happen.
6707320	6708320	No.
6708320	6712320	I go and I get in the way and I'm like, hey, Knight, tell us what you mean, Darwin.
6712320	6713320	Please don't attack.
6713320	6714320	Let's use our words.
6714320	6717320	It's what separates us from animals.
6717320	6723320	So he lunges at you because you step into his path and...
6723320	6724320	My hands are up.
6724320	6726320	Yeah, your hands are up.
6726320	6731320	And he slips and he falls and impales himself on his own sword.
6731320	6733320	It's a critical fail.
6733320	6738320	And the life pulses out of him as he bleeds onto the floor.
6738320	6741320	Father Tinder goes, that's fucked up.
6741320	6744320	So that will remain a mystery.
6744320	6746320	But that guy's fucking up.
6746320	6748320	All right, let's go to the juicery.
6748320	6750320	Let's see how juice is made.
6750320	6751320	Juice!
6751320	6753320	Juicery.
6753320	6756320	Thank you for coming, everybody.
6756320	6761320	Harmontown, thank you, Molly, for helping us out.
6761320	6762320	You're very well done.
6762320	6764320	What a great job Molly did.
6764320	6768320	Yay!
6768320	6774320	Let's thank Camille Nogiani, Spencer Crittenden, and I'm Jeff Davis.
6774320	6777320	Am I forgetting anybody?
6777320	6780320	Dave Clark was in the back room when it never came out.
6780320	6783320	The mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Herman.
6788320	6791320	This show brought to you by Poopy Sand.
