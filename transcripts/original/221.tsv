0	18240	Let's hear it for Babes, everybody, Babes!
18240	28440	Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden and everybody, as Hymantown is now in session.
28440	29440	Keep it going, Babes.
29880	30880	Keep rocking.
40720	44720	Let's bring out the mayor of Hymantown, Dan Harmon.
59440	60440	Thanks, Babes.
60440	61440	Babes Band?
61440	62440	Babes.
62440	63440	Babes.
63440	64440	Babes.
64440	78520	Babes Band is your Twitter handle because you're not 70 years old, so Babes was taken
78520	80840	when you started your Twitter account.
80840	84040	Somebody probably got on the ground floor of at Babes.
84040	87440	Are you starting the show as Ed 209 tonight?
87440	88440	Is it on?
89440	92440	You couldn't hear that?
92440	93440	No, I can't.
93440	95440	To me, my voice sounds normal.
95440	96440	Let's listen for you.
102440	105440	Alright, let's get started.
105440	107440	So, it's unorthodox.
107440	109440	We're Spencer normally 12.
109440	112440	We have Spencer, we have a band of four people.
112440	114440	Yeah, I noticed that too.
115440	120440	Spencer is now sitting over here in Kumail Nanjiani territory.
120440	124440	Yeah, I feel like I get where he was coming from now, sitting on this side of the stage.
124440	129440	I just feel like I'm together and we've got to talk to Dan over here.
129440	130440	But it's great.
130440	135440	You definitely rose to beyond Kumail or even Harmon status in New York.
135440	138440	For those of you who heard the New York show, Spencer did a great job.
138440	142440	We were Jeffilists and Spencer stepped up.
142440	143440	Thank you.
143440	144440	Good job.
147440	148440	Yeah, and then we elected a Nazi.
148440	150440	I don't know if that was going to come up tonight.
153440	154440	I was out of town.
154440	156440	What happened?
156440	158440	It was a squeaker.
158440	161440	I kept saying the media was going to make it seem like a squeaker.
161440	168440	That makes the 23rd out of 23 political predictions I've been wrong about.
168440	171440	Starting with, we'll never see a black president in my lifetime.
171440	172440	I really said that before.
172440	176440	I was talked into believing that first that it was going to be really tight,
176440	181440	but then towards the end, we were talked into the idea that it was in the bag for Hillary.
181440	185440	Of course, I said a few times he was going to win it.
185440	189440	Not that I wanted him to, or I don't even like putting that out there.
189440	194440	I do kind of believe in the words you say can manifest themselves.
194440	196440	They can create things.
196440	197440	I do believe that.
197440	202440	I also really felt that it was an increasing possibility all the time.
202440	208440	I was in London during the week and a half before the Brexit vote,
208440	211440	and depending on who you talked to, most people are like,
211440	212440	oh, no, it's not going to happen.
212440	213440	It's not going to happen.
213440	217440	You talk to anybody that was working class, they're like, it's happening.
217440	219440	It was going to happen.
219440	225440	I'm sure the election will be permeating tonight as a theme, I'm sure.
226440	229440	Including the analysis of the statistics and stuff.
229440	237440	To me, what I am keen to talk about, because it's most scary, most promising,
237440	243440	most exciting to me, is the cultural, not ramifications,
243440	248440	but the cultural thing that's happening, of which I think this election is a symptom.
248440	254440	Because it's a real thing that we have to deal with on our sidewalks and things
254440	259440	and in conversations with each other, the people with actual human hearts and brains
259440	266440	that we touch and whose breath we can smell and who are renting properties to or from us
266440	269440	and who we buy and sell bread to.
269440	274440	I haven't been into the market in a while, and I don't know how commerce works.
274440	281440	I pay people to count my filthy money, but the human beings are neighbors and things
281440	285440	and douchebags.
285440	292440	We know that our friend Kumail had an incident at a bar.
292440	298440	Is it these young douches that got drunk?
298440	304440	It turns out later, in the analysis afterward of this story,
304440	310440	the bartender was filling them in and saying that they have alt-right meetings over at this certain bar.
310440	315440	I guess I won't name because I'm not sure what I'd be doing by naming the bar,
315440	320440	but that they have alt-right meetings in the back room and that this is a bar close by
320440	323440	and that one of those two guys had been there before.
323440	326440	It's not like Clockwork Orange where it's like,
326440	330440	holy shit, the fabric of society is changing necessarily just because of that story,
330440	335440	but in case you didn't see it, the story was that Kumail and Thomas Middleton were hanging out at a bar
335440	339440	and two guys that had been drinking for a couple hours came up to them and said,
339440	343440	hey, we're big fans and I disagree with what you say on Twitter about Trump.
343440	346440	And then they said, let's not talk about politics.
346440	349440	And they said, what are you, a cuck, cuck, cuck, cuck?
349440	353440	And they started chanting the word cuck, which if that's going to happen...
353440	360440	I didn't know that that was an alt-right term for people that have been cuck-holted by politics.
360440	362440	What is the angle on that?
362440	365440	It's just an attack on, I think, masculinity.
365440	367440	Oh, no, that you're not a man.
367440	369440	You're just like a beta male.
369440	374440	I think it's more of a beta male thing to really focus on the sex life of other people.
374440	379440	But again, I don't know if you've seen cuck-holed porn, but there's this guy, Marcello,
379440	384440	who's a cuck-holed, who is very alpha.
384440	391440	He cuck-holed himself so much that he owns the room.
391440	398440	I got no beef with a guy that's so low status, he can suck another man's penis while that man fucks his wife.
398440	405440	I think that guy's pretty fucking intimidating.
405440	409440	And she goes, look at my bald slave, and he's like...
409440	411440	And his eyes are just dead.
411440	413440	And I'm like, this fucking guy...
413440	416440	I'm following him into battle.
416440	420440	Not somebody who's like, what'd you say?
420440	424440	Like, this guy's cool under fire.
424440	427440	He's licking balls, you're not supposed to want to do that if a guy's fucking your wife.
427440	429440	That's the last thing.
429440	431440	So he's topping from the bottom, though.
431440	433440	He likes it, like he's in charge.
433440	435440	He's eating the world from hell.
435440	437440	Yeah, I don't know what I'm going to tell you.
437440	438440	He's amazing.
438440	439440	He's my hero in that.
439440	441440	I just did a comedy show last night.
441440	442440	We were down in...
442440	447440	The gig was in Escondido, California, kind of down San Diego way, like south of Carlsbad.
447440	451440	But we stayed in Rancho Santa Fe, which is quite rich and white.
451440	455440	And I went to have breakfast or lunch yesterday.
455440	460440	And there was this woman that came in, and she was very Orange County...
460440	468440	Just picture a wealthy Orange County middle-aged woman who was pretending to be 19.
468440	471440	And she was quite loud, and they were talking about Chardonnay and varietals of grapes,
471440	473440	because they're all wine people, and it was fine.
473440	476440	I was reading my book, so I was pissed off.
476440	479440	But that's my fault for reading a book at a bar and expecting silence.
479440	481440	And then she started talking.
481440	484440	I thought you hated yourself for reading.
484440	487440	I thought you were going, and here I am reading.
487440	492440	I like reading alone at a bar or at a restaurant, and I expect graveyard silence,
492440	496440	which is self-destructive and stupid.
496440	499440	But I do bring earplugs, but then I'm wearing earplugs in a bar,
499440	501440	and everybody has a right to look at me and go,
501440	503440	this guy is a fucking piece of shit.
503440	506440	And I can dig it.
506440	509440	But it was totally silent for the first 45 minutes I was there.
509440	511440	And then this woman came in and was talking to two other people,
511440	513440	and they were talking about grapes and wines.
513440	515440	And then she was like, oh, yeah, my daughter just got married,
515440	518440	and my son-in-law is so amazing, he's a marine, and they have a dog.
518440	526440	And the dog is named Mary, but it's short for America.
526440	529440	And as I drove down there, when you pass the Orange Curtain,
529440	531440	you get down into good and proper Orange County.
531440	534440	It's Trump stickers and Ford F-150s and all that jazz.
534440	537440	But then they all started talking in hushed tones about politics,
537440	539440	about the election.
539440	540440	They were all Hillary people.
540440	542440	They sounded like they were going to be Trumpies.
542440	545440	But then I heard another guy, later on, football was on,
545440	549440	a guy sits down with this white guy with this white girlfriend or wife,
549440	551440	and an interception happened.
551440	555440	And he yelled, oh, god damn it, you fucking monkey.
555440	557440	And I was the only one that heard it.
557440	560440	And I just turned to him and went, whoa.
560440	562440	And he goes, oh, whoa, whoa, why do you assume
562440	564440	I was talking about an African-American?
564440	567440	I said, whoa, double whoa.
567440	570440	That's a metal whoa.
570440	572440	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
572440	575440	And I said, I'm watching the same TV you are, man.
575440	578440	And he goes, you fucking jackasses.
578440	580440	He mutters to his wife, he goes, fucking jackasses.
580440	582440	What other words are they going to take away from us?
582440	584440	Yeah.
584440	587440	So then I said, oh, I'm going to guess you voted for Trump.
587440	589440	He goes, no, we voted for Hillary.
589440	590440	Exactly.
590440	591440	So thank you.
591440	594440	But he felt activated, I felt.
594440	597440	I feel that I'm not criminal non-Giani, and I'm not brown.
597440	602440	And I didn't get poked in my chest by some alt-right weirdos.
602440	607440	I just feel like that was the first time I've ever heard somebody
607440	609440	feel that comfortable to yell that out.
609440	612440	And also, strangely righteous indignation.
613440	614440	I didn't go, fuck you, racist.
614440	615440	I didn't say that.
615440	616440	I went, wow.
616440	617440	Right.
617440	619440	And he was like, fuck you, racist in his head.
619440	622440	So that's what I want to talk about tonight.
622440	624440	And I'm very proud of myself.
624440	627440	I lined up some guests that are not based on, oh, this person
627440	629440	represents this, that, in keeping with that.
629440	632440	I invited random people that I came across.
632440	635440	They better be all white males.
635440	636440	They aren't.
636440	640440	But I do want to say before we, because tonight is going to be,
640440	644440	and if I have anything to do with it, it's about moving forward
644440	646440	into, like, I don't care.
646440	649440	Don't, if you're listening to this and you're offended by a straight
649440	653440	white dude saying, we need to erase the lines and solidarity,
653440	659440	he's not kidding us anywhere, I'm not telling you not to see lines
659440	665440	and I'm going to express that, where I'm at and how I'm going
665440	669440	to move forward the best way I think I can help and use my I
670440	671440	statements.
671440	675440	I am certainly not here to tell particularly, especially the last
675440	680440	person I want to tell not to see things in lines is the black women
680440	684440	in our family tonight, because I feel like that was an astounding,
684440	686440	almost comedically absurd story.
686440	689440	Like, if you looked at the statistics and you were looking at lines
689440	693440	and how they broke down, that was a bummer.
693440	697440	Like, they lined up and they were like, yep, what you see is what you
698440	699440	get.
699440	703440	Voting for Hillary, she's not, like, she's a woman and I'm a woman
703440	707440	and there's a million reasons and blah, blah, blah, and they came
707440	709440	home and it's like, let's get our lady president.
709440	711440	What the fuck?
711440	714440	You honky bitches.
714440	718440	42% of the women vote went for Trump, is that right?
718440	720440	Yeah, I don't even know.
720440	724440	We've all seen the spreadsheets that have, like, befuddled us.
724440	728440	And then we search for meaning with our primate mind.
728440	731440	I trusted Jake Tapper.
731440	732440	He lied.
732440	734440	I think the message from those spreadsheets, from this election,
734440	737440	from everything, the thing that's going to keep me sane is going,
737440	741440	like, oh, thank God, it may be in a very twisted, horrible,
741440	745440	balloon animal way, but Martin Luther King finally just actually
745440	749440	became, his dream is actually becoming a little bit true because I
749440	753440	cannot look at anybody anymore or think about anybody based on any
753440	756440	group that they belong to and assume anything about them.
756440	761440	I think that election, like, you can now say that you have more in
761440	765440	common with a person you haven't met yet than some of the people you've
765440	766440	met.
766440	769440	You can now say that you have more important things in common with
769440	772440	people who have superficial things not in common with you.
772440	777440	And I don't want to speak for my people that are shaped like me.
777440	781440	But before that Tuesday, I was walking around thinking that, like,
781440	785440	the idea that biology didn't matter, race, gender, to name a few,
785440	789440	bio lines, a million of them, though, the things that just make us
789440	792440	different, like, in the goo that makes up our body.
792440	796440	The idea that that stuff didn't matter, I always looked at it like
796440	797440	broccoli.
797440	802440	Like, really healthy, really hard to commit to, like, not the first
802440	806440	choice, like, when I'm secretly thinking about what I'd rather do,
806440	810440	like, kind of difficult, worth it, we'll make everything better.
810440	814440	Oh, so hard to do, and no one else is going to do it anyway.
814440	819440	And after Tuesday, like, I swear it's not hyperbole, it was just like
819440	824440	the one good thing for me was I was like, holy shit, no.
824440	828440	The idea that you can't tell what people are thinking or feeling or
828440	832440	where they're coming from by looking at them is not like broccoli, it's
832440	833440	like air.
833440	837440	It's impossible now to not be in that mindset.
837440	842440	It's absolutely vital, and it's relatively empty, and we have to fill
842440	844440	it with something meaningful.
844440	846440	That was a dumb way to extend that metaphor.
846440	847440	I should have stopped that.
847440	851440	It just went from being like, oh, you should really do that, okay, I
851440	855440	will, and walking around like that monkey guy who clearly was yelling
855440	857440	at himself before you did.
857440	860440	He was like, he had all this shit, you were yelling at him before
860440	861440	being arrested.
861440	864440	That guy's already, we got this fucking World Wrestling Federation
864440	867440	wrapped up in our brains because we're surrounded by it.
867440	874440	Anyway, so, like, the big question becomes, how do we stop being
874440	878440	surprised by shit, how do we, that was my therapist advice, stop
878440	882440	expressing yourself with, like, Dan, you keep going like this, and your
882440	884440	voice keeps going up in the air because you keep going, there's a
884440	888440	swastika up over the house in San Francisco!
888440	890440	Can you believe what they did?
890440	894440	And they're like, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, no!
894440	897440	It's all in that context of, can you fucking believe it?
897440	898440	Can you believe it?
898440	901440	And you hear that story about Kumail, and always the unspoken thing
901440	905440	on Twitter is, like, when you retweet stuff, which you should do, the
905440	908440	unspoken message of it is, like, can you believe this?
908440	913440	And that, for the last 20 years, has been enough.
913440	916440	Like, that has been our definition of the guillotine, it's been our
916440	922440	definition of, like, just, like, transparency of rule of law socially,
922440	926440	because there are no laws against, like, you know, having weird
926440	930440	feelings about, you ate three bananas, now you're a woman.
930440	933440	You can have, like, these fucked up ideas that if a Supreme Court
933440	936440	justice has them, bananas, illegal!
936440	941440	And we're like, whoa, hey, those thoughts aren't illegal.
941440	945440	And so we have, up until now, had the luxury of going, can you believe
945440	948440	this person feels this way?
948440	952440	Now, it seems clear to me that it's like, oh, you've got to believe it.
952440	956440	You've got to believe it, and coming with that is, like, then if you're
956440	959440	going like this, you're the sucker.
959440	962440	Like, can you believe this guy's mugging me?
962440	966440	Well, yeah, Steven Seagal can, that's why he's not getting mugged anymore.
966440	967440	What a terrible example.
967440	969440	You guys don't admire Steven Seagal.
969440	974440	I'm 43, he was, like, really, he was badass.
975440	978440	For, like, six months of 92, I think.
978440	981440	I couldn't think of a name of a guy who's famous for not getting mugged.
981440	988440	I forget, maybe I remember, I'm not sure if I know the exact order of the
988440	992440	five stages of grief, but do you know which, Spencer or Dan, do you know
992440	994440	which one you're in right now?
994440	995440	Well, I'm...
995440	997440	I'm going to assume not acceptance yet.
997440	1001440	Well, or you could say either this grief doesn't apply or I'm all the way
1001440	1005440	to acceptance because we need to do more than grief.
1005440	1009440	If our friend is getting harassed in a bar, we don't have to go grab our muskets,
1009440	1012440	we don't have to go, because we don't know those guys represent the alt-right,
1012440	1016440	we don't know what the alt-right is, we don't know, we just, we have to,
1016440	1020440	we have to straighten our backs, square our shoulders, take a deep breath in,
1020440	1022440	go, this is happening.
1022440	1028440	Like, there are skinheads, there are angry people, there are people you can't,
1028440	1036440	every person that is walking toward you, it has either dynamite or pudding
1036440	1041440	or pudding being a good thing, like the opposite of dynamite,
1041440	1044440	but it's a bad thing to have in your head because you need to think.
1044440	1048440	So, again, my metaphors are failing, but I'm saying every person that you
1048440	1050440	encounter is good, could be...
1050440	1051440	Explosive or delicious.
1051440	1056440	...a god or a monster, but very likely something incredibly sloppy
1056440	1062440	and unpredictable in between that is going to require, like, very, very, like,
1062440	1068440	like, in the moment negotiation and also, though, before you enter that chaotic world,
1068440	1073440	an agreement about how we behave, for instance, when I've seen some pictograms
1073440	1075440	that were being posted that I thought were kind of cool, it's like,
1075440	1081440	what do you do when you see a dude bullying a Muslim woman on a subway
1081440	1083440	and it, like, shows you in pictograms, like, what you should do?
1083440	1086440	It turns out what you should do is walk up to the Muslim woman,
1086440	1088440	start hanging out with her as if the guy doesn't exist
1088440	1090440	and as if you've known her for 20 years.
1090440	1093440	Hey, how are you? I haven't seen you in a while.
1093440	1099440	I mean, probably, you know, it's better than going, like, get your hands off her.
1099440	1104440	I got sidetracked by that, but, like...
1104440	1107440	Are you saying, I mean, yeah, I mean, we should all...
1107440	1110440	Like, if I saw someone doing that, I would absolutely go up there
1110440	1114440	and intervene and step in at the risk of getting, like, punched, like...
1114440	1115440	Well, I...
1115440	1118440	But the thing is, I don't know, I would piss my pants and cry
1118440	1120440	and so I want to talk to people who don't know how.
1120440	1125440	It's like, I feel like you're bragging.
1125440	1130440	No, I mean, I'm saying hypothetically because it's always been a hypothetical.
1130440	1133440	Now, I don't think it's going to keep being a hypothetical.
1133440	1136440	I think it's going to be something that you're going to run into a lot now.
1136440	1139440	I want to plan for it and I'm going to need powerful friends, Jeff.
1139440	1142440	Powerful, powerful friends.
1142440	1148440	From the Marvel universe, you know her as the red sorceress.
1148440	1152440	Now it's Scarlet Witch. It's Elizabeth Olsen.
1152440	1153440	Hit it, babes.
1153440	1172440	Yeah.
1172440	1178440	The obvious joke to make is like, hey, could you use your signature Marvel power
1178440	1181440	to undo that election?
1181440	1185440	But I've seen two movies now and I can't figure out what your signature power is.
1185440	1189440	It seems like you can do anything to anyone, but it involves red light.
1189440	1194440	Yeah, that's as much as I understand.
1194440	1197440	And I think at some point there's...
1197440	1201440	I get to manipulate time, I think.
1201440	1203440	At least in the comics.
1203440	1206440	Oh, good, because your character was kind of weak, so I was hoping they would give you...
1207440	1208440	The movies are different.
1208440	1210440	Is your mic on or are you just far away from it?
1210440	1211440	I don't do this much.
1211440	1212440	There you go.
1212440	1213440	There you go.
1213440	1214440	Thank you.
1214440	1218440	That doesn't make me curious.
1218440	1226440	When you're in a movie like that where you're shooting Gagos and everything's like...
1226440	1231440	So then, let's say, Joss Whedon comes up like, okay, we did one take.
1231440	1233440	Now he's going to give you an adjustment.
1233440	1234440	What is he...
1235440	1237440	He actually made up the whole movement.
1237440	1240440	It was all in his head, so he had various...
1240440	1241440	He demonstrated it?
1241440	1242440	Oh, yeah.
1242440	1245440	He wrote it moving like me.
1245440	1247440	At least he told me that.
1247440	1254440	And he would physically ask me to do different physical things and demonstrate it for me.
1254440	1256440	And the Russos don't do that.
1256440	1258440	They don't understand.
1258440	1260440	They're like, I don't know what to do with you.
1260440	1263440	Why don't you go away and figure it out with your choreographer?
1263440	1265440	And I'm like, okay, great.
1265440	1268440	I love what I do, but we'll talk about it later.
1268440	1271440	But anyway, this is so frivolous.
1274440	1278440	I wasn't going to go on to ask you, what's it like to wear so much makeup?
1278440	1281440	I was going to eventually...
1281440	1284440	I did invite you on because we were doing a project together,
1284440	1288440	so you were one of the first people I saw in the wake of all this.
1288440	1292440	In the wake of every woman in Los Angeles going through something
1292440	1294440	that I'm not even allowed to pretend I understand
1294440	1297440	because that's just part of the problem and blah, blah, blah.
1297440	1300440	And that makes me more mad, makes me want to be manly and do things.
1300440	1303440	And that's what the problem is because we just elected a guy
1303440	1305440	that wants to be manly and do things.
1305440	1310440	And I can't mansplain, but the only thing to explain is that I want to mansplain.
1310440	1313440	And not being able to mansplain is making me angry.
1313440	1318440	And my therapist has verified that that is every couple right now that's coming through.
1319440	1325440	As a Star Wars fan, I would call a carbon-scored feeling panel
1325440	1331440	that was tricked over, let's face it, 180 years
1331440	1335440	into putting a little fiber optic cable out
1335440	1342440	and then it just got sliced off with this Cronenbergian penis-slimy knife.
1342440	1347440	Tricked you, got you, and now they're just wandering.
1347440	1350440	Anyways, what was I talking to you about?
1350440	1357440	We were talking about, I mean, I don't know if I represent a feminine response.
1357440	1358440	No, not at all, no.
1358440	1359440	But I mean, just because I don't...
1359440	1361440	No, you were like, I just pull out my dick and vote.
1361440	1362440	Yeah, that's exactly what I said.
1362440	1365440	I was like, whoa, it's huge, but it blows red and I can't.
1365440	1367440	No, no.
1367440	1372440	I was actually not in the country because I did a mail-in vote
1372440	1375440	and handed it in because I was so scared to trust the mail service.
1375440	1380440	And I was in Mexico City and so that was really interesting
1380440	1381440	and I was talking...
1381440	1383440	How fast are they going to build this thing if it...
1383440	1385440	Well, yeah, I mean...
1385440	1386440	I can have one more margarita, right?
1386440	1387440	I mean, again, the joke is, is now they're like,
1387440	1391440	yeah, let's fucking build a wall so no one from America can come in.
1391440	1395440	That's the only joke to make now, but I had a friend when I was saying,
1395440	1397440	you know, really emotionally on Wednesday morning,
1397440	1403440	I was like, how can there be so many racist and xenophobic people and sexism
1403440	1405440	and everyone's so uneducated.
1405440	1408440	Our education system has failed us.
1408440	1411440	He just said, you know, I don't like my president.
1411440	1415440	I didn't vote for him, but there are a lot of people in my country who did
1415440	1417440	and a lot of people make $2 an hour.
1417440	1420440	Well, he first told me that was part of the problem for saying that.
1420440	1424440	And then he said, you know, I don't blame the guy who makes $2 an hour
1424440	1428440	for voting for our president because he actually bought his vote
1428440	1429440	and gave him a refrigerator.
1429440	1430440	And I don't think he's stupid.
1430440	1431440	I don't think he's ignorant.
1431440	1434440	And I'm not saying we're in the same situation.
1434440	1437440	We don't measure things in refrigerators and boats.
1437440	1440440	So they're coming along down there.
1440440	1443440	I measure them in delicious Trump steaks.
1443440	1446440	But that is something to think about.
1446440	1449440	Like, okay, how am I part of the problem by just naturally assuming
1449440	1452440	that all these people are this, this, this, and this.
1452440	1454440	How are you part of the solution, you mean?
1454440	1456440	Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry.
1456440	1458440	You said, how am I part of the problem?
1458440	1460440	Yes, I am part of the problem.
1460440	1461440	Right, because you're a woman.
1461440	1462440	No, no, I'm kidding.
1462440	1464440	Yeah, and because I have a vagina.
1464440	1465440	Right.
1465440	1468440	It's full of mystery and betrayal.
1468440	1469440	And the way?
1469440	1471440	Just ask the blacks.
1471440	1473440	That's what I came here tonight to do.
1473440	1475440	Erase lines.
1475440	1480440	Yes, it, how are you, that's what I'm trying to figure out is like,
1480440	1484440	okay, so I, yeah, it's like, and there's lines behind lines behind lines.
1484440	1487440	Because when I hear that story about Kumail at the bar, I'm like,
1487440	1488440	oh, bullies.
1488440	1489440	Right.
1489440	1490440	That's what a bully is.
1490440	1493440	And I'm like, and then that means I need to do this and this and that.
1493440	1495440	I don't know those two guys.
1495440	1500440	I know, I know, I know five things about them, all of which totaled,
1500440	1504440	make them douchebags, and they needed to be dealt with in that moment the way
1504440	1506440	that they were dealt with.
1506440	1512440	And we would be foolish to not ask ourselves at this point, should we,
1512440	1515440	there's two things to think about for me.
1515440	1519440	How do I deal with the anxiety, like in a healthy way?
1519440	1523440	Which Emily Gordon, Kumail's wife, like posted some stuff.
1523440	1526440	There's been a lot of great things online with people going like,
1526440	1528440	you got, you're filled with this shit right now.
1528440	1533440	It's a, the consensus seems to be it's a great time to go volunteer for stuff.
1533440	1536440	Like, which sounds like a fucking last thing you want to do.
1536440	1540440	As like, but, but, but it's like, I think it's a thing to like,
1540440	1544440	if I force myself to like go to 826 LA and see what I can do to help,
1544440	1548440	like that somehow that'll lead to some kind of relief in a healthy way.
1548440	1552440	But the other thing is that I can't ignore is like, aren't we supposed to get ready
1552440	1554440	for some fucking fisticuffs?
1554440	1559440	I ordered a salad tonight at the restaurant because I got to stop eating Doritos
1559440	1563440	because there's Nazis.
1563440	1566440	And I would be, I would be very foolish to be like, well, you know,
1566440	1567440	maybe they just need a hug.
1567440	1573440	That to me sounds like a great origin story for an Avengers character.
1573440	1574440	I never understood.
1574440	1577440	I actually, I don't understand fighting violence with violence.
1577440	1578440	I just have never understood that.
1578440	1582440	So if someone, I don't, I mean, you know, I think kudos to say,
1582440	1583440	I think I'd stand, you know,
1583440	1587440	I'd stand straight up at that person and get him to back down.
1587440	1589440	I think there is a version of that,
1589440	1592440	that doesn't have to be violent and confrontational,
1592440	1594440	but I, you and I talk,
1594440	1599440	have talked a lot about the idea of lines and divides and trying to figure out,
1599440	1604440	you know, no one's people are so scared to say how they felt.
1604440	1610440	And it's because the people who have the privilege to be on social media
1610440	1615440	and have a lot of followers or to be on a podcast or to be on whatever,
1615440	1617440	they tend to all kind of believe the same things.
1617440	1620440	And we're all just talking to each other.
1620440	1625440	And I think, you know, with algorithms and Facebook and you just see what you
1625440	1626440	want to see.
1626440	1630440	And, and I don't understand how that's ever going to change anything.
1630440	1633440	Yeah. We were all just talking to ourselves the whole time.
1633440	1635440	Like if you, if you like one side or the other,
1635440	1637440	you were only listening to that one side.
1637440	1640440	Even when you're so surprised that there is another side,
1640440	1641440	you just weren't listening to it.
1641440	1644440	Well, also why is a parakeet surprised that there's a mirror in its cage?
1644440	1646440	Like we are, we are, why, why,
1646440	1649440	why are people chanting for Hulk Hogan shocked that someone's
1649440	1651440	into the iron chic at the same event?
1651440	1654440	Like we are being sold.
1654440	1659440	Because of the camel clutch, the camel clutch with a devastating move.
1659440	1663440	I think another, another thing that's that was kind of like a weird relief
1663440	1667440	was that, um, I, cause I, I don't like, uh,
1667440	1671440	as a celebrity or an edit person who's in movies.
1671440	1676440	I don't, I don't like the idea of, uh, being like, I believe this.
1676440	1679440	So therefore I'm going to change all your opinions because I believe it.
1679440	1681440	And I think that's like a weird egocentric thing.
1681440	1683440	And that's kind of what Hollywood did.
1683440	1686440	And what we were talking about when I brought it up the other day,
1686440	1693440	you said, no one's going to look at Jay-Z and be like, oh, Jay-Z wants Hillary for president.
1693440	1696440	I have so much in common with Jay-Z.
1696440	1699440	I'm going to vote for Hillary now. Like they've got nothing in common.
1699440	1701440	I've got 99 problems too.
1703440	1705440	But is a bitch one?
1706440	1707440	It is now.
1707440	1708440	It is now.
1711440	1716440	I've got 99 problems and a bitch not being in the White House is one of them.
1717440	1720440	He puts out a new version of his.
1721440	1722440	Yeah. What were you talking about?
1722440	1727440	I mean, the Jay-Z example kind of like blurs lines, uh, for, for me
1727440	1730440	because I get scared and white and like, well, again, I don't, it's like,
1730440	1738440	like there is so it's like, I can't fucking blank-splain anything to a certain, certain like, like, yeah.
1739440	1740440	That's going to be the new thing.
1740440	1741440	That's what I will say.
1741440	1742440	It's going to be the episode title.
1742440	1743440	What were you saying?
1743440	1747440	I was like, like, if I, if I'm, if I'm working in a, I'm going to,
1747440	1749440	I'm going to take some liberties and create a cartoon character.
1749440	1756440	If I'm, if I'm, if I'm Joe welds a lot coming off of my half closed factory job
1756440	1759440	and going to Pizza Hut because it's the fanciest restaurant in town and it's payday.
1759440	1763440	And I'm like eating with a knife and fork because, because pizza's fancy food for me
1763440	1766440	because I live in, in, in Poe Duncea.
1767440	1769440	I'm taking liberties.
1770440	1774440	I'm saying assume the guy that's the least receptive to this message.
1774440	1777440	So Joe, Joe welds a lot from Poe Duncea.
1777440	1783440	The TV in the corner, I'll listen as Robert Downey Jr. on it saying like, look, we have to talk tomorrow.
1783440	1786440	You have a choice to make and the power is in your hands.
1786440	1787440	And it doesn't really matter.
1787440	1793440	I'm like, they made a funny self-effacing like kind of like meta version of that thing.
1793440	1800440	But I'm just saying like that the bottom line of that message isn't, oh, look what I'm doing
1800440	1802440	or I'm making you aware of something.
1802440	1803440	Everybody knows the election's coming up.
1803440	1809440	Everybody, everybody that cares about voting because they feel something at stake for them
1809440	1814440	because they're not hopelessly disenfranchised is going to vote because it's actually about them.
1814440	1816440	And like they feel that way.
1816440	1823440	And so a person saying like, look at me, you got to vote and you got to vote right.
1823440	1830440	Like if I was the slightest bit inclined to like, you know, not believe in the elitist path, you know,
1830440	1835440	like liberal King's Landing that I'd be like, see, there we go.
1835440	1840440	I would pull the other lever twice just because I'd be like, don't, don't.
1840440	1844440	And so it's, but it's probably doing, it's bolstering the base, you know, somewhere else.
1844440	1847440	I don't know what we got on this topic. It's stupid.
1847440	1850440	It's more, let's bring out Brandon Johnson. He'll help us.
1850440	1852440	Oh, yeah. Hit it, babes.
1859440	1861440	Brandon Johnson.
1865440	1870440	The only guy who is always better dressed than me.
1871440	1873440	How are you, folks?
1874440	1877440	See, look at you healed and shit, you healing.
1878440	1880440	I'm glad you all made it out. Thanks for having me down.
1880440	1884440	That's another thing. It seems like we can't enjoy anything anymore right now.
1884440	1886440	Well, not not this week. Don't rush us.
1886440	1889440	Exactly. Like, like, I feel like if I'm smiling, someone's judging me.
1889440	1893440	Or if I'm like having a lunch, like I can't be enjoying the food I'm eating.
1893440	1901440	I've been forcing myself to express my pissy kind of comments as jokes, recognizable as jokes on Twitter.
1901440	1908440	And I, but then someone will go like, I'm just waiting for somebody to go like, yo, you didn't make that joke about Hillary or whatever their response is.
1908440	1913440	That's not either. That's funny. I don't even want to hear. That's not funny. That's not funny. Don't tweet at me.
1913440	1915440	What is he fucking?
1918440	1920440	This president almost got me to say retarded.
1923440	1925440	Brandon, where are you at right now? What's up?
1925440	1926440	Oh, hi, Brandon.
1926440	1939440	Oh, man, it's awesome. It's like if you if you were a Native American and you you looked over and you were like, all I noticed was that your motherfuckers wasn't shooting at me and trying to steal my land no more.
1941440	1946440	What is going on out there? It looked like white people mad at each other.
1947440	1957440	This is the greatest day we're actually because the weird shit is there were no shootings two to three weeks of Native Americans black people.
1957440	1963440	Oh, there was a dip. There was a dip. We started hitting a lighter shade of brown. That's right.
1964440	1973440	So it has been amazing to watch. It is like it's like a Super Bowl or a baseball game.
1974440	1983440	You know, do you really think there would you would you speculate that that is a symptom of any kind of solidarity, like the idea that you knew it this shit.
1983440	1985440	You never had your dreams crushed.
1989440	1997440	Let me let me let me tell you this shit for y'all is like it's almost like if a black kid was laying in a pool of blood.
1998440	2004440	You know, and for hours this shit and then a bunch of people videotaped it.
2005440	2012440	You were like, I'm fucked up over that. And then it kept happening and there were like five hundred and eighty five in a year.
2012440	2016440	Your heart would already be broke. So this shit is like amazing.
2017440	2030440	Are you saying that you think like like the Chicago P.D. was less inclined to start shooting people that they knew were black American citizens because now they're starting they're starting to defend borders.
2031440	2041440	I'm saying I look down and I see upper matic. I see troops on either side fucking each other up over some shit that I'm not really a part of.
2042440	2049440	I'm gonna get fucked over either way. It's like white people once they come together after this Republican Democrat shit.
2050440	2055440	It was a little less feelings and one like white people were running up to me like, damn, this is fucked up and I just want to apologize.
2056440	2067440	So I'm like, you'll be all right. Well, if you keep dressing up like you're from Nation of Islam from 1965, you might get grandfathered into a shooting.
2071440	2076440	Be careful. See what I'm saying? See how comedy can bring us together.
2080440	2081440	As long as it's. Yeah.
2084440	2089440	You feel like your dreams got crushed because you were about to do some real cool shit. I know how you feel.
2090440	2098440	You were like, we fucking with fucking Obama right now. We got eight years. We're about to do some cool shit. We gentrifying. We making moves, motherfucker.
2098440	2105440	Everybody is out there kicking it right now. We're doing ecstasy. We're kicking it. This is the greatest motherfucking country in the world.
2106440	2113440	And then all of a sudden, just as you were about to get that last drink, somebody came and smashed your dream.
2114440	2125440	And I'm I've been there. I'll be there every time I try to order a drink. I can't get this. So let me give you the handbook of how you can make it through this shit.
2125440	2137440	Lay it on us. Oh, run. I don't know what you're gonna do. You got to run. Bring your kids close.
2138440	2150440	I can't. Number one thing really is like, don't panic. It's a long fucking hall. You got to understand this motherfucker got about two years, really, because in those last two years, we're gonna come at you.
2150440	2161440	Don't come at you. You know we are. That's number one. Stop being bitches about the shit. You act like you and Mogadishu like motherfuckers ran up on your house in trucks and were like, pull your daddy out.
2162440	2174440	Where I come from, where Mexicans come from, where Asians come from, motherfuckers die during election season. People leave town to get the fuck out because it might be a new president.
2175440	2191440	Okay, I don't want to just clear those bars as a society. I'd like to avoid getting as low as comparing ourselves to an election where people are getting killed instead of voting. But to your point, we are pussies.
2192440	2201440	We're not pussies and it's great that we're upset. We should be upset. That was some bullshit that went down. But you better get the fuck back up because we live in Whoville. You hear me?
2202440	2209440	And the Grinch looks at us. I want him to hear us singing. I don't want that motherfucker.
2212440	2220440	I thought it was from Horton Hears a Who and I was like, I know what he reads that one. Horton is there? Horton is there?
2220440	2237440	Horton Hears a Who is the apocalypse now of Seuss books. It's like all the film students are like, masterpiece, masterpiece. Fucking watching that shit. He has six hours of fireworks and Martin Sheen dancing.
2238440	2251440	Bonus DVD. Now the French scene's in it. Are you trying to make me kill myself? Sorry, I got off on a tangent. You made me picture a scene that has nothing to do with what you're saying and I can't.
2252440	2265440	My OCD, because when I misunderstood you earlier, there was a cop on the foot of his bed getting dressed for work and he had slept through the election results and he assumed that Hillary got elected.
2266440	2282440	And so he's lacing his blue laces navy with the usual tooth gritted, resigned, numb determination. Time to go back into the demilitarized zone and fight a war that can't be won.
2283440	2293440	And then his wife comes in with some orange juice and some pancakes and she goes like, you seem a little glum. And he's like, yeah, another day, another dollar.
2294440	2303440	And she goes, you didn't watch the results last night, did you? What are you talking about? We elected some email lady.
2304440	2321440	No, honey. We're racist now. Shut up. The whole country. Against who? Name them. Pick a country.
2321440	2336440	And then he's like, so I don't have to represent racism while trying to do your job of policing the public? No, it has been taken up by every man, woman and child in the country.
2337440	2350440	So my job is to serve and protect the racist, the racist, zippity-doo-dah. And then he walks past a black kid who is helping his friend move and is holding a TV.
2351440	2354440	But that's a crime.
2355440	2369440	But on any other day, and he goes like, need help with that? And then he gets it over to the car and he gets in and he goes, thanks officer. And he's like, no problem. Just try to be a little more low profile.
2370440	2379440	What do you mean in helping my friend move? You were helping your friend move? You thought I was robbing someone? Yeah. But we're building a wall.
2380440	2394440	Yeah. I'm still racist. I'm just in a good mood right now. Yeah. You just became the smallest racist fish to fry. I have. Like racism is my life now. It's like it should be. It's Christmas.
2395440	2407440	I was like on I don't know if you watched SNL last night, David Chappelle. No, it was the funniest bit was in a way was David Chappelle and Chris Rock.
2408440	2420440	They're in a room filled with white people screaming at the television, finding out that Hillary was losing. And they're like, oh, my God, I can't believe there's so many racists in this country. And they're just like, yeah, what do you mean?
2421440	2438440	You just figured that out because of this election. There was all this sexual assault in the comedy community. Right. And comedians are clowns. They're clowns. That's what we do. When you hear that they're like raping clowns, you should probably perk your fucking ears up.
2439440	2455440	When you hear that there's shit going down, you should probably should have known because we're living in what so many other people saw coming up. If you were down on the ground, if you're fucking suffering, if you're a woman, if you're handicapped, you're gay, if you're black in the United States, you knew what the fuck was about to go down. I'm not surprised.
2455440	2470440	So many homophobic handicapped people right now are just like, fucking keep it up, man. Keep putting me on that list. And because because we're not surprised, we're not don't we're not tripped out about the shit. So don't you be tripped out about the shit. Just fucking work.
2470440	2484440	That's what people don't talk about in the news media as much as they ought to is how homophobic most handicapped people are. It's not a joke. It's a real fucking thing. It's not a popular topic. It won't get you, you know, winning any popularity contest. But it might get you elected.
2484440	2503440	But if if you wait until there's a huge population of homophobic handicapped people, and one side is completely ignored them, and then you go, we're gonna build a big ramp, dick proof wall. We're gonna build a giant ramp that gets you to all the pussy and keeps all the dick underneath it.
2505440	2508440	That's what Pence is planning on doing if we impeach Trump, by the way.
2508440	2511440	I know. Well, that's the other thing.
2511440	2538440	No, no, we can't impeach Trump. We need him in there. We need that we need that we need this thing to absolutely become a sinking ship and watch the whole thing consume itself. Because if he gets busted for one of his 90 rape trials that are coming up, like the guy that looks like Eisenhower, who hates gay people more than anybody goes into office, and then the shit's for real then.
2538440	2549440	Well, I think about the irony of that when I remember eight years ago, like I said at the top of the show, I truly am 43 years old grew up in the 70s. I really, truly believed we didn't have it. It wouldn't have happened. I was like, holy shit.
2549440	2564440	I was as total surprise to me that we we Obama got elected. And so my first thought was, oh, shit is a lot of like white liberals are like, like, is he gonna get it? Is he gonna get assassinated? And then and then the response to that would always be like, oh, with a chuckle.
2564440	2578440	Oh, God, not President Biden. So think about the irony of the fact that we were chuckling about that. And then what Trump now Trump gets elected again, your first thought, because you didn't see it coming. Is he gonna get assassinated?
2578440	2607440	Everybody? No, no, no, not President fucking Pence. What? Like, that guy knows exactly what to do. Like, like, like, like, like, we got, it's gonna take two years for Trump to find the phone. Like, like, there's already articles about him. Did you see the thing about he announced he wants to do things a little different? He's gonna he doesn't want to spend very much time in the White House. It's almost adorable. It starts to make you think like, what if he's gonna get it?
2607440	2625440	Yeah, but he's gonna leave Rudy Giuliani and like, you know, what to do? They you know, Newt Gingrich, he invented this whole fucking mess. He's like, we just call it not what it really is. And then we don't have to talk on the same reality as everybody else. And that's like where we're at. And his name is Newt, plain sight.
2625440	2648440	Newt, Newt Draconis from the not at all lizard people. I don't think global warming is a problem. Just, I mean, sometimes you need a little sun. Sometimes you need a fuck load of flies.
2649440	2651440	Sometimes you need a fuck load of flies.
2652440	2656440	Giuliani is the only person that claps louder when he hears 911 than our audience.
2659440	2674440	That guy is straight up every every clinician I've I've I texted I because I've done this before. I've seen people on a monitor and I've I've texted doctors that were in the area and said, is he sundowning? Yes.
2674440	2689440	Yes. Like, like, that was what a sundowning. I don't know what that phrase meant. The sundowning is like people suffering from Alzheimer's disease dementia Alzheimer's. Like, they there's a phenomena where they were wolf around the sundown hours.
2690440	2702440	That's called that's called moon wrapping. There can be a huge shift sometimes to euphoria sometimes to like super anger, often just confusion and stuff agitation. It's probably very, very agitating to like, like, yeah.
2702440	2708440	Giuliani is going through a weird metamorphosis where he's looking more like one of those fishes that you only see in the very deep, deep ocean.
2711440	2719440	Where the teeth are doing a whole of a weird thing and then he's like, he's Trump's flavor flame. Like he was like,
2719440	2740440	like, well, no one's no one's getting a guillotine when he talks because he's not running for anything. And then Trump won and he's like, bring out the Legion of Doom. And it was just like this fucking like it was like, it was like the end of Michael Douglas is the game.
2741440	2751440	I know, I know, I know Michael Douglas didn't produce the film, but I just mean the Michael Douglas movie, the game when it's like at the end of the party, it's like, oh, you were there and you were there.
2754440	2761440	The Secretary of Transportation, Chris Christie stepped on my joke with your kiss.
2763440	2768440	I connected the dots of transportation and Chris Christie. I bet nobody, nobody's thought of that.
2771440	2780440	What's next? Secretary of Garlic, Count Dracula? He'd hate it. He'd get rid of it.
2781440	2783440	Secretary of Garlic.
2783440	2795440	Yeah, bad things are bad. Bad thing. But yeah, this is all a mishmash. It was a big casserole. We got this political thing, which like the voting and the thing. It's important. It's important. I'm not going to be jaded about that anymore.
2796440	2804440	I still maintain stop yelling at people on Twitter about how they voted for some bad person or whatever. People went out.
2805440	2806440	Your name's Jill Stein. You don't have to be mean about it.
2807440	2824440	I said 300 million people in this country and like a fraction of them vote every four years. And every, every time we do this ritual where when it's a squeaker, like we, we compare the numbers, the mark, and then we look, oh, when you voted for Harambe, that person wasn't on anyone's side.
2825440	2837440	We should be impressed that they wanted to express themselves and be counted. I like that we remember every four years how fucked up the electoral college is, but we're never mad about that for the three and point nine years in between.
2838440	2845440	I want to change it. Change it. It's not right after it worked and had a thing and we can't change it now, especially with the Republican House and Senate.
2846440	2862440	I want to know who are the 49 million people that didn't vote and like, what, who, we should be concerned with those people. Those are the real, those are the, we stood by evil triumph, you know, they have their own creepy weird ass party that could take over both of our fucking parties.
2863440	2871440	We got to find out who had it so good that they didn't care was going to be bad or who had it so bad they didn't care was going to be good.
2872440	2881440	You know, I blame. I feel like the, uh, the turnout among babies was very low. Yeah. Yeah. I talked to the baby folk.
2882440	2892440	Lizzie, you were gonna say something. I don't remember. Okay. Get nervous. Let's see if I had something to say. Oh, I did.
2893440	2903440	I was going to say what you did too. Do you remember what you were going to say? Cause I just remembered what I was going to say. No, you go girl.
2904440	2917440	I was going to say, like, I appreciate the humor, but we can't attack. Like right now, attacking any group of anything isn't, isn't actually helping. It's not helping, but we're, I mean, we're, we're, we're Don Ricklesing right now. We're going like Mexicans vote like this. Whoa.
2917440	2946440	We're putting a big headline on it, which is like, cause I was like, well, there's this observational humor to be made. Like you see the statistics that as a white person, you're like, you're fucking like, you're like, I was watching the numbers and looking at the statistics. And at one point I swear to God, there was a thought briefly, just to, just to, you know, how like the thoughts are just going. And then they, the embers that come out of the campfire, they mostly just disappear when they're two inches from the fire.
2947440	2959440	And then others cause huge fires. Um, for one moment, like a little, there was a little spark in my head when I saw the number of immigrants that weren't voting. I was like, you fuckers. Now I want a wall.
2961440	2973440	You're ruining the election. It would help. I should be protected from you. It would help if there was a day off. That's the big deal. You know, nobody knows, but if you have a shitty job, your boss does not let you go.
2973440	2983440	No, that's fucking insane. And you don't get enough time to vote. Like what do we get in California an hour? Like sometimes you need, yeah, that's, well, I guess I haven't been told that for my employer cause they told me an hour.
2984440	2992440	But, uh, I think they should, I told you not to vote the whole day. I think they should move the day we all vote to Christmas Eve.
2993440	3004440	I, it's, it's, it's obviously insane that it's not a holiday that makes no fucking sense at all. We don't want the, we don't, it's very clear that we don't want everyone to vote. We don't want it to be a thing.
3005440	3014440	But he repealed the voting rights act. It was like a big part of the civil rights movement and we got rid of it. Yeah. In the swing States where, uh, Trump won.
3015440	3035440	Now it's back. Yeah. Trump won. I fixed it. What the hell happened? A guy in a tank shop just made a weird sound and walked away. Was that one of the babes? It's a, it's statistically speaking, uh, uh, uh, 30% of Los Angeles voted for Trump. I think it was the base player of the babes.
3037440	3041440	Hey babes, you're sitting over there. Uh, you want to introduce yourselves and say hello to the gang.
3042440	3052440	Are your, are your mics hot? Can we hot up their mics? Is anybody driving the ship back here? They're hot now. All right. They're all getting high back there. You're hot.
3053440	3066440	Wait. Oh shit. Wait. All right. You get vocal effects. What's your, what's your name over there, sir? With a mustache. Oh, of course Zach. Hello. And I'm Sarah.
3066440	3092440	Now you guys have been pretty candid online about you being huge Gary Johnson supporters. So, uh, you guys, I'm joking. Of course. You guys want to weigh in? No, we don't mix. That's rock and roll treason. We don't mix. Yeah. Well done.
3092440	3121440	Or Bob Dylan, like Bob Dylan or the sex pistols. Yeah. Or hip hop. It's all right. It's all right. Actually, I have a question. Uh, I, I tweeted about it. I went the day after the, like the Wednesday morning. I went and got a coffee and a bunch of glum hipsters and Silver Lake were all looking bummed out while they were ordering $11,000 quiches and croissants. Just to introduce you guys.
3122440	3134440	I reject you officially no longer know that those guys aren't Nazis because two of them poked Kumail in the chest. Well, it happened in Silver Lake. Yes. Oh my God. It happened in Silver Lake. It happened in Silver Lake.
3137440	3149440	Where all the liberals go. Just when you thought it was safe to have artisanal yogurt. I'm not, I'm not, I'm tired of letting you shame me, Brandon.
3150440	3158440	What liberals are having a hard time right now. So everyone was like, wait until you have to pick up your kids from the morgue.
3160440	3177440	Why you might, might just leave him. Why do you have to pick him up? Can't you just leave him there? I'm not going to know liberals. Kids are pre-morged. We don't reproduce. We are. We love, they'd get in the way of our wine tastings.
3178440	3192440	But anyway, there was glum people and a girl, like a young kind of hipster barista chick from behind the counter, kind of smiled like, you know, the kind of a rise, semi-arounding smile. She goes, well, on the bright side, at least music's going to get good again.
3193440	3202440	But then I tweeted that and it's somewhere back and someone's pointed out quite rightly. I'm assuming that I don't really listen to new music and certainly not. I don't listen to enough hip-hop.
3203440	3210440	Hip-hop has already been going through kind of like a golden age. Some people think like, I think moving past the, I'll explain it.
3213440	3217440	Hey Dan, why don't you feel this one for us?
3217440	3221440	You've had enough power, sir.
3222440	3225440	I just want to go back to the cave.
3226440	3228440	Wait this shit out.
3229440	3233440	So there's a little too much auto-tune, but there's a lot of passion.
3234440	3236440	Go ahead, Brandon, what's your take?
3238440	3240440	Try to be more informed than that.
3241440	3246440	Because some of us jerk off to the hip-hop Pandora channel.
3247440	3248440	What?
3249440	3250440	Really?
3251440	3253440	Yes. That's really not racist of you.
3254440	3255440	That's so good.
3256440	3264440	For those of you listening at home right now, you can download Dan's entire rant on that with the harmontown.com slash woke.
3268440	3269440	Anyways.
3271440	3274440	Well, no, I wasn't really waiting for your take on hip-hop having transformed.
3275440	3276440	Not in the bow tie.
3277440	3284440	Brandon and I are more, we bond when we get together about the lost days of the true golden age of hip-hop.
3285440	3288440	The early years, you know, when rap was slow.
3289440	3291440	Right. And rap was very, very slow.
3292440	3293440	When it was slow and focused on peas and carrots.
3294440	3295440	Yeah. Okay.
3295440	3299440	Hey, babes, can you guys lay down a beat or no? Is that outside of your bailiwick?
3304440	3306440	We're kind of a bass heavy...
3307440	3309440	Is that one about to freestyle?
3309440	3311440	Yeah, let's see what we got.
3312440	3316440	In these sad political times, sometimes music and then poetry.
3317440	3318440	You do. Oh, nice.
3319440	3320440	Yeah.
3321440	3322440	Oh, yeah.
3325440	3328440	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
3330440	3331440	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
3332440	3342440	Well, have you ever had a sandwich on some bread and realized you were in bed and the crumbs go down to Superman's house and you have to fight a super mouse?
3343440	3345440	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
3346440	3347440	Old school.
3348440	3350440	Have you ever enjoyed a bowl of soup?
3351440	3353440	And the next thing you know, your body starts to poop.
3353440	3360440	You get diarrhea from this damn dish and throwing up that soup is your wish. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
3361440	3368440	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Huh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
3369440	3374440	Well, have you ever laughed in a song? Have you ever brought your momma along...
3374440	3375440	Yes.
3376440	3384440	...that we could have if we only believed in Sav?
3385440	3395440	Everyone loves Sav. Sav. I give Sav my art to Graff. Put that ointment on. Rub it on your body all night long.
3396440	3401440	Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha.
3401440	3403440	Well, have you ever been in the middle of a rap?
3403440	3404440	Yes.
3404440	3406440	And you didn't know what to say? Uh-huh.
3406440	3413440	So the end of the rapping line, you just decided to lay it down a little. Uh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh.
3413440	3421440	Uh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh. Uh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh. Uh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh. Uh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh.
3421440	3430440	Reaganomics made rap better. Reaganomics made rap better. And also made us wear sweaters a lot and zippers.
3430440	3435440	And we had straps and women were doing a lot of aerobics. Uh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh.
3435440	3443440	In pantyhose. Uh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh. Uh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh. Uh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh.
3443440	3448440	Well, have you ever done a rap? Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Have you ever... I'm sorry.
3448440	3455440	Have you ever interrupted... No, I was just wondering if you'd ever done a rap. No, that's... No, I was asking a question. I wasn't starting at first.
3455440	3461440	Well, I've done a rap and I'm right over here. Great. Oh, great. I'm glad we covered that.
3461440	3469440	My question was, um, what's this? Have you ever done a rap that sounded like Johnny Cash vaguely?
3469440	3475440	Like the talk section of the Johnny Cash album instead of a real rap song? Have you ever done that?
3475440	3484440	Well, I bought it one piece at a time. And it didn't cost me a dime. Uh-huh-huh-huh-huh. Uh-huh-huh-huh-huh.
3484440	3489440	Presampling law. Rap. I bought it one piece at a time. Yeah.
3489440	3494440	There's one piece at a time. I'm doing the Johnny Cash. He's doing the Rihanna hook on this one. Yeah.
3494440	3500440	No. We know. We got it. We knew it. One piece at a time.
3501440	3509440	There's a name on this rhyme. You take one piece and put it on another time and then you put the times together and you have multiple rhymes.
3509440	3515440	They're like amino acids that form a gene that makes biology work, if you know what I mean.
3515440	3518440	Even though I pronounce it weird.
3518440	3530440	Biology. I started trying to rap too fast and I wanted to rap in the past so I could rap real slow and make it last.
3530440	3540440	Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. I walked the line. You know you walked the line.
3540440	3543440	I walked the line.
3570440	3580440	I'm going to rap super fast too. I've always rapped this fast and I'm rubber and you're glue and I see a nation.
3580440	3585440	It's disintegration but I'm not Haitian so I don't have an HIV crustacean.
3585440	3592440	Oh. Walk it back. Keep it flowing. I'm rapping fast.
3592440	3599440	Rapping fast and I'm growing as a person and a Samoan. What's with those people? Why are they so big? I'm sorry. God damn it.
3599440	3606440	Alright. Just a white brain rapping. Just a white brain rapping. Don't rap too fast with a white brain.
3606440	3612440	Have you ever noticed the Japanese are taking all these pictures? God damn it.
3612440	3620440	Godzilla, Godzilla, Godzilla, it's a Trump filler. Trump filler. Godzilla, Trump filler.
3620440	3628440	A Godzilla kind of Johnny Cash. Lay it on the line. The lines are going on a walking line.
3628440	3637440	I walked piece at a time and it didn't cost me a dime. You know it's me when I come for your time.
3638440	3647440	Loves women. I hurt myself today. He hurt himself today! He hurt himself today!
3647440	3660440	And if you listen closely, you heard me say, oh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho. I try to laugh like a sound like I'm having fun, but I'm really sad cause Donald Trump won.
3660440	3664440	It's really sad, Joe. It's a fake laugh.
3664440	3683440	Everyone in a wheelchair hates gay people today. How does it feel, wheelchair people, to be boxed in and told you're homophobic with no power to control it?
3683440	3692440	Yo, if you have wheels on your chair and you've got a heart, then you're still on the air with me up in heaven. Cause you're dead.
3692440	3705440	Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho. Well, Charlotte, Man and Reno, just to watch him die.
3705440	3711440	Riverboat, Riverboat, take me down. See, I would do it for six hours. They knew to end it.
3711440	3720440	Whoo!
3720440	3732440	Babes, that was awesome. Fucking wow.
3732440	3737440	What the listeners don't know is that Spencer and Lizzie were doing a dance the entire time.
3737440	3742440	We could make an album of Harmontown songs and sell it as an album.
3742440	3753440	Actually, actually I recorded, ha ha ha, with somebody already. So we'd have to go through legal, but I'm sure Kesha would be down.
3753440	3760440	Two chains, Usher, there were like 14 people in the booth, so.
3761440	3767440	Yeah, Brandon, well you couldn't see why you were doing the double time fast rap. Dan was like, you piece of shit.
3767440	3769440	How dare you.
3769440	3773440	You said you would rap slow with me tonight.
3773440	3785440	I said, come on my show and rap like we used to in the 80s, before it got hurtful and angry and for talented people.
3785440	3790440	Back when it was just bell bottoms and kick lines and peas and carrots.
3790440	3795440	I'm pretty sure we now owe Rick Rubin lots of royalties on what I just did.
3795440	3801440	And everybody from that generation of hip-hop and apology, I didn't mean you weren't talented. That's ridiculous. I didn't mean that.
3801440	3803440	I meant I'm not talented enough to rap fast.
3803440	3806440	We have the Sugar Hill Gang coming on next week, so you can apologize.
3806440	3811440	We don't really like what you just said.
3811440	3815440	We're doing the best we can.
3815440	3823440	Now don't push me, cause I'm close to the end.
3823440	3833440	That's how slow hip-hop moved is that the whole refrain was about them getting close to.
3833440	3846440	But then the verses would be about Superman hands you your car keys and you get into your car and you start the ignition and press the gas pedal and you start to go far.
3846440	3856440	But you haven't gone far yet. You still check your mirrors and you look at your blind spot and you start to pull out but you've never been good in parallel parking.
3857440	3864440	There was a point in early hip-hop where Debbie Harry from Blondie was one of the three best rappers in the world.
3864440	3872440	I mean she was beautiful though, so of course she was allowed to rap.
3872440	3880440	It's really weird when you listen to that Blondie song and you're listening to her doing that.
3880440	3887440	That's like a YouTube kid taking a butter container and tapping it and turning it around while they do it.
3887440	3890440	It's like, oh it's an experimental style.
3890440	3894440	Like that's Blondie trying her hand at this thing from the streets.
3894440	3898440	Like, no, my name's Blondie, I'm here to say it.
3898440	3901440	I don't know, it's kind of funny. Because she's doing the same.
3901440	3903440	But she had Fab Five Freddy with her, right?
3903440	3906440	I mean it worked. That song does fucking work.
3907440	3911440	She was in New York at the time and we don't know, Blondie probably could have been down.
3911440	3913440	She was tight as fuck.
3914440	3917440	We have Blondie's child is here tonight.
3918440	3924440	His rap name is tight as fuck, so nice shout out to yourself, tight as fuck.
3924440	3927440	I thought he was just complaining as her son that she was, yeah.
3929440	3931440	Yeah, 17 hour labor.
3932440	3934440	It's not on my end.
3935440	3937440	She's not really fucked.
3938440	3940440	Jesus Christ.
3948440	3950440	So, oh, me? Am I in charge?
3950440	3956440	Well, have you noticed Skittles coming out in a lot of flavors?
3956440	3957440	No.
3958440	3965440	I think that little piece of music, and I'm only half joking here because obviously I'm making a joke,
3965440	3969440	but that moment where we all laughed and clapped about doing that thing,
3969440	3972440	did we do it because we're sad? Yes.
3972440	3975440	And did it make us feel a lot better? Absolutely.
3975440	3980440	I think that little song we did softens my experience of the last week.
3981440	3987440	Well, actually, that reminds me, let's talk about the thing that was, oh, at least music will be better.
3987440	3989440	Of course, we've all heard that about comedy.
3989440	3992440	Oh, remember John Stewart during the Bush administration and all that stuff.
3992440	3994440	Let's talk about that for a second.
3994440	3997440	Does that, I mean, are we just turning that on like a faucet?
3997440	3999440	Because for me, it feels deeper.
3999440	4006440	Back then, I knew that we were in a war with Iraq that I didn't believe in and that shit was being told to me.
4007440	4009440	But I was also not into Al Gore.
4009440	4012440	I didn't think he was robbed, and I didn't care.
4012440	4014440	I thought all that shit was for chumps.
4014440	4019440	Is that just a part of being young, where you're like, fuck this whole system?
4019440	4024440	Yeah, you don't give a shit about shit until you own a house, and you're like, I'm paying taxes on this,
4024440	4027440	so I want those motherfuckers not to park right there.
4027440	4030440	So I want to pass a law to get those motherfuckers not to park right there.
4030440	4032440	And that's just part of getting older.
4032440	4033440	I think that's a huge part of it.
4033440	4034440	You don't know.
4034440	4035440	That's part of the middle class.
4035440	4042440	I think if you go from lower middle class to middle class, you become Republican with every fucking pebble in that path.
4042440	4050440	I think in L.A., we have a distorted vision of it because you can shoot up from lower middle class to the equivalent of upper class
4050440	4054440	and the whole time retain your, you're like, I'll give my gardeners a bonus.
4054440	4058440	But there's a Democratic version of Don't Park in front of my house.
4058440	4062440	Maybe it's a cigarette tax or it's something else.
4063440	4064440	This is what we saw.
4064440	4066440	We didn't know enough about each other.
4066440	4067440	We don't know enough about each other.
4067440	4072440	So if we had known more about each other, we might have respected rights of other people a little bit more.
4072440	4076440	And I think that part of it is age because when you're a kid, of course, you don't know shit.
4076440	4082440	But we kind of have to look at ourselves and say, we should have checked in on those people once they started closing those factories.
4082440	4084440	It doesn't mean that we owe them anything.
4084440	4087440	But we might have wanted to check on fellow Americans a little bit more.
4088440	4093440	That's a fantastic way of weaving those cones because I want to really respect the people.
4093440	4094440	I think Spencer's one of them.
4094440	4100440	And I think I've been really, I've never expressed it to Spencer, but it's like Spencer's a relatively young guy.
4100440	4104440	And it's like, this is a big election and Spencer's like, I watch what he retweets and stuff.
4104440	4108440	And I'm like, Spencer's on point and he's like fucking mad.
4108440	4112440	Like he's not, he's sick and tired of, correct me if I'm wrong.
4112440	4121440	You're sick and tired of the philosophy of like, oh God, see guys, like we shouldn't have ignored them.
4121440	4125440	You know, they have needs to don't forget to tolerate the intolerable.
4125440	4129440	I'm sorry. Don't forget to don't forget tolerance for the intolerant.
4129440	4130440	You're a little sick of that.
4130440	4134440	Like, well, it's I mean, we we've had polls.
4134440	4136440	We did polls before this election.
4136440	4143440	Half of respondents in these polls, half of Trump supporters were like, black people are more lazy and more violent than white people.
4143440	4146440	A third of Clinton supporters thought that.
4146440	4153440	So it's just like if you ask what their beliefs are, their beliefs are racist and they believe in people who they think can help.
4153440	4154440	But they're not going to help.
4154440	4155440	I'm they're not going to help them.
4155440	4157440	They're only going to help them if they think that.
4157440	4165440	Do you think that the racism that the blacks are the black thing about being lazy comes from the old slow wrapping back from the 80s.
4166440	4169440	It certainly isn't how we met each other.
4169440	4172440	Yeah. I can't even be bothered to rap fans.
4176440	4177440	So high.
4180440	4184440	I just I think it's part it's all everyone's you know, you kind of touch on it sometimes.
4184440	4188440	But it's like the word intersectionality gets at that.
4188440	4194440	There's this overarching oppressive system that tells white people that black people are taking their jobs and are causing the problems.
4194440	4197440	It tells men that women are, you know, not serious.
4197440	4201440	It tells poor or rich people that poor people are to be feared.
4201440	4208440	And it keeps us all complicit in kind of ignoring inequality that happens and ignoring that it's real and ignoring that it's dangerous.
4208440	4213440	And that apathy is why half of the eligible voters stayed home.
4213440	4218440	I mean, I think if they were more open to the real plight of people, they would say, we can't elect Hitler.
4218440	4219440	We have to get out there.
4219440	4222440	If you should have, you know, activated those people.
4222440	4223440	But we're still going to have to talk.
4223440	4226440	Yeah. No, we can't because we can't just say we can't just say, no, you're racist.
4226440	4228440	We have to say you're not racist.
4228440	4234440	But the way you act and the way you make decisions and policy choices is playing into the system that affects us all.
4234440	4235440	And it affects you.
4235440	4236440	And it makes it so you can't get what you want.
4236440	4238440	And it makes it so I can't get what I want.
4238440	4239440	And it kills people.
4239440	4244440	Right. So I think when you're in a drive through, this is unrelated.
4244440	4245440	I'm just so hungry.
4246440	4252440	I think when you're in a drive through like you're the position that you've been placed in before you start communicating.
4253440	4265440	With the other person has a huge impact on every aspect that it's like, oh, the person on the other side of the drive through speaker, they're speaking the same language as me.
4265440	4267440	The everything we're all in the same business.
4267440	4268440	It's McDonald's.
4268440	4271440	We all know one person wants a burger and how much it should cost.
4271440	4277440	And yet so much breakdown because of the position you've been placed in and the filter you're being placed on the other side of it.
4277440	4279440	So like, I don't know how to do this.
4279440	4282440	I don't know what the practical aspect of this is.
4282440	4291440	But I know that we're I know that we can't wait for three hundred million people to stop being fucking morons because the average IQ is one hundred.
4291440	4304440	And if we don't start if we don't start being comfortable with the idea that most of the people you meet, most of the people you love, most of the people that if you're in this city, you hope will one day worship you like like they're dumb.
4304440	4309440	They're dumb as a turd compared to Dan Harmon calls his fans dumb.
4310440	4312440	Like, like, like, like, but.
4312440	4313440	That's how we got here.
4313440	4318440	We're all smarter than termites, giraffes, baboons, rocks.
4318440	4321440	Did you lay off giraffes for one episode, man?
4321440	4324440	I'm not going to let them off the hook just because of this election.
4324440	4327440	Like they didn't come any closer to respect in my mind.
4328440	4339440	When you find yourself talking to a person and you start to hear them like bubble up or you start to feel yourself bubbling up like.
4340440	4342440	Can you identify the speaker between you?
4342440	4345440	Can you identify that you're at this drive through?
4345440	4355440	Can you because in real life getting out of your car accelerated makes it a horrible TMZ clip of like this person wanted his McNuggets so bad.
4356440	4357440	But we're not true.
4357440	4358440	There's no McNuggets.
4358440	4360440	Stop beating that metaphor.
4361440	4373440	When you are talking to a person over a wall and you feel like like there is something between you that can't change instead of focusing on the wall or even trying to talk over it.
4374440	4379440	Is there a position that both people can take relative to what you're trying to do?
4379440	4394440	Because what if both what are those people talking over the wall are talking about something over there like a giant Anthony Hopkins created a windmill machine that's going to create a canyon through the episode you're missing tonight.
4395440	4398440	Like what if you're both fucking robots?
4399440	4422440	Like you should both face the problem and you don't have to get over your differences because that person the differences might be that that person's fucking racist and that when they look at you they think that you're a worthless person and that goes back again to like I think the ladies learned this time around and Brandon's point is like yeah welcome to the fucking party.
4423440	4428440	Which is like the music is amazing you're going to love the music.
4430440	4451440	A lot of people got a big fat taste of holy shit for real not in a Facebook policeable way not in a are you being a little by my way not in any kind of like Kelly doesn't like you way not in a I'm not hanging out with him way not in any way that's defeatable by any of that shit.
4452440	4468440	In a very real way someone you might be talking to might be fucking just like looking at you and thinking that's a vagina that's a black person that's a white person that's a union person in my case and talk to union people yeah.
4469440	4472440	That is the props are electric.
4474440	4497440	The wall may be absolutely vile and may need to come down and maybe a huge part of a huge problem but but like it but how will you ever like yeah that's the big question is like can you can can we somehow concretize the practice of oh there's a wall okay well let's be better than.
4498440	4514440	Two ants with a difference between each other and like do this ritual where we rotate ninety degrees and we don't we'll get back to that wall that was fucking even more visible this way it's right there we can even see how long it is and where it came from I'm fucking nailing it now.
4515440	4540440	It what it connects to all the other walls and stuff but like the most important thing being like oh are we are we are we controlling ourselves or are we letting these walls because who who put them there but yeah that's what you have to have to reveal that stuff to people and it and I think there's this gap this disconnect because whenever I'm coming from a place it's it's from trying to help people and it's not always coming through but it's like.
4540440	4569440	But my understanding that I don't say is that you're you're focusing on issues of race is distracting you from the real problems that are affecting us all and as long as people ignore that ignore that disconnect we're not going to be on the same page but we have to say like no your problems are valid and they're real and they're part of this thing that I acknowledge and it's valid and it's in it's explainable by the system that also acknowledges that racism is a real thing that you're.
4570440	4576440	You should also acknowledge exists in the world and I'm not saying you're racist you know so like I don't know.
4576440	4579440	Yeah well no you're on it you're on it because that's not doing wrong.
4579440	4599440	Our demographic has been dismissing Asperger Reddit guys we're always saying to women and we're always going like like we're just shut up for a second I'm trying to explain the it's like we're like someone else someone will post a story about like I was in a parking lot and all this stuff happened and then like Spencer and me come from a world where we're like helping when we go.
4600440	4603440	Yeah but however you probably shouldn't assume that person.
4604440	4607440	And it's like and it's like you're anyways what were you gonna say.
4607440	4622440	I mean I like I just think that we're that no one's listening and I do think that there are deep seated issues in our country and it's I think it starts with our shitty education system and we go to I spent a lot of time in Appalachia and I don't know if anyone else has but like.
4623440	4633440	But like a lot of towns are derelict like they don't have money to even tear down buildings that that they don't know what to do with and then that they let like mountains just.
4634440	4651440	They don't even have funding for mountain clearing like you know we all believe that global warming is happening so like that's true and green energy is good yet they're huge industries that have relied on coal mining and just the in the mining.
4652440	4679440	Business and they now are losing jobs coal mining coal mining businesses have been like almost fully shut down and I mean not fully but they're everyone's losing jobs and then you lose jobs and then no one wants to be a teacher and no one gets paid no one can create a business because no one's gonna go out to a restaurant no one's gonna give their money there and then that and then now they're all pissed people have drug issues all over the country no one pays attention to it states have no tax revenue.
4679440	4692440	And we're just we're just there is this cycle and people are mad and Trump made those people feel special also as well as all the problems in the world he said he said he said how's everybody doing tonight to section C.
4692440	4716440	Lately lately and that was made a huge difference in the concert and they they came out and they voted and and I don't know if he's gonna fix their problems but it's really fucking sad and there is no alternative jobs for a lot of people who work in industries like that and I just I just think that we can there's a way that we can go into areas and not have a political agenda
4716440	4728440	and just understand okay so you have a father a grandfather who's been so angry for whatever reasons they didn't have an education but you know what you're the new generation let's figure out how to serve you better.
4728440	4742440	Let's figure out an education system that's that's better for you and then maybe we can even figure out a way for you to express yourself beyond school so you can talk about all this weird shit happening in your head or what you know JJ said to you or whatever.
4742440	4761440	Like there's just there's no like expression. Yeah. Make your kids less into multicam. Yeah. From a TV perspective it's just like tell tell them that tell them they have options like like there's like it's just like why would you want to hear other people laughing it's okay to just laugh at what you want to laugh at.
4761440	4784440	Right. And it seems like it's so mad about Big Bang Theory. I'm going to I'm going to grind every axe I can while I still have a chance. Paul Bunyan's dying. No but it's coming down from the generations and their parents and then you know if we want to change something it starts with educating young people and that's what Hillary Clinton was all about and we have a shitty fucking system in our in our country.
4784440	4814440	And I'm super proud of the fact that in California and Los Angeles is like these concentric strongholds of like you know we have like amazing like if we choose to volunteer in L.A. overflowing but we were talking about this and it's like I don't know I don't know this is the most dumbest thing I've ever said of the smartest thing but it's like oh people say white privilege and then your skin bristles but it's like oh what if it was actually privileged what if you could for instance what if you I know you would be allowed to walk into a steel mill and nobody's going to
4814440	4844440	be like hey who let scarlet witch in I've gone to so many homes so many steel mills coal mines name three they're all in West Virginia and I don't remember the taluska load the silly bust out this dead witch dragon no but that's yeah and that's so what it will what it would have been to them are you my ex-boyfriend's family was from or is from Kentucky I just been to them you don't you know like you're not like Princess Diana like going to them do you mind cold I've literally just hung out and then he he ended up making a
4844440	4874440	film in in West Virginia and I was going to these places where you know at first everyone who's working in these in these mines they feel with you coming in can't with cameras they're already assuming that you're coming in to make stock footage to make fun of them yeah they already think that so they're really defensive they just think oh you're gonna make us look stupid in this movie because I've been pitching every time one of these camera crews comes in I pitched my fucking show no one listens it's a good idea
4874440	4904440	it's about a guy who minds time you can't fucking tell me that's not a good idea but no I got suit all over my face so everyone's like look at the jackass what was it was the show called time miner you fucking faggot fucking big city faggot can I get back to work I'm sorry I'm sorry I didn't notice you were handicapped I'm sorry
4904440	4934440	I went to my lizzie we were you know I've been to Morgantown West Virginia that's what that's what the college is though right that's where the that's where the mountaineers are and like but I do comedy shows we will go to like like rural areas but we're usually around where the colleges are which tend to lean a little bit more liberal but but when you get slightly out of town you're in straight-up red state like real stuff and some of the coolest nicest funny
4934440	4964440	happiest people you'll ever meet a lot of people that I you know I tried to you know exercise this thing of I have these in my mind educated beliefs and trying to be patient and listen and all you can hear on the other end is they are shit out of luck right now like they don't have a lot to hold on to and that's all you can think about and you can't and you you don't you can't then label it as
4964440	4994440	stupid or ignorant it's just you also can't be like oh let's flood all of our passion into this ailing part of the country because every black woman that's not listening to this podcast because I have zero black women listeners because I've already oh Brandon let's show that footage of 13 black women watching dance on oh I thought I thought you just came out as trends we have to like we have to be like okay it was a terrible strategy for the Democrats to
4994440	5024440	ignore what would be really uncharismatic rightfully so uncharismatic to it would be a hard thing to be trying to get the Democratic vote and to be honest and practical if you were really also simultaneously in addition to trying to get the Democratic vote also trying to be honest and declare an agenda for change you're just shooting yourself in the foot standing up behind any podium during that
5024440	5054440	campaign and going and let's not forget the beleaguered honky oh languishing from his Bruce Springsteen factory somewhere out there wishing for more whiteness will he ever get what he deserves like that is a Republican that came to be a conservative thing it's like oh because those guys are fiscal conservatives which means they'll never get they'll never win democratically they have to attach that to a train with an engine
5054440	5084440	which is a lot of people who are scared of gay people scared of culture scared of and it's like it said that those lines get drawn then you have Democrats going oh so everyone that's that's working with a welding torch in their hand is a moron who hates gay people who's going to vote for George Bush or is living in a district that's going to go red anyway so fuck them and also what I'd lose 10 black votes even bothering to throw one of those
5084440	5114440	lumber fucking aside during any visit to anything because fuck that guy so what if they yeah and it's like this is why these lines like they have they have sucked us into a world wrestling like franchise they have told us there are good guys and there are bad guys it doesn't really matter who there's like it's linked to all kinds of visceral stuff there's an iron sheik and that's got all kinds of symbolic value but we all know we all celebrate on CNN and Fox News and it
5114440	5144440	doesn't matter who's in our living rooms we all know that they don't actually represent those things we all know that Donald Trump for instance does not work as a janitor he does not weld anything he's never successfully owned a business I won't I don't mean to get fucking controversial but and he's rapey but but but the but but we all know that he doesn't represent American value you know we even the people it's like we all know that politicians put on this show they're professional wrestlers
5144440	5174440	we go like oh well I don't expect Bill Clinton to say I believe women are the future and then go off and fondle not fondle them he's a politician he has to wear that blazer that comes with fondling women like we make allowances for these performers because we accept that they're engaged in chicanery we accept that we're idiots we sit there and we cheer for symbols we we we punish them for becoming real we find photos of them smoking joints in college and if that's not
5174440	5204440	that time then we go caught you you weren't Hulk Hogan your name was Terry like you can't be a wrestler anymore you didn't come out of your mother's womb and grab a lion like we know it's fake and then we insist and then we wonder why so we sit in this franchise but then the mind-blower is when though when people who go to professional wrestling and who like get to like fucking get some of their feelings out by yelling at
5204440	5234440	red guy versus blue guy in a ring they get to leave that venue get in their cars go home and decide how to watch television how to order popcorn do you order popcorn again out of touch how to how to interact with with how to leave a comment under your favorite or least favorite thing the reality that we're living in when you the metaphor I'm talking about is they won't we don't they're never gonna let us
5234440	5264440	we have to we have to leave the venue and it's not a physical venue but like we they won't they have it built around all of our lives we sleep and dream in it we some people here tonight I guarantee you because that election was so volatile so just it was such an event there are people here tonight who who are here with
5264440	5294440	like I bet 20% of people here tonight I like have like gotten in fights and like ended relationships the people in the wrestling ring go into the back room and they do cocaine and they're nuts shrivel up and they write books and they they don't sell and they're sad and then Mickey Rourke plays them in a movie and he even doesn't get an Oscar I mean I said this is like don't don't even don't even be mad at them they're just clowns we we just need to like like like that's all I'm waking up to is like who
5294440	5324440	really shit man cuz like like like is it like how do we get out of there and you get out of there like the moment you go like oh it's not real it's not real and I'm not saying don't vote vote for this crazy person right in your friend turn the pole over I don't I don't know man I just like we got nothing but time now to go okay so that happened that's like an ice pick that goes down the middle of this block and it's like fragmented and now it's all laid bare and there's chunks and all this shit be very
5324440	5354440	careful as we pick up each chunk or as we clean up all this stuff are we gonna do so
5354440	5384440	or took my heart out of my chest oh god damn it the black people are stealing hearts now or the horrible horrible story where I thought that black guy was gonna help me change my tire but he took my heart out of my chest I just don't want to hear a story where I got a job out of the shit I got sidetracked there because I got excited about a new thought about
5384440	5414440	but my what have I what have I learned since I saw you guys nothing I ever think politically is going to happen none of my predictions ever come true we can't keep expressing ourselves about injustice that we're reading about on Facebook and the Walmart's and the guys snatching those headscarves off and saying you can't you should hang yourself with us we it won't stop if we just
5414440	5444440	we should retweet it the retweet won't stop it it's all it's it wait we yeah it's it what it's like it's like it's fun Andy Kaufman knew that like a boo is like worth two laughs like it's it but it's that doesn't mean don't talk about it don't go numb I'm not telling you what to do I tell you what I'm telling myself to do don't go numb stop being surprised figure out what the fuck to do
5444440	5474440	like communicate with each other be honest about like if you perceive any division between you and another person that has nothing to do with what you know about them as an individual try just brave the lack of charisma that is well I think is it possible that the way we're talking to each other right now has something to do with the fact that you're a barista and I'm a customer because I don't fucking like I didn't buy a ticket to that I just want my coffee
5474440	5504440	no sorry bad example well that came off the rails pretty fast yeah yeah that wasn't Dan give us leadership tell us what to think I'm failing well I'll bet in to say that this is great this is great this election was so bad that it killed Leonard Leonard Cohen oh yes but happily Prince and Bowie weren't around to see this shit which is great like they got out with a getting was good don't love that there's a funny tweet I saw that somebody said like Leonard Cohen's in
5504440	5534440	heaven with Prince and Bowie now jamming out but it's awful cuz their styles are so incompatible it's there well Leonard Cohen said there's a crack there's a crack and everything that's how the light gets in so maybe maybe this is a crack in that it goes like this that quote was tight as fuck
5534440	5564440	with the minor the minor fall the major the major lift the baffled king composing well that is tonight what is that but it's the hook we've been moved it's also the title of the farm I know we've been we've been we've been we've been moving up we've been moving to the east side to a deluxe apartment in the sky when you get on
5564440	5594440	there I thought you could start doing a weird Gregorian champ there and someone tries to troll you by saying you're a piece of fucking shit fuck you you shouldn't say that tell them fuck you because I don't think that they came there to connect with you I think I think they came there to to like do that and they should just get that back and it shouldn't like you shouldn't also add a put a corkscrew in the pillow
5594440	5624440	and be like surprise motherfucker you should just be like fuck fuck you poop face just say fuck you poop face like like like don't be afraid don't like make it your mission to prove that they can't hurt you don't don't don't like like our enemy is gonna be dishonesty moving forward that's what those guys who poked Camille in the chest like how dishonest can you get the way when you need you when you need booze and a presence is
5624440	5654440	I don't like your politics and you're chanting like everything those guys said was a lie they came up and said they're big fans and then wanted to harass them they breathe lies like everything they do is a lie so they're in their own hell and like like we're gonna be fighting dishonesty don't frankly don't trust your friend just because they're spouting some shit that suggests that they're liberal actually have a conversation the secret that's what friendships about like just ask
5654440	5684440	just find a Russian to go through your friends emails and find out exactly and confess your own shit and say like hey we're best friends we we've been pretty much resigned the idea that we're liberal and we hate racism and xenophobia is bad but but you you use the n-word a lot when you're freestyling alone in your kitchen right yes yes I do do you are you I do you want my permission I can't give you my permission have that conversation
5684440	5711740	with you and oh really you you can give out the permission I said I said I said get that permission from yourself or your friend your black friend no your regime is over I just told you don't you understand when I talk to you sorry Brandon Brandon you're not content with eight years of black people ruling the world
5714440	5744220	we've tried to help you the health care the health care as soon as soon as these guys get in the White House they're gonna repeal okay all right whoops Lizzie I'm guessing that you were a Hillary supporter right yeah were you hardcore are you were you like oh yeah I mean hardcore with my community of friends and family what do you think the future for like the next time a woman
5744220	5773760	runs for president is because like you know like our I may be wrong when I say that I think our country is more sexist and racist and lots of ways that we let we let freed black people black men vote before women before but there's there's there's there's both and there's the the misogyny is a huge is a huge thing here like I I don't know it's not my place to say but I feel that there was a huge anti-women thing going on in this whole thing
5773760	5803740	but we certainly will go kicking and screaming into letting a woman run our country I mean it was definitely weird that the entire election came down to like three perverts like it was just a conversation about like Trump grabbing pussy bill having this affair and then Anthony Weiner showed up and and it was just all about three men in power who like who was the worst or evil of sexually offending women
5803760	5833740	I just thought that was so weird yeah and that was two weeks before like before we voted it's just strange I mean I I personally I you know I grew up in LA I'm from LA I feel very lucky with like what I've been able to do and I I I don't feel it as as me like not like I can't speak for other people I I I don't feel that I see racism more than I see sexism in my life but I mean I don't
5833740	5863720	I don't know what that means yeah but I mean like I don't with me I don't I mean that's just my personal experience I mean I'm sure every single person here has like a thousand personal experiences I mean it's oh well it's hard you don't because it's like when that those results came in I was like oh like oh because we sleep with them like I was like like wait but don't they sleep with you too well that's the thing it's like don't say I mean you you're allowed to go yeah
5863720	5891420	but I don't know it wasn't like oh I didn't know that they were also sleeping with me I'm talking about like it's this irony that we always point to where we're like man yeah and like yes like we're so misogynist that we in the list of amendments when you look at the history of our Constitution the virus that is our country that we hope infects the planet and the universe because it's that or Putin am I right
5892120	5921400	the its sequence of DNA when you backtrack through it because it's there's a paper trail we we we got woke about the idea that some people aren't animals before we decided women should participate in the election and we were married to them before that we were married to them so so like I that's that is the crazy thing to me which also is an uplifting thing because it further suggests yeah these lines there's so much
5921400	5951400	deeper than you would ever that you can't see the right ones when you focus on the ones you can see and people will use the the ones you can see as a distraction from the ones you can't and it's like that we are eight billion strong like we we have we have come to this point where we are elbow to elbow competing for oxygen with each other which is supposed to be a crisis so some of us are all thinking about I think instinctively like rats how do I get rid of the wrong ones how do I get
5951400	5974140	some space how do I get the brown ones back out of here maybe that gimmick worked when we were trying to build things but they got to go like I need some space I think we're just reacting like insects are rats to the idea it's not even like we experience it regularly where we're like I can't get into this Starbucks overpopulation it's like that's lunch hour it's like Starbucks needs to get its shit together
5974140	6003900	the the the the I think that eight billion people going like this and being like hi how are you hi Dan Harmon nice to meet you I remember you from the Marvel movie oh hey how are you Brandon get to see again that we're all rubbing up against each other that is an invitation to like go granular we keep looking at it as like man more now more than ever we really need to categorize ourselves there's so many people and we're so squished together
6003900	6033780	we gotta figure out okay so they're and it's like it's now it's and now it's going to Europe and now you know France is probably everyone's like scared of globalization everyone's scared of the other everyone's scared of anyone coming in this is a repeat of the of the things leading up to more scary than World War Two World War One where isolationism empty factories economies in the toilet everybody's starting to go I'm gonna stack weapons you guys stacking weapons everything starts internationally fucking machismo total cool like a billiard table
6034300	6063540	you bros gonna stack weapons stop doing trade yeah gotcha man like next game and it's like fucking like tanks bombs thick and everybody's like mmm it's World War One scarier than World War Two and that's the like a lot of that shit's leading to now but however here's the thing America during World War Two because it was so historically wounded by World War One it
6063940	6085860	like it was like another one ah and that led to like this rugged sad lonely angry like like kind of hunched over dude who was like look nazi shmazi all I see is a bunch of boats and a bunch of guns you want some metal you want some oil cash only I don't know I'm not taking credit
6085860	6115740	because one of you might take over the world and the other one's not gonna pay their bill and we were at that moment in my opinion just as a student of history it's like like I love that I love that America I love that poor wounded child that just wants to make money and profit off both sides of a huge genocidal that just that thought that those oceans meant something that big before it went on to invent those oceans not meeting anything
6115740	6116740	with all of its innovation and all of its greed and all of its self-indulgence we're a we're a genius self-indulgent child locked in its bedroom like so tired of the yelling and then and then getting getting roped into more of it and then we go at our puberty at World War Two we go well what's in it for us because we were tired of being you know like like we've had the right idea the whole time and you guys are just fucking around with us now and we got dragged into this before so give me some money give me some money and then we jump in and then we
6145740	6175740	get the thing and then we go all right fuck you Nazis you're dead you're dead you're dead let's get these filing cabinets out of here whoa this drawer came open shit these guys were nailing it their overhead was zero and their profit was a thousand percent because they were Nazis maybe we should bring this back overseas everything went to shit that's a that's a fucking Alex Jones tangent that I don't want to I can't the the the there is hope there is hope we don't have to repeat history
6175740	6205740	we don't have to do it we are living in the exact circumstances there's like a little bit of World War One there's a little bit of World War Two these things building up yeah and America fascism is on the rise globally right America has always been in these little stories well because we learned from American history books but we're the star we we are we have a certain position I think Portugal is going to come back good and strong I we might be the ones this time to say
6205740	6225960	I see more profit in not war these bombs don't know I don't think that's going to I think I think what if you draw a line from the beginning of empires to now empires get big and they decline and they die really ignominious deaths and someone else takes over.
6235740	6265740	I would like to see your math on that one no it's a new age sir I don't like you're saying that dinosaurs ate the ostracism became ostriches saying there's little details that can be different like like we we might be able to be counted on as being the cell but they're not we're ancient Rome right now we're exactly the way that Spain fell like when you pull so far back that you would
6265740	6295740	acknowledge that the pattern is that things get big and then they fart like that's not brave to point out can we can we stop talking about you for one second it seems like the difference in this case is that we can get together I it's not it's not it's not as easy to say oh oh look America's showing all the signs of a big global empire that's about to blow it like it doesn't like it doesn't have to just be resigned to certainly not but like
6295740	6325740	I don't think any empire ever thought they were resigning to a fate I think they always thought that that was going to last a thousand years or or ten thousand years I draw a circle around your circle I'm just saying like I draw triangle inside my circle people keep people keep trying to learn from history and not learning from history and people I'm saying like like it's not we don't even know it's like the the empires that were describing like we you're you're we're adjusting for inflation and going like well it's been 300 years for America like maybe we're supposed to become a
6325740	6355740	planet by now and it's supposed to be the planet that burns up into a cinder because that was a shitty empire and it turns out the bees were writing the history books and I just have like one picture and it's just Michael Jackson that's our whole species they're like the book isn't even a book it's just like a series of like things that emulate a thorax wiggle and when you but when you read it it's like a like a yeah it's an image it's the essence of Michael Jackson's pheromone
6355740	6385740	and only Jody Foster can translate it yeah but she's gone because we didn't believe in ourselves which is what I think we need to do Jody Foster's dead we're all dead it's just the bees now you don't even have to be an optimist to start trying to organize your little corner of the world for the right because if you're a pessimist follow that all the way through oh yeah the world's fucked it's the Wild West any minute now I'm
6385740	6415740	I might turn out to be a robot a guy I'll find out when I get a bullet in my head like like therefore obviously then don't die a douche like go down swinging if a if a Nazis gonna kill you I'm gonna I'm learning how to wrap barbed wire around a two by four and later I'm gonna I'm gonna learn how to lift it but but I'm hoping that when they get there I'm gonna go guys look look what I can do you guys get
6415740	6445740	you got Nazi work to do I got I'm your man they call me Barbie Barbie to buy show me to your ammo dump let me show you what I can do when I got some real resources and then I get in there and I go full fucking homeland how do you how do you connect when you find I'm assuming you just scrounged your barbed wire and your two by four but how do you connect the barbed wire onto the end of the two by four well it's
6445740	6475740	Dan Harmon the teeth sink into the wood as you wrap it around you just have to wear really thick gloves the trick isn't to figure out how to attach barbed wire to wood but barbed wire is effective because it'll go through anything you hand it that's why you need you need to work with baseball gloves all of it's available for Amazon I'm not here to do like an anarchist cookbook you have you you're gonna find a couple baseball gloves everything that you guys need to know about my political police as a
6475740	6503460	this election can be heard in the Mike and the mechanic song silent running go home and listen to it pledge allegiance to the flag whatever flag they offer good song good song just guys did you really did you did you know her I think we just got a guy back that likes blondie a lot yeah yeah you're
6503460	6532780	blondie is attention and these people have been they have blondies my blondie is being a handicap person that have been a big joke tonight but I guess I guess I guess walks a lot can talk for I met a friend who's name is Sylvan he's from Paris met him today he reminded me that today is the one today is the one-year anniversary of the Paris attacks
6532780	6562580	and he's not traveling the states by himself right now cruising around and he couldn't have picked a more fun week to be well also you're worried in is it in France what's going on where there's like white net or not white net there's like rate racial nationalism like popping up all over the globe is it in France because all of us in America are going France is fancy they'd never go Nazi that's how young we are
6562580	6592540	no things are getting weirder since the last year I don't know if there are more races but there are more ways for them to express their racism I guess and we have an addiction in one year so politicians are being politicians I guess but yeah so it's getting pretty weird and I guess with this direction we feel I mean from the social media today like I I guess yeah we weren't expecting that results from the US and then it
6592660	6622460	kind of scare everybody because everybody is like hey we shouldn't like do that next year but it's getting maybe I don't think we're gonna elect somebody that that is as maybe obviously racist than yours but but it would be the same like maybe we have different codes so you can not say the same things but doesn't mean that the people don't really think the same so and it's yeah I think it's pretty much the same like in Paris you don't I guess
6622460	6652460	feel it as much as in LA or San Francisco or like New York but then you yeah you have to have this big of an event to realize what's going on and we're living in this world like I don't know how old you are but all of us really I'm always talking about oh you're 25 I'm 45 like all of us can be grouped into one group of people who all of the kind of shit that we're thinking about right now all of us thought of it as something from history books like we all watched we all looked at
6652460	6668900	pictures of it and there's something a little exciting about that for mostly straight white dudes who love sliders which is because it's like we're oh we're in a sliders anyways thank you thank you thank you Frenchie that was nice
