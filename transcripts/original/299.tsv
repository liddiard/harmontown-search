0	25040	Tasting, tasting. Hello gang, how's all things going out there? Alright. Who has some sidewalk
25040	33680	chocolate? Alright. Did I hear a yup from Dave Klein out there? Can we get a yup, a
33680	48640	universal yup? I think we're ready to go. Hello, my name is Jeff Brian Davis. I'm very
48640	53600	happy to be back comtrolling. I know that we all love Brandon Johnson, but his reign
53600	63040	of terror is over. It's my honor to announce once again from beautiful MacArthur Park,
63040	83080	Los Angeles, Harmon Town is now in session. Spencer Crittenden, the game master extraordinaire.
83080	89320	Did he get thinner, or is he farther away from me right now? Both. Did you get sexy
89320	95320	candles? Oh yeah. I love it. Why don't we bring out, just for good fun, a mayor. Let's
95320	119400	call him Dan Harmon. Thank you. Jeff Davis, re-voiced. Re-voiced. I can talk again. Yeah.
119400	126840	Re-voiced. Moist. The larynx is re-moist. Moist. Maybe I can rap with you. Maybe you
126840	137960	can sing a tune. Maybe I can pee and poop. Maybe I can get a harpoon. Am I a whale? Yes.
137960	146800	And I'm a whaler. Riding on my ship. There she blows. It turns out, it took three months
146800	156200	to find out you and I are bad at improv. I'm with the show. Okay. Not like we're gonna
156200	164960	hurt you. Welcome back, everybody. It's good to see you all. I gotta miss you some. Do
164960	171400	you now have, are you like when our friends have quadruple bypasses and they're like secretly,
171400	176040	they're like, I can eat anything now. I think I'm probably one and a half weeks away from
176040	183200	being full like stage voice, but I get to go, ha, I can do that now. And who didn't
183200	189600	miss me going, ha, that's the best part of everything. You can't do karaoke yet. I could,
189600	196840	but I shouldn't. Right. Wait, wait. What you got? Well, you could do, you could do like
196840	203600	George Michael, but not Neil Diamond. No, I could do Neil Diamond. You can't, no. George
203600	208120	Michael, like, well, you can do just certain parts of George Michael. Well, I guess it
208120	214080	would be nice if I could touch your body. That's like nice and easy. Just give me some
214080	221600	hot tea and I know not everybody. That's because you're a tenor. I'm a baritone. I can go,
221600	228320	money talks. I can sing in the baritone. You sing more in a tenor, even though you look
228320	236360	like Pavarotti. No, but he's a tenor. So yeah, there you are. Yeah. What is a tenor?
236360	248120	So it goes all the way up to 11ers or what is the? It doesn't get any better. There's
248120	252600	nothing written. So actually you should be impressed by that. I'm not saying you have
252600	257880	to be. It's just like, if you're not, it's going to be a long night. But what key do you
257880	264400	think, I'm not going to play it so we don't get in trouble. What key do you think Father
264400	269040	Figure is in? I don't know. Just like sing it. I don't know keys. I don't know keys.
269040	278080	Oh, yeah. Just start singing like whatever. That's all I wanted. Something sacred, something
278080	292920	special in your life for just one moment just to be your baby. I don't know. Is that
292920	302760	an E? Is that an E sharp? That's totally E sharp. Is it D? Or is it F? It might be F.
302760	309120	I know it's A through F. See, I have a thing. My doctor told me that I have to do a thing
309120	316840	every day called the swelling test where I have a piano keyboard and I play a note and
316840	324760	I have to find my ceiling. And if I lose my ceiling by half a step, be quiet for a day.
324760	330800	If I lose my ceiling by a whole step, call her because something bad's happening. But
330920	338640	when she first gave it to me, it was G sharp four in the fourth octave. I'm now C five.
338640	346840	That's a fucking big jump. I don't know. Dave Klein knows. Dave Klein comes from a family
346840	358280	of... Dave, can you give me a youp and C four? It's a C five. That was F and you're being
358280	366560	a bully. Okay. I have a question. He comes from two opera singers. I have some questions.
366560	373800	When you get your green screen elliptical, then Dave Klein is wearing a t-shirt and he's
373800	379400	got the... What do you call those? Kettlebells? Kettlebells. What are you doing, Dave? You're
379400	385120	lifting kettlebells. This guy's working his ass off and you're just going, yup, yup. That's
385120	395520	not hard. That's harder. Okay. All right. That scans. That scans. Dave, do you want
395520	409560	to come up and talk about the workout? That's good. Dave Klein up here, everybody. I just
409560	414720	want to narrate that Jeff went for two power moves and was out power moved both times by
414720	422800	Dave Klein. How's it impressive? Good to see you. Thanks for coming on stage. Am I becoming
422800	427320	the fat guy in Hermitown? Everybody now is fucking fit as a fiddle. I know what the audience
427320	432280	is thinking. You didn't have to introduce. Dave, we can tell from looking at him that
432280	442840	he's the sculptor of your body. You scream personal trainer. He also screams shampoo
442840	448680	and conditioner. This guy's hair is fucking magnificent. Look, I got a pretty serious
448680	456000	athletic background. I'm formally trained in the art of yoga. I got a 200 hour certification
456000	462880	with the National Yoga Alliance through YogaWorks. Shout out to YogaWorks. I also have an illustrious
462880	470000	swimming career, former state champion, New Jersey representative of the USA Zone competition,
470000	478600	Columbia division one swim program, NCAA, YMCA national championship qualifier. Let's
478600	485440	go. I'm also pretty nasty on a pickup basketball court. I know it's a podcast. It probably
485440	489960	isn't podcast gold, but could you do a little exercise for us and show us, like teach us
489960	496200	one exercise? Sure. This is a classic exercise that comes from, I think, I don't know. I
496200	501120	think the punk movement really kind of got it down right, but what I think physiology
501120	505840	is all about is movement, power, spirit, and linking your energy, mind, and physiology
505840	510920	into a reality that you're comfortable with. I miss this show so much. I'm so happy.
510920	516120	What I'm going to give to you, one of my favorite exercises that's ever been done. It's got
516120	521280	a shamanic element. It's got a lot of cardio. Should the whole audience get up and try this
521280	526320	with us or is it? Oh, I totally, totally encourage. Bring up as many people as you
526320	532400	think should get on stage right now to do this with us. If I can get just seven volunteers,
532400	540920	seven's a good number. One, two, three, four, five. Also, if you got your hand up, get up
540920	546400	here, get out of here. Come on up here. Now I'm going to give you an exercise that's not
546400	554600	a traditional yoga element. It's a little bit sped up. My name's Dave. It's nice to
554600	557880	meet you. My name is Dave. It's nice to meet you. My name is Dave. It's real nice to meet
557880	561720	you. My name is Dave. It's nice to meet you. Shout out to the Guardians. I love that. Shout
561720	564920	out Dave Klein. Dave Klein. Dave Klein, nice to meet you.
564920	572800	Did we get anybody that's not in the alt right? I don't know. I don't know. We've got
572800	578360	all of 4chan up here. Let's curve this around. Let's curve out the demographics. Okay. All
578360	583080	right. I didn't see to the end. Hello ladies. We've got some lady exercise. All right. Now
583080	588440	you're going to want to stagger yourself. So one step back, one step forward. All right.
588440	594520	All right. Now we're going to start out slow because of the music. 4chan workout. All right.
594520	603080	We're going to start with your hands up right here. Now you're going to shake it on down.
603080	618160	Bring it up halfway. Bring it on back down. Back up. Back down. Halfway on up. Now we're
618160	631280	going to link the breath in. Exhale down. Inhale with your arms up now and down. Exhale. Halfway
631280	644760	up. Inhale down. Exhale. Lift it on back up. Up. Up. Up. Inhale. Hold. Hold. Break it on down.
644760	649400	Freestyle. Breathe however you want on this freestyle because I'm going to introduce you.
649400	657400	Let's share it for our freestyle yoga experts. Thank you. All right. Now we're going to speed
657400	662120	it up a little bit. We got anything a little bit faster? Because what I wanted to do is a cardio
662120	666120	movement from kind of the punk era. We're going to do some head bang. Wait, weren't you just telling
666120	672480	us? We're going to head bang. That was what we were learning. Okay. All right. Now that movement we
672480	677680	just did is an integral part of yoga. It's the beginning of the sun salutation. All right. But
677680	685920	now we're going to speed it up. Thrash, metal, long hair, furious energetics. All right. Yo, yo, but
685920	689760	you know what you are going to do? You're going to get all the blood in your heart to come up to
689760	697040	your noggin into your brain. We're going to head bang right now. All right. It's the same motion
697040	703360	as yoga, just a little faster with a different fucking energetic. So let's take a couple breaths
703360	716720	of fire. All right. Take a nice deep inhale. Exhale in like 10 first. Inhale. Ten short.
719680	724000	That's right. All right. We're getting the energetic going. It starts lighting the fire inside.
724000	729600	Same movement. I'm going to demonstrate where we're going with this. Now it's going to be a little bit faster.
740160	741520	Now that seems dangerous.
745200	747360	I guess they're opting out. They're opting out.
747360	758160	Most of them have have contacts. And we're going to finish out as we do any good yoga practice
758960	768720	with a cool down. Take a nice deep breath in for three. Hold for three. Nice exhale out.
768720	779360	Look, this world, there's a lot going on energetically, politically, personally, you know,
779360	785040	who knows. I got friends with financial problems that come into a yoga studio. They say what I need
786480	792960	is to just lay down. So here's what you need to do. Lay on down. This is a classic yoga pose called
792960	802400	savasana aka corpse pose. Corpse pose. They got names. You're going to lay your hands down. All
802400	809600	right. And now you got a choice here. If you put your palms down on the ground, you're kind of a
809600	815120	closed circuit and you're just kind of staying in your own zone and getting getting your your
815120	825200	energetics kind of properly orbiting your spirit. All right. But on the other hand, come on, orbit
825200	833680	that spirit. You want to receive it. Orbit. You want to watch these. You're not orbiting. No, no,
833680	838720	but seriously, on the real, if you want to receive a little bit of an energetic from the universe,
838720	845440	palms up. That's all. You have a choice. No, no, but on the ground, on the ground. So legs out straight,
845440	854000	everybody. Legs out straight, palms up, and just do three nice browns of four count in, four count
854000	863600	whole, four count out. That's it. Just three of them. All right. Well, in the meantime, Dan,
863600	868560	how you doing? I'm good. I'm good. Thank you. For the folks at home, exercise has been happening.
868560	874960	Yeah. Oh yeah. You might want to rewind mute the volume and just think about me undies for three
874960	882560	minutes. That's fair. They make a nice undergarment and socks and now onesies. But also think about
882560	888800	subscribing to the video version of the podcast because you could be looking at people laying down.
888800	893440	That's right. All right. And when you're, when you're all done, when you're all done, you can
893440	899600	bring your knees up to the sky. You can bring yourself up to a seated position. You can gently
899600	906640	rise up with this newly energized spirit. You guys were phenomenal. I got to thank you for your
906640	912240	positivity and going along with a maniacal session. Let's hear for Dave Klein and the freestyle yoga
912240	917760	section and the solid gold yoga dancers. Everybody let's hear from all right. Everybody get off the
917760	923920	stage. Let's hear from you guys did fantastic. Thank you, Dave. I'm not sure what we accomplished,
923920	937360	but I'm sure it was important. Well, yoga. Yeah. All right. Uh, yeah. I mean, I, so that's,
937360	940480	that's what you do every morning. I'm going to, yeah. And I'm going to try not to be phased by
940480	944240	the fact that I thought he meant it when he was saying all that stuff to me all the time,
944480	950000	that I was amazing and doing a great job. We just said that to a bunch of strangers. You know,
950000	953920	these are non-performers that just got up on a stage, did a weird thing and didn't even ask
953920	958880	any questions and were pretty good sports about it. That's pretty amazing. Well, but they didn't
958880	966480	work as hard as I do. And yo, who wants to see how hard he works? We got it. We can't,
966480	971840	I'm not trying to get out of it. We can't keep the, let's see how hard Dan Harmon works every day
972400	979680	with Dave Kline. I got to count. There's people listening to the podcast. We have to say things.
979680	981280	I'm going to say, I'm going to say it real fast.
984720	989120	Now I can't, you want, you want, they don't want to watch me plank on my elbows.
994560	997760	And they don't want to see you take your shirt off before you do it.
997760	1014560	All the way, all the way. I wanted you to see my Minecraft.
1027760	1048960	Body by Klein. He's so much skinnier. That's crazy. You do you want to call out any other
1048960	1052400	podcaster right now, like threaten them, like, like, like a wrestler.
1056320	1058160	Just Chris Pratt coming for you. Chris Pratt.
1070400	1074400	He's doing it. He's blanking. This is a full plate.
1079680	1082960	He's drinking alcohol while planking. Oh my God.
1086080	1087280	He's drinking again.
1087280	1093840	While playing, and the crowd are loving it.
1097280	1100320	Jeff moved the alcohol.
1109200	1114320	He's going for another drink. Oh, he's losing it, but he's maintaining.
1117280	1127200	90 7 entire 24 support, 23 for theesh with 25.
1127200	1155680	Oh Jeff put a drink on his back, this is a type of torture, this is what murderers do
1155680	1156680	to their victims.
1156680	1161680	Yeah, 30-30-12-19-6, 5-3-3-3-9, 30-30-12-19-7, 5-3-3-4-8, 40!
1161680	1162680	Yeah!
1162680	1163680	40!
1163680	1164680	Personal record!
1164680	1165680	Oh yeah!
1165680	1170680	With flourishes, with vodka flourishes.
1170680	1176680	He deals triumphantly as if getting ready to masturbate.
1176680	1181680	You did it!
1181680	1182680	Yeah!
1182680	1186680	Coming for you Chris Pratt.
1186680	1187680	You!
1187680	1188680	Yeah!
1188680	1194680	I didn't really mean for you to take your shirt off.
1194680	1197680	I was just doing a bit.
1197680	1198680	I did.
1198680	1199680	No, I know.
1199680	1202680	You didn't say it though, I did.
1202680	1205680	No, when I say it, no that was fucking outstanding.
1205680	1206680	That was amazing.
1206680	1208680	That was actually outstanding and amazing.
1208680	1209680	Fucking great effort on that.
1209680	1213680	But see, doesn't that sound the same as when he sent it to those other people?
1213680	1215680	That's similar enough.
1215680	1218680	For me, it was worth losing my voice just to see that.
1218680	1219680	Oh yeah.
1219680	1220680	Oh man.
1220680	1221680	I had to go into a dark place.
1221680	1223680	You got to do a swelling test.
1223680	1225680	You got to go do a swelling test.
1225680	1226680	I do every day.
1226680	1227680	Right now.
1227680	1230680	Play a C5.
1230680	1231680	Anybody have a...
1231680	1233680	Who has a pitch pipe?
1233680	1234680	I think Dave's got it.
1234680	1235680	Can you send for...
1235680	1237680	I have to do every day.
1238680	1239680	I have to hit my C5.
1244680	1245680	Yeah, you're still there.
1245680	1246680	You're still there.
1246680	1247680	Happy birthday.
1247680	1248680	Happy birthday.
1248680	1249680	I think it's...
1249680	1250680	I think it's like...
1250680	1251680	I think it's that C5.
1251680	1252680	Yeah.
1252680	1254680	I went to the desert with Cody to...
1254680	1255680	He knows.
1255680	1257680	Do you have a perfect pitch?
1257680	1259680	Sing a C5 for me.
1259680	1262680	That's just what Jeff was doing.
1262680	1264680	Do you really have perfect pitch?
1264680	1267680	You have really good relative or shitty perfect pitch.
1267680	1270680	Well, relative to and not you've recently heard.
1270680	1272680	That's the same thing, but you have perfect pitch.
1272680	1274680	Relative to perfect pitch.
1274680	1276680	Now, what's the highest note you can hit?
1276680	1277680	It depends on the day.
1277680	1280680	Well, today is the day, Jack.
1281680	1283680	That's definitely an F5.
1283680	1284680	C6.
1284680	1285680	Oh.
1285680	1286680	There's an octave above that.
1286680	1287680	Hit it again.
1287680	1288680	Hit it again.
1292680	1295680	That's terrifying and amazing at the same time.
1298680	1300680	Should we bring out Rob Schwab?
1307680	1310680	Rob Schwab about to come on stage.
1310680	1313680	Or maybe Rob Schwab taking a shift.
1313680	1315680	He's certainly doing some tricks.
1315680	1316680	Yeah.
1316680	1317680	Why has he been so shy?
1317680	1318680	He is normally...
1318680	1320680	Let me tell you a quick story.
1322680	1325680	Steve Levy and Rob Schwab at the same time.
1326680	1328680	That was the trick.
1330680	1331680	Yep.
1331680	1332680	I'm good.
1332680	1333680	Thank you.
1333680	1334680	Forget about Levy.
1334680	1336680	Forget about Stevie.
1338680	1339680	All right.
1339680	1341680	I don't know if I was meant to come out on stage.
1341680	1342680	It's kind of cold.
1342680	1343680	But you did?
1343680	1344680	Well...
1344680	1345680	Okay.
1345680	1346680	All right.
1346680	1347680	Knock it off.
1347680	1348680	Everybody clean it up.
1348680	1349680	Clean up the show.
1349680	1350680	Come on.
1350680	1351680	All right.
1351680	1352680	All right.
1352680	1353680	Come on.
1353680	1354680	Sorry, Steve.
1354680	1355680	Shape a show.
1355680	1356680	Let's get some craft going on here.
1356680	1357680	What's...
1357680	1358680	Let me tell you a story.
1358680	1360680	I went to the desert with Cody.
1360680	1362680	Story time!
1365680	1366680	Story time.
1367680	1368680	Story time.
1369680	1370680	Dance.
1371680	1372680	Story time.
1373680	1375680	He's going to tell us a story.
1375680	1377680	He's going to knit a yarn.
1378680	1386680	And this kid came out from the kitchen to serve us our food, bringing the food to the table.
1386680	1389680	And he was very bashful.
1389680	1392680	And he said, here you go.
1392680	1393680	Careful.
1393680	1394680	It's a hot plate.
1394680	1399680	Mr. Harmon, serving you has been my birthday.
1399680	1407680	And I said, oh, is it your birthday?
1407680	1410680	And he said, yes, today's my birthday.
1410680	1417680	And I was like, I wanted to say, well, technically, that's not a compliment.
1417680	1419680	You could hate me in serving you.
1419680	1422680	Like, it would be better if it wasn't...
1422680	1424680	Like, he should have said, it is now.
1424680	1425680	But it was his birthday.
1425680	1426680	That's the implication.
1426680	1428680	Serving you has been my birthday.
1428680	1431680	Did you put him on blast?
1431680	1432680	Yeah.
1432680	1433680	Like, for doing that?
1433680	1434680	Yeah, yeah.
1434680	1442680	I went back through his Twitter 10 years and I found some jokes about Monica Lewinsky
1442680	1448680	that were pretty cum-oriented, which is not really what's in right now.
1448680	1451680	Was that kid James Gunn?
1451680	1454680	Yes, that kid was James Gunn.
1454680	1456680	When you say a kid, how old?
1456680	1457680	Like, a teenager?
1457680	1458680	I don't know.
1458680	1459680	I mean, I'm 45.
1459680	1460680	Everyone's a kid.
1460680	1464680	Only people that aren't kids are in a space station dying.
1464680	1469680	Spencer, why don't you play us something?
1469680	1470680	Hey.
1470680	1472680	On the piano.
1472680	1474680	I'll tell you another story.
1474680	1476680	That's not really a story.
1476680	1479680	It's another funny thing I wrote down that someone said.
1479680	1485680	I was watching a true crime show and one of the people said,
1486680	1489680	one of those things where there's a cop trying to,
1489680	1495680	the cops are trying to, you know, they're trying to sound hard-boiled.
1495680	1498680	And the guy said,
1498680	1503680	it's like finding a needle in a basket of haystacks.
1503680	1504680	And he's like, I don't know.
1504680	1506680	That sounds like it might be easier.
1506680	1509680	That metaphor needed punching up.
1509680	1512680	He solved the crime of metaphors.
1512680	1516680	He's just miniaturizing haystacks to the point where a bunch of them fit in a basket.
1516680	1518680	Isn't that just a basket of hay?
1518680	1519680	It's a hay basket.
1519680	1523680	I'd rather find a needle in a basket of hay than a haystack.
1523680	1528680	Well, that phrase must have been invented before magnets, right?
1528680	1529680	Magnets?
1529680	1530680	Yeah.
1530680	1531680	Oh, right.
1531680	1533680	Pretty easy.
1533680	1536680	Before magnets that are powerful enough to suck a needle out of them.
1536680	1539680	High fives are being exchanged.
1542680	1544680	And that's not the sound of two high fives.
1544680	1548680	He had two mics up to one high five.
1548680	1550680	And that's not the sound of four high fives.
1550680	1551680	That's four mics.
1551680	1552680	Ow!
1552680	1553680	Ow!
1553680	1554680	Too hard.
1554680	1555680	You know how you do it?
1555680	1557680	You aim for the other person's elbow.
1557680	1558680	Okay.
1558680	1564680	Yeah, you got to make eye contact with their elbow.
1564680	1565680	I guess it's a bad trick.
1565680	1566680	Yeah, that works.
1566680	1568680	I don't really have anything else.
1568680	1569680	Those are the two things.
1570680	1573680	Yo, what about Novol...
1573680	1574680	Yeah!
1574680	1576680	What do you think is easier, Dan?
1576680	1581680	Finding a needle in a haystack or finding a needle in a basket of haystacks?
1581680	1584680	Honestly, I mean, what if it was their first time here?
1584680	1586680	I'll tell you what.
1586680	1593680	You've been doing some interesting delvings into the thinking about the history and future
1593680	1594680	history of humanity.
1594680	1598680	Shout out to you, Novol, Harari, author of Sapiens and Homo Deus.
1598680	1600680	We're getting deep into this shit in the mornings.
1600680	1602680	What were you saying?
1602680	1606680	All the aerobics I was just hearing on the speaker like going,
1606680	1608680	We have to say things.
1608680	1610680	It's a podcast.
1610680	1611680	Come on, people.
1611680	1613680	We have to say things.
1613680	1615680	It's a podcast.
1615680	1616680	Stop it.
1616680	1619680	We have to say things.
1619680	1621680	It's a podcast.
1621680	1623680	Yeah, I said that.
1623680	1625680	People, it's a podcast.
1625680	1626680	We have to say things.
1626680	1628680	There's some hips on this, too.
1628680	1630680	Come on.
1630680	1632680	Stop with this.
1632680	1634680	We have to say things.
1634680	1636680	Come on.
1636680	1639680	Yeah, I did read this book, Homo Deus.
1639680	1642680	Homo Deus, Homo Deus, Homo Deus.
1642680	1644680	Sorry, that's how you can remember it.
1644680	1645680	That's good.
1645680	1649680	By the author of Sapiens, I was talking about the book Sapiens last time.
1650680	1654680	This is a 2016 follow-up, I think, Homo Deus.
1654680	1657680	It's talking about what's to become of us.
1657680	1659680	Where have we been and what's to become of us?
1659680	1663680	Very eye-opening and then eye-punching and then eye-closing
1663680	1666680	because it'll just make you want to roll over
1666680	1670680	and wait for the dream slash nightmare of our evolution
1670680	1674680	to end the way it's going to, which is us becoming robot people.
1674680	1676680	Top two screws in the eyeball.
1676680	1678680	Yeah, I'm sure that's accurate.
1679680	1682680	Which of the screws into the eyeballs
1682680	1685680	did you find most memorable or interesting?
1685680	1687680	Yeah, Dan.
1687680	1690680	Yeah, which screws into the eyeballs?
1690680	1693680	You got to say things. It's a podcast.
1695680	1699680	People are paying money for the words.
1700680	1703680	I thought the most interesting aspect was tracing the evolution
1703680	1709680	of human religion globally from animism or animus,
1709680	1712680	whatever that is, where we were talking about that last time,
1712680	1714680	like, oh, my friend's a bird.
1714680	1718680	He brought me fire and he can fly and I can't
1718680	1722680	and kind of on equal terms with everything around me.
1722680	1726680	Also, my worst enemy, my best friend, all these critters.
1726680	1730680	And moving from that to polytheism, moving from that to monotheism.
1730680	1733680	And then we really have replaced that with humanism.
1733680	1736680	Even if we don't want to admit it and we want to talk about things
1736680	1738680	like I believe in God and all that stuff,
1738680	1741680	we still are having conversations about looking within ourselves,
1741680	1743680	which wasn't always the case a long time ago.
1743680	1748680	You would actually grab a sword and run over to the Middle East with it
1748680	1752680	because you truly actually believed that something outside yourself
1752680	1755680	was going to make you a silver surfer after you died.
1755680	1759680	Like, you really believed in it in the way that you believe
1759680	1761680	where Waze is telling you to go.
1761680	1762680	Like, it was a concrete thought.
1762680	1764680	You can still have that philosophy these days.
1764680	1766680	Was that how the Crusades was?
1766680	1767680	Yeah.
1767680	1771680	Like, people back then really believed that there was like an external force
1771680	1774680	and we have evolved in terms of our philosophy,
1774680	1776680	even the religious among us.
1776680	1779680	Even a zealot is somebody who's still saying, you know,
1779680	1782680	I've looked within myself and I know what God's mission is.
1782680	1785680	Kind of like they're not waiting for like a cloud to like come
1785680	1787680	and help save them from pigeons or something.
1787680	1792680	Like, we've all evolved into humanism, the worship of humanity.
1792680	1795680	And then taking that and saying like, well,
1795680	1801680	there's two big branches of humanism that are kind of, you know, at odds.
1801680	1805680	And like the one that's won out is liberal humanism,
1805680	1808680	which is basically saying, look, I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow,
1808680	1811680	but I know it's important to be human.
1811680	1814680	You know, and then the other one is the evolutionary humanism.
1814680	1816680	And a lot of us probably go back and forth between these things,
1816680	1818680	but in our current political state,
1818680	1822680	you can see these things magnified to the point where they could kill ants
1822680	1826680	and burn wood because it's like the extreme forms of that shit
1826680	1829680	in the way that you pull a lever in a pulling booth is like,
1829680	1831680	it's like, God damn it.
1831680	1833680	The fucking, like the evolutionary humanism is like,
1833680	1839680	I love humanity so much that I don't want that person slowing us down.
1839680	1841680	I don't want that person getting away with anything.
1841680	1845680	I'm tired of saying that that person's equal to that person.
1845680	1848680	When we all know that's not true, some things are more valuable than others.
1848680	1852680	Like, let's stop fucking around and let's get better.
1852680	1856680	I say that with a mocking voice because that's not the team I fight for
1856680	1859680	because I don't, how do you stand on that slope
1859680	1862680	without slipping into the fucking moftarkin territory?
1862680	1864680	Like, I don't know.
1864680	1868680	Maybe it says more about me than you that I can't go near that fucking slope.
1868680	1870680	I choose not to. I don't want to stand there.
1870680	1873680	I prefer the liberal humanism which is like,
1873680	1876680	but the interesting thing is that he earns his trajectory
1876680	1881680	by explaining where we've been and talking about how like World War II
1881680	1886680	is like this kind of like grand sort of climax of the,
1886680	1892680	it was a battle during which like liberal democracy,
1892680	1897680	it was this close to extinction because it was catching a left punch from socialism.
1897680	1901680	All the poor people waking up, you can see this in your friends.
1901680	1905680	We're having these conversations right now with the socialists saying,
1905680	1910680	hey, liberals, you know, like you are rich and you are privileged
1910680	1913680	and you are saying that you want everybody to be free
1913680	1916680	because if they're free, they're free to do what they did yesterday
1916680	1920680	and do the same thing tomorrow and you're free to be rich and they're free to be poor.
1920680	1923680	And socialists are like, we're catching on to you.
1923680	1927680	You're not, you're an elitist and get that left punch coming.
1927680	1931680	And then at the same time leading up to World War II,
1931680	1935680	there's this right punch coming from your little characters around the world
1935680	1937680	who are going, hey, I'm poor too.
1937680	1940680	And you know what? I'm sick and tired of saying that guy's beautiful
1940680	1942680	when the truth is he's ugly.
1942680	1946680	And I don't want to listen to this song when I want to listen to Wagner.
1946680	1949680	It's beautiful. It's the best music ever.
1949680	1953680	I'm tired of fucking around and I'm going to troll the world
1953680	1957680	and prove that everything needs to be better
1957680	1959680	and I stop lying. Everyone tell the truth.
1959680	1964680	Life is ugly and we can make it more beautiful if we fucking eat each other.
1964680	1968680	And both of those guys, you get a left fist and a right fist
1968680	1973680	coming at the people with all the money who were like living high in the hog
1973680	1977680	and who could only win that war, that chapter,
1977680	1980680	really by forming an alliance with socialism.
1980680	1984680	We could only really win World War II by teaming up with Russia.
1984680	1989680	But that's just a microcosm of the general facts
1989680	1992680	that as far as these data fields are concerned, these philosophies,
1992680	1994680	it's like liberal democracy.
1994680	1997680	It's sort of like saying, hey, can't we all just get along?
1997680	1999680	Can't we all just hang out?
1999680	2002680	Your crimes are unintentional kind of when you say that.
2002680	2004680	Your crimes are silence.
2004680	2008680	Your crimes are you're not really helping necessarily.
2008680	2011680	And that needed to be fused with, hey, it's great.
2011680	2014680	You'd be poor. Other people could be rich.
2014680	2018680	We had to pair that with, I believe in that so much, I'd like to help the poor.
2018680	2021680	Like that kind of fusion came out of that chapter,
2021680	2026680	which is the only way that this liberalistic humanism
2026680	2030680	beat out the evolutionary humanistic model.
2030680	2034680	But the punchline is that it matters to us a lot,
2034680	2036680	but it doesn't really matter on the grand scale.
2036680	2040680	You can tell this guy is like, those are just roads that sort of go like this
2040680	2043680	and I'm waving my hands in a nonsensical motion for those.
2043680	2046680	He's like doing a double helix situation.
2046680	2051680	It's like I consider it a great thing that one side won out over the other,
2051680	2056680	but kind of all roads lead to a distinct lack of Rome in that,
2057680	2061680	it's like all humanism, which is the only thing that survived.
2061680	2067680	No one's out there like, I worship a black cat from outer space that really exists.
2067680	2070680	We are all humanists around the globe.
2070680	2075680	So these warring factions of humanists are all going to one way or another
2075680	2078680	be slaves to data, technology.
2078680	2084680	We're not going to be able to say that our goal is for humanity to be either happy
2085680	2088680	or evolved and improved.
2088680	2095680	Both of those teams would eventually just get swallowed up by algorithmic thinking
2095680	2100680	because even if you're the most loving, like let's just play it as it lays,
2100680	2104680	open your heart, be a good person kind of person,
2104680	2107680	it's only going to be a matter of time before that person has to admit
2107680	2113680	that doing that without using data that we are uncovering about people
2113680	2119680	is actually just willful disobedience of making people happy.
2119680	2124680	We're quickly approaching a threshold according to this author
2124680	2127680	where computers are going to, not computers,
2127680	2130680	I still think of computers as like a laptop and all this shit, whatever.
2130680	2133680	The fucking information field that we're creating,
2133680	2138680	the internet of all things, is going to know us better than we know ourselves.
2138680	2145680	We're not going to be able to keep up with people who are willing to let data tell them
2145680	2151680	who to date tomorrow, what to eat, where to put their kids in school,
2151680	2153680	how to approach their philosophy.
2153680	2157680	No matter what your philosophy is, algorithms are going to be,
2157680	2160680	it's like the way I put it, I'm not paraphrasing him,
2160680	2165680	you can't shake your fist at a choo-choo train faster than a train.
2165680	2167680	You can stand next to a train track and go,
2167680	2170680	I hate that darn train track, and you could be right.
2170680	2173680	Train tracks are ugly, the thing blows smoke,
2173680	2177680	it's beautiful next to the train track, you could live in a nice log cabin,
2177680	2182680	but everybody on the train is going to fuck more and make more people
2182680	2185680	than the person in the log cabin, so that's just the basic.
2185680	2189680	Where does that put your philosophy right now? Where are you at?
2189680	2193680	I think it puts all of our philosophies in this kind of just sort of newly
2193680	2197680	perspective, it's like, oh, so that's the struggle we're having right now,
2197680	2200680	but then it's like, oh, does it really matter almost?
2200680	2204680	Because it's like, we're so close to an age,
2204680	2208680	and he wrote this book in 2016, January I think,
2208680	2213680	and so I would think that he would have more paragraphs about told you so,
2213680	2218680	if while he was writing it he was working this shit happening,
2218680	2221680	because he's kind of predicting it in this book, and I'm like, oh, shit.
2221680	2222680	What is he predicting?
2222680	2230680	Well, just the idea that democracy is going to start to be assailed by data,
2230680	2235680	that algorithms, and he gives this example, and I think it's just blind,
2235680	2240680	he didn't read about Cambridge Analytica, he's just giving the example,
2240680	2245680	he goes, Facebook accounts have more information about people
2245680	2250680	than they have about themselves, and they did a study where people said,
2250680	2255680	they gave people's closest friends a test about their friends.
2255680	2257680	They said, how well do you know Jeff Davis?
2257680	2260680	Answer these questions, and then they kept the algorithmically
2260680	2263680	predicted answers to themselves, and theirs were more accurate,
2263680	2268680	that Facebook itself can answer questions about you more than your friends can,
2268680	2272680	and then on top of it, more than you can, because we don't remember shit,
2272680	2275680	like we live a fucking weird experiential life,
2275680	2281680	but our narrative is like, it's hardwired, so the guy gives this example,
2281680	2284680	it's a little hokey, but it's also just kind of poetic,
2284680	2287680	of like, you're going to go on a date in the future,
2287680	2292680	and you say to your Cortana Google thing, you go, I don't know who I should,
2292680	2297680	I got Carl called me, and Jerry called me, like, Jerry's awesome,
2297680	2301680	and he makes me laugh, but Carl has more respect for me, I think,
2301680	2306680	I don't know, I'm so confused, my parents, I don't know what to do,
2306680	2313680	and we'll quickly be approaching a time when this Google Cortana Siri thing,
2313680	2316680	whatever this is, will say to you, hey, listen,
2316680	2319680	I know you better than you know yourself.
2319680	2322680	I'm not talking down to you, I'm just here to help,
2322680	2327680	and I know you so well that I know you're not going to like what I have to tell you,
2327680	2330680	but I have monitored your heart rate on every date you've ever been on
2330680	2333680	with both of these guys, and I have monitored their heart rates,
2333680	2337680	and I'd rather I've talked to their Cortana Google series,
2337680	2343680	because you guys gave limited authorization to do a little brokering
2343680	2348680	of the adrenaline, of the endocrine levels and the things that you felt,
2348680	2352680	and I've read all of the books that you've read,
2352680	2356680	I've even finished the books that you fell asleep reading,
2356680	2359680	and I've noted the parts where you fall asleep,
2359680	2363680	I've noted the paragraphs that you have to read over and over again,
2363680	2366680	because some of them you want, they're important to you,
2366680	2369680	some of them you're too dense to get,
2369680	2373680	and all of this for me is information, and for you it's just fleeting gas,
2373680	2377680	and if you get a cold you might vote wrong,
2377680	2381680	whereas I know what you march for, and I know what t-shirts you buy,
2381680	2386680	and I know how you genuinely feel on average for the last 15 years of your life,
2386680	2390680	and I'm telling you 87% Carl, that's all I'm going to say,
2390680	2394680	and also wear the green dress, it makes you look better,
2394680	2398680	like you've been retaining water lately and you tend to blah blah blah,
2398680	2403680	it's going to be better at telling you shit that's going to actually make you succeed
2403680	2407680	by our definitions of success better than your aunt can.
2407680	2409680	What's bad about that though?
2409680	2412680	There's nothing bad, it's like this guy is continually pummeling,
2412680	2417680	it's meat tenderizing, it just bashes humanity into this,
2417680	2421680	he's like, just admit it, we're going to merge with data.
2421680	2424680	Especially, you're into this kind of stuff,
2424680	2427680	does that scare you or do you dig that?
2427680	2430680	No, because I think the bad aspects of that,
2430680	2433680	like society using evil data to control people's minds,
2433680	2437680	that's already happening, so it's going to get worse the same way
2437680	2441680	everything's always getting worse, but I think the potential for good is good,
2441680	2444680	I don't know, there's one government, I don't know where it is,
2444680	2446680	it's in like the Netherlands or something, I don't know,
2446680	2453680	but they have a section of government where they enact legislation by science,
2453680	2457680	so they use data to determine what's probably the best policy to enact,
2457680	2460680	then they do a test run of that policy, take data,
2460680	2463680	and then they analyze that policy and do another test policy
2463680	2467680	until they have policy that they can actually enact that they know is going to work,
2467680	2470680	and it doesn't have to do with voting, it's just data and knowledge and science,
2470680	2472680	and that's probably better than governance,
2472680	2475680	I can see how that can be hijacked by manipulators,
2475680	2478680	but on its own, every system is like that.
2478680	2481680	But if it flows freely enough, hacking it shouldn't matter too much,
2481680	2484680	especially things that don't have to do with privacy.
2484680	2486680	Do we all have to fuck Carl?
2486680	2490680	Yeah, we'll have to wear a green dress and body shame ourselves.
2490680	2494680	I'm more concerned about this green dress.
2495680	2499680	Yeah, it makes a pretty compelling argument for like,
2499680	2502680	you know, right now we're worried about voting fraud
2502680	2505680	and like how do we keep the polls honest,
2505680	2506680	and hopefully we'll get through that,
2506680	2509680	but there is going to come a point where we're going to start,
2509680	2512680	if we're going to evolve, we're going to be asking ourselves at a certain point,
2512680	2519680	why are we going to the poll to do this when the poll is supposed to be a measurement
2519680	2523680	of all of these like processors that are supposed to be networked together
2523680	2526680	that are living their life together and having a social contract together,
2526680	2530680	so why go every two years and four years for these referendums
2530680	2537680	that are purposely boiling things down to an obfuscated kind of set of data
2537680	2541680	as opposed to just, you know, like if the algorithms get good enough
2541680	2545680	at regulating society and making things fair for people,
2545680	2550680	if that's its directive, hey, Skynet, make things fair, okay, we'll do.
2551680	2554680	We'll go through phases where we're like, Skynet, I'm watching you,
2554680	2556680	don't go Terminator on us.
2556680	2559680	Haha, I saw that movie too, I understand the reverence.
2561680	2563680	But seriously, I'll get you to work on time,
2563680	2568680	and we'll kind of like let Waze get us to work on time a few times
2568680	2571680	before we're willing to say, all right, just pick the route, just pick the route.
2571680	2575680	And then after a while, if everyone says just pick the route,
2575680	2579680	we're not going to get any more upset about it picking everyone's route
2579680	2584680	and collectively ushering us into ways that get everyone home
2584680	2589680	any more than we get upset about, hey, who chose the shape of this aluminum can?
2589680	2593680	I think big vending machines behind this soda, you know,
2593680	2596680	like we don't really, we're not like, how do you know,
2596680	2600680	how I'm boxed out of whether or not this is a perfect cylinder,
2600680	2603680	like we just kind of trust a bunch of shit after a while.
2603680	2607680	We're just like, okay, I guess that's how soda should be shaped, I don't know.
2607680	2608680	I grew up on it.
2608680	2612680	And yeah, any hacking, any kind of hacking stories will just be like,
2612680	2614680	see, that's why you need more security.
2614680	2619680	Like North Koreans gave you a flu, like in your nano virus protection,
2619680	2623680	like your kid got a cold because of North Korea, guess we need to upgrade.
2623680	2627680	Like, and anybody that's a ludite is just going to get sick and die sooner.
2627680	2628680	Oh well.
2629680	2631680	Look, I'm out.
2632680	2636680	I always finish these books, I get a pit in my stomach and then I'm like,
2636680	2639680	just get to the part where you say this won't happen for 50 years.
2639680	2640680	And that's what he does at the end.
2640680	2642680	He's like, of course, this could take 50 years or 100.
2642680	2643680	I'm like, peace.
2645680	2650680	I just want people to find my one-eyed willy skeleton with a Minecraft laptop,
2650680	2653680	like fucking, is this a boob?
2653680	2654680	What did he want?
2654680	2658680	He tried to close the laptop and a fucking bowling ball falls on you.
2658680	2659680	For no reason.
2659680	2660680	I mean, there's no treasure.
2660680	2662680	What the fuck were those pirates doing?
2663680	2665680	What the, what the fuck was it?
2665680	2667680	What were they doing?
2667680	2671680	Like, let's go into this cave.
2671680	2672680	Okay.
2672680	2673680	All right.
2673680	2674680	But just for a little bit, right?
2674680	2675680	A little bit.
2675680	2677680	I don't raining and I'm getting me patched.
2677680	2678680	Okay.
2678680	2683680	And I understand the Spanish are chasing us to Seattle and I just,
2683680	2689680	I just want to make sure you have a tendency to over develop things.
2689680	2694680	And I want to make sure as an pirate who has been honored to work with you,
2694680	2699680	that you don't go into a tailspin of a, okay.
2699680	2701680	We could have been in there three times by now.
2701680	2702680	Okay.
2702680	2703680	All right.
2703680	2704680	You don't have to high road me.
2704680	2707680	Oh, let's, let's start speaking Spanish.
2707680	2709680	Let's get into the cave.
2709680	2711680	Let's hide in the cave because it's raining.
2711680	2712680	Okay.
2712680	2713680	It's raining in the Spanish.
2713680	2714680	Okay.
2714680	2715680	Let's make sure, you know what?
2715680	2716680	Let's seal this.
2716680	2717680	Let's seal it up behind us.
2717680	2719680	I'll seal it up with cement.
2719680	2720680	Okay.
2720680	2721680	You know what?
2721680	2724680	Uh, make sure the cement, uh.
2724680	2725680	Is wet.
2725680	2731480	Well, that it, you know, just make sure there's like a kind of omega protocol where if the
2731480	2737920	ship needs to go back out, that there's something that can trigger the ship leaving your ceiling.
2737920	2739680	Don't seal us in.
2739680	2740680	Yeah.
2740680	2741680	Well.
2741680	2742680	Yeah.
2742680	2743680	Yeah.
2743680	2744680	Okay.
2744680	2745680	Yeah.
2746680	2747680	Shit.
2747680	2748680	Oh, fuck.
2748680	2749680	God damn it.
2749680	2750680	The Spanish found us.
2750680	2753680	I knew we shouldn't have gone to Seattle.
2753680	2755680	No, not me important either.
2755680	2756680	Well, look.
2756680	2757680	Hey.
2757680	2758680	All right.
2758680	2759680	You're either going to need to be joined.
2759680	2761680	Join One-Eyed Willie and the Pirates.
2761680	2764680	I promise you, riches beyond your wildest imaginings.
2764680	2766680	What's in it for me?
2766680	2767680	Hmm?
2767680	2768680	What's in it for me?
2768680	2769680	Uh, well.
2769680	2771680	Also, I speak English because, you know, the English.
2771680	2773680	Treasure is in it for you.
2773680	2774680	Okay.
2774680	2778680	The rest is a bit of help setting a few moderate booby traps.
2778680	2779680	Okay.
2779680	2780680	That is my especial.
2780680	2783160	Because we can't have this repeated.
2783160	2785040	Does anyone else know you can't.
2785040	2786040	We can't have more of you.
2786040	2788680	I'm just a lonely Spanish pirate.
2788680	2789680	All right.
2789680	2790680	All right.
2790680	2791680	All right.
2791680	2792680	Let's talk.
2792680	2793680	More work.
2793680	2794680	Does anyone know piano?
2794680	2795680	Yeah.
2795680	2797680	I have an idea for a booby trap.
2797680	2800680	I'm not the best with instruments.
2800680	2801680	Si.
2801680	2802680	Si.
2802680	2803680	You've taken piano?
2803680	2804680	Okay.
2804680	2810680	I'm going to get ten of our guys to dig a bottomless pit.
2810680	2811680	Right.
2811680	2812680	Or find one.
2812680	2813680	Fuck it.
2813680	2814680	You know?
2814680	2815680	Maybe we'll get lucky.
2815680	2816680	Oh.
2816680	2817680	I would pit.
2817680	2819680	You found a pit.
2819680	2821680	No, no.
2821680	2824680	This place is built next to a giant pit.
2824680	2825680	Great.
2825680	2828680	Well, let's build one of these concrete seals.
2828680	2830680	Am I still with the wall?
2830680	2831680	Yes.
2831680	2832680	You keep up with the wall.
2832680	2833680	Oh.
2833680	2834680	All right.
2834680	2835680	Okay.
2835680	2836680	I didn't stop.
2836680	2837680	Actually, you know what?
2837680	2838680	What?
2838680	2839680	Can I just one memo before we start all these booby trap projects?
2839680	2840680	Yes.
2840680	2841680	Can we make sure that...
2841680	2842680	The men's drying.
2842680	2847280	Can we make sure every day, every day, no matter how much booby track work we have to
2847280	2855560	do, we all meet back here in the galley of the ship and sit down in case we all die at
2855560	2858280	the same time.
2858280	2861560	That seems like very, very sound advice.
2861560	2867120	It's just, you know, I know it's a rare chance, but if it happens, boy, can you imagine finding
2867120	2868120	this ship?
2868120	2869120	But why?
2869120	2870120	And it's like, whoa.
2870120	2871600	They all died around the table.
2871600	2872600	All right.
2872600	2875320	I'm going to go find the piano and put it next to the pit.
2875320	2876320	What am I doing?
2876320	2877320	I forget.
2877320	2878320	You...
2878320	2887760	You give me a music, sheet music for scales and tell Tony to stop driving like a maniac
2887760	2893900	or I swear I'm going to stab him in both eyes until to the point where bone grows over
2893900	2896920	his eye sockets, wedging the knives in.
2896920	2898480	I feel like you need to calm down.
2898480	2899480	I think...
2899480	2900480	The men's drying.
2900480	2901480	You're right.
2901480	2902480	You're right.
2902480	2903480	Still drying.
2903480	2904480	Sorry.
2904480	2906880	Has anyone put the giant octopus in the water?
2906880	2907880	No, no, no.
2907880	2909680	We're not going to use that.
2909680	2910680	We decided...
2910680	2911680	We took a couple of pictures.
2911680	2912680	It didn't work out.
2912680	2913680	We'll fix it in post.
2913680	2914680	Yeah.
2914680	2915680	It was a good idea.
2916680	2918560	It was a good idea there.
2918560	2924080	It was a good idea there, but it just didn't come together the way...
2924080	2925440	And the cement is dry.
2925440	2926440	It's dry.
2926440	2927440	I'm going to put...
2927440	2930800	I was waiting for you to finish talking to the Omega door.
2930800	2934680	Hey, Señora, Señora, I have the piano right next to the bottom of this piece.
2934680	2935680	Oh, shit.
2935680	2936680	Okay.
2936680	2937680	He dropped his piece.
2937680	2940200	You know, I predict that that's going to keep happening.
2940200	2941240	We know what we need to do.
2941240	2947440	We need to make a safety waterslide that leads right to the ship for anyone who runs
2947440	2951320	into too much trouble, so they can just skirt around all of the tracks.
2951320	2955760	No matter whether they fail or succeed, they should just be able to ultimately just slide
2955760	2959040	down a waterslide and get right to the treasure.
2959040	2960040	Hey, already done.
2960040	2961040	Already done.
2961040	2962040	Oh, great.
2962040	2963040	Great.
2963040	2964040	All right.
2964040	2965040	Hello.
2965040	2966040	That's a fucking ghost.
2966040	2967040	Oh, God.
2967040	2968040	He's a ghost.
2968040	2969040	The fucking ghost.
2969040	2970040	Oh, shit.
2970040	2971040	I'm the god Poseidon.
2971040	2972040	Oh.
2972040	2974560	Oh, it's a fucking god.
2974560	2976280	Who put this guy in charge?
2976280	2979280	This guy doesn't know what the fuck I had to do.
2979280	2980280	Shit.
2980280	2983880	I'm just a god Poseidon, but this guy seems like he doesn't...
2983880	2984880	He's all over the shop.
2984880	2985880	You're Aquaman in the house.
2985880	2986880	What the fuck is going on over here?
2986880	2987880	Oh, shit.
2987880	2988880	Aquaman.
2988880	2989880	Oh, shit.
2989880	2990880	Hey, Aquaman.
2990880	2991880	Look at this guy over here.
2991880	2992880	He's making rules and fucking...
2992880	2993880	What the...
2993880	2994880	Crossover is going...
2994880	2995880	What?
2995880	2996880	It's Aquaman.
2996880	2997880	What the hell?
2998720	2999720	I mean, I...
2999720	3000720	Yeah.
3000720	3001720	Anyways.
3001720	3002720	It just seems like...
3002720	3003720	Quit playing with the piano.
3003720	3006080	It seems like those pirates spent a...
3006080	3008240	So, okay.
3008240	3009720	That was the Goonies?
3009720	3010720	Yeah.
3010720	3011920	Okay.
3011920	3013760	That was the Goonies.
3013760	3015600	Yeah.
3015600	3017720	I was in a commercial for the Goonies.
3017720	3018720	Oh, really?
3018720	3019720	Yeah.
3019720	3020720	What do you mean?
3020720	3021720	That's the end of that story.
3021720	3024280	Like you were saying, like, I just saw it and it's great.
3024280	3025280	No.
3025680	3031080	My dad worked for a TV station and, like, back then, like, local channels did a lot more
3031080	3035400	like work than they currently do relative to, like, the top-down advertising stuff.
3035400	3040720	So he cut the local ad for, like, the TV showing of the Goonies.
3040720	3045880	And his genius idea was, like, having his kids get sucked into the televisions to get
3045880	3049840	set where they're going through all these Goonies scenes that they're green-screened
3049840	3050840	into.
3050840	3051840	What the fuck?
3051840	3052840	What the fuck?
3052840	3053840	What?
3053840	3055280	How long have I known you?
3055280	3057640	Why are you first telling us this now?
3057640	3058640	Did you...
3058640	3059640	Where is this?
3059640	3060640	It took me that whole sketch...
3060640	3061680	Why are we watching it?
3061680	3065520	It took me that whole sketch to realize you were doing the Goonies.
3065520	3066520	Where?
3066520	3068640	I did not know that this was what you cared about.
3068640	3069640	I understand that.
3069640	3074480	That was a long, long pier for you to walk off of, you know, what we were talking about,
3074480	3075480	the Goonies.
3075480	3076480	But we've known you for...
3076480	3078480	Since the fucking documentary about this guy...
3078480	3080440	I didn't know that's something that matters to people.
3080440	3086400	You ever told us that you got zapped into a television green-screened in front of shit?
3086400	3087400	Where is it?
3087400	3088400	I don't know.
3088400	3089400	Where is it?
3089400	3090400	I bet we can find it.
3090400	3091400	I want to watch it now.
3091400	3092400	Yeah.
3092400	3093400	It doesn't...
3093400	3094400	Like, yeah.
3094400	3095400	Where?
3095400	3096400	So...
3096400	3097400	Where?
3097400	3098400	I don't know.
3098400	3099400	Well, someone...
3099400	3100400	Can you guys look for it while we're doing this?
3100400	3101400	I don't know what to search for.
3101400	3102400	Can you call somebody?
3102400	3103400	Don't pay attention to the comedy.
3103400	3104400	Call somebody.
3104400	3105400	Um...
3105400	3107160	I could text my dad.
3107160	3108160	Let's see what he says.
3108160	3109160	Text your dad?
3109160	3110160	Yeah.
3110160	3111160	I have this idea.
3111160	3114480	Are you fucking kidding me?
3114480	3115480	Did you have the beard back?
3115480	3116480	I still...
3116480	3118600	Yeah, I had the beard.
3118600	3121840	Just to warn you, if you try to text your dad, there's no signal up here, and a lot
3121840	3125800	of people will think you texted your dad two weeks in a row, and they'll be really disappointed
3125800	3129000	to hear that the messages didn't actually go out.
3129000	3131000	Oh.
3131000	3135760	I can't believe this shit I'm hearing!
3135760	3136760	I can't believe it!
3136760	3137760	Why can't you?
3137760	3138760	Why are you...
3138960	3139960	I don't understand...
3139960	3140960	You're so fucking cool!
3140960	3141960	Why?
3141960	3142960	What?
3142960	3144960	What are you talking about?
3144960	3145960	You don't know why?
3145960	3151240	No, because I was a kid sitting on a couch, and my dad took maybe 12 seconds of footage,
3151240	3153200	and then he cut an ad out of it.
3153200	3154400	I wasn't on a...
3154400	3155920	I was at home.
3155920	3157280	What's cool about it?
3157280	3159000	You have to explain what's cool about it.
3159000	3161760	Well, don't you ever laugh at Tim and Eric stuff?
3161760	3163720	Well, sure.
3163720	3168440	Well, so it probably looks kind of funny that you're getting green screens zapped into
3168440	3173720	the Goonies, and also it's you, and you probably don't have a beard, and there's probably
3173720	3175560	a lot of funny elements about it.
3175560	3177560	Yeah, the same way there's a lot of...
3177560	3180760	It's like finding out that after doing Jack Black for a thousand years, that he was the
3180760	3182560	guy in the Pitfall commercial.
3182560	3187560	But that's good, because Pitfall was an enduring game and commercial.
3187560	3189560	Goonies isn't well-remembered.
3189560	3191560	Yeah, no, not at all.
3191560	3192560	I get it.
3192560	3193560	No.
3193560	3194560	I can see the comparison.
3194560	3195560	No one cares about the Goonies.
3195560	3196560	Nobody cares about...
3196680	3199680	Nobody cares about you, the old man.
3199680	3201680	I want to see this commercial.
3201680	3202680	See, that's what I wasn't getting.
3202680	3207560	I got high with Dick Donner, the director of the Goonies, but I didn't know that it was...
3207560	3208560	Richard Donner.
3208560	3209560	Yeah.
3209560	3212280	It's Dick to Jeff, because he got high with them.
3212280	3217440	I didn't know it was Richard Donner who created Superman, or directed Superman.
3217440	3220440	The creator of Superman, Richard Donner.
3220440	3223440	I remember when I created Superman.
3223440	3224440	He directed...
3225320	3228320	I remember the first drawing of Superman when I was...
3228320	3229320	He directed Superman.
3229320	3238320	I was Richard Donner, and I drew, wrote, and created Superman before making the movie.
3238320	3239320	Superman.
3239320	3240320	Don't be mad at me.
3240320	3241320	And the Goonies.
3241320	3242320	I'm on your side.
3242320	3243320	I was a comic book artist.
3243320	3245320	I'm Richard Donner.
3245320	3249040	Dick Donner, too, by Google's friends.
3249040	3251840	How many of you guys, honestly...
3251840	3254080	By applause, and, you know, I'm...
3254080	3256080	That was a good Richard Donner.
3256080	3262720	I'm predicting 8%, some of you guys who are on the cusp that are gonna fake this to make
3262720	3265240	yourselves feel younger.
3265240	3272520	So that's margin of error, 8%, but applaud if you didn't get the Goonies references.
3272520	3273520	Okay.
3273520	3278480	That's a margin of 8%, that's like, yeah, so like four people.
3278720	3279720	Okay.
3279720	3280720	I'm still half...
3280720	3283720	Applaud if you didn't enjoy yourself anyway.
3283720	3285000	I'm actually kind of sick.
3285000	3287080	I've never thought that that movie...
3287080	3288080	Reddit is going...
3288080	3298080	Shrobs clapping, exaggeratedly.
3298080	3302640	Make my face, my hand's bigger.
3302640	3303640	I didn't get...
3303640	3308600	Oftentimes, I don't hear the first half of what Rob says, so I just catch him on the
3308600	3311360	tail and I'm like, what is happening?
3311360	3312360	That's all that matters.
3312360	3313920	That's all that matters.
3313920	3315040	But I am...
3315040	3317120	I would have been fine, by the way, if it was the whole audience.
3317120	3321040	I would have been a little regretful of making you listen to 10 minutes of radio play about
3321040	3322040	Goonies, but...
3322040	3327160	Why are these chairs taped off for you, sir?
3327160	3329360	Can you read off those names on that tape?
3329360	3330360	Breitbart?
3330360	3331360	Like the Supremacy.
3331360	3332360	Okay.
3332360	3333360	These are fuckers that I invited.
3333360	3334360	I'm back here.
3334360	3335360	Where?
3335360	3336360	You there?
3336360	3337360	Born in Hickenbotham?
3337360	3338360	I'm back here.
3338360	3339360	So in the future...
3339360	3340360	I thought you were...
3340360	3341360	You have seats up front, motherfucker.
3341360	3342360	You're fucking bumping...
3342360	3343360	Yeah.
3343360	3344360	Walk it down here and get your...
3344360	3356000	In the future, we'll have Jeff tell you that we're roping off seats for you.
3356000	3357000	That way, you'll know.
3357000	3358000	This guy's name is Hickenbotham?
3358440	3359440	Hickenbotham?
3359440	3360440	I was late.
3360440	3361440	I didn't want to interrupt.
3361440	3362440	All right.
3362440	3363440	Get down there.
3363440	3368520	Thank God you didn't do that.
3368520	3371040	That's not his fault.
3371040	3372040	That's not his fault.
3372040	3375880	Somebody's name Born, like Jason Born with an E, and someone's name is Hickenbotham, which
3375880	3377080	sounds like a made up name.
3377080	3378080	It is a weird...
3378080	3380080	Like, you picture Jason Born when you picture...
3380080	3381080	Here's Hickenbotham.
3381080	3382080	Here's Hickenbotham.
3382080	3383080	You picture, like, a jug band.
3383080	3386080	Welcome, Hickenbotham and Born, everybody.
3387080	3392080	Here's Hickenbotham and Born's Hee Haw Act from years ago.
3392080	3394080	Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter.
3394080	3395080	Hey, Jason!
3395080	3396080	Is it true that...
3396080	3397080	You want to start?
3397080	3398080	You want to start?
3398080	3399080	It was cool.
3399080	3414080	I wanted to come out from the cornstalk, but he's in place.
3414080	3415080	You want to start with the top?
3415080	3416080	The guy looks...
3416080	3417080	Oh!
3417080	3418080	Until the music goes away.
3418080	3419080	What happened?
3419080	3424080	It looks like another Hickenbotham and Born sketch.
3424080	3425080	Okay.
3425080	3426080	All right.
3426080	3427080	Well, it's not going to hold up.
3427080	3428080	That's...
3428080	3429080	Okay.
3429080	3430080	Hey.
3430080	3431080	Hey.
3431080	3432080	Hey, Born.
3432080	3433080	Yeah, Hickenbotham.
3433080	3443680	Is it true when you sit in any room, you always are aware of where the exits are and how to
3443680	3445680	field strip any weapon?
3445680	3450680	Yeah, but I still can't get my ex-wife to stop taking alimony.
3450680	3453680	Hee Haw!
3453680	3462600	Now, I know you saw the Goonies, but I also know I got away with that because you've never
3462600	3464880	seen Hee Haw.
3464880	3468320	I've barely seen Hee Haw, and I'm a test tube baby.
3468320	3469320	That's how old I am.
3470320	3473320	They strip up behind plywood corn and told jokes.
3473320	3474320	Yeah.
3474320	3475320	It's very good.
3475320	3476320	Hey, Doc.
3476320	3477320	Did you...
3477320	3480320	I heard an invisible man can't outshine your corn pone.
3480320	3483320	Say what?
3483320	3495320	They also would have a bit where they would have this old man with glasses and a mustache
3495320	3501320	sitting in a window, miming like he's wiping the window, but there was no glass, and then
3501320	3506320	you would hear off camera, hey, grandpa, what's for supper?
3506320	3514320	Well, we've got corn on the cob and rice and beans, and we also got some green beans, too.
3514320	3515320	Yum, yum.
3515320	3518320	And then they would go back, and then that was it.
3518320	3519320	That was it.
3519320	3520320	That was the bit.
3520320	3523320	They did it every single episode.
3523320	3528320	And I remember Roy Clark and what's his name, and they would sing that, she met another,
3528320	3533320	and she was gone, but the gimmick was they'd sing the same song every time, but then the
3533320	3539320	runner was that they would in each other's faces, and then they would like break and
3539320	3540320	laugh.
3540320	3541320	There was a lot of...
3541320	3544320	The 70s culture was all about people breaking and laughing at what they were doing, so like
3544320	3546320	the cannonball run was like...
3546320	3551320	Yeah, it was like the Hillbilly version of Laugh-In, where it was more progressive.
3551320	3553320	You could get away with a lot of just like...
3553320	3557320	My wife told me, honey, it's our 50th wedding anniversary tonight.
3557320	3559320	Let's run upstairs and have sex.
3559320	3561320	And I told her I cannot do both.
3567320	3570320	I might look hard to get, but I can be had.
3575320	3576320	These are he-high jokes.
3576320	3580320	Yeah, I think it's time to introduce the band, and the band would all get up and...
3580320	3581320	Hello, my name's James.
3581320	3583320	They'd all get up and shake hands.
3583320	3584320	You know what would be interesting?
3584320	3585320	It makes me...
3585320	3588320	Because I was thinking, oh, you're like a digital Henny Youngman, and I was thinking
3588320	3589320	it would be interesting to do...
3589320	3594320	No one's doing a full new wave Gary Newman version of Henny Youngman, like a guy that
3594320	3603320	just looks like a corpse, and he's got baggy eyes, and he just has goth hair, and he tells
3603320	3606320	these one-liners, and then does Gary Newman stings.
3607320	3612320	My wife came to me and told me that she doesn't want to see me anymore.
3612320	3615320	I said, I can't riff a one-liner.
3615320	3617320	I said, why don't you poke your eyes out?
3622320	3623320	Me and my cars.
3623320	3624320	Me and my car.
3625320	3627320	Friends are electric.
3627320	3630320	This is Zach Galifianakis, but the piano's electric.
3631320	3636320	I mean, look, I don't care if what I want to see is compatible with the planet anymore.
3636320	3639320	I'm very comfortable retiring from the Earth.
3640320	3644320	What's one thing that you're comfortable not seeing?
3645320	3649320	Well, I'm still getting used to the Twitter addiction.
3649320	3653320	I've been off of Twitter for a month now.
3656320	3658320	You've lost like 40 characters.
3661320	3671320	I still have a kind of residual sense of loss, like a phantom limb.
3672320	3680320	A decade is a long time to express yourself and connect to others in one specific medium.
3681320	3685320	Even my generation isn't used to such stability.
3686320	3690320	Things usually change faster than Twitter even did.
3691320	3698320	I still feel like, oh, the myth that the soldier who was like, my arm hurts,
3698320	3701320	and it's like your arm got blown off.
3702320	3704320	I'm like, ah, I should tweet this.
3704320	3707320	You still have this sort of electrical impulse.
3707320	3711320	That's a tweet, but you can't tweet it.
3712320	3715320	Because that subsides, it's very much because I quit smoking.
3715320	3723320	I smoked from 18 to 32, so kind of a comparable addiction level as far as what to get over.
3724320	3728320	If it is like smoking, then I guess maybe a month from now,
3728320	3732320	it'll parabolically get to the point where I'll be like, oh, did I used to tweet?
3733320	3737320	Because I forget that I was ever a smoker, but that first couple of months is like,
3737320	3739320	God damn it, what the fuck?
3739320	3744320	Your whole neurology is based around this minute-to-minute flowchart.
3744320	3747320	Just a whole section of your flowchart is taken out.
3749320	3753320	It's tough because we are none of us.
3754320	3758320	We are right to not admit that it's important to us.
3759320	3761320	Why would we want to say that?
3762320	3763320	We know that it's stupid.
3764320	3768320	And so that actually makes it harder, same as with cigarettes,
3768320	3771320	because cigarettes don't say, it's good for you.
3771320	3776320	They show a cowboy going like, I must fucking do what I fucking want.
3777320	3780320	The messaging of cigarettes is like, fuck society,
3780320	3783320	and fucking die before you can fucking kill me.
3787320	3789320	That's a great commercial for cigarettes.
3789320	3792320	Good luck killing me, motherfucker, can't shoot a corpse.
3794320	3796320	That really is kind of the messaging of it.
3796320	3798320	I'll be dead 40 seconds before you kill me.
3801320	3804320	Those kind of benign little things.
3805320	3809320	What I'm hoping will return is the blogging instinct or something.
3810320	3813320	I so miss my 27-year-old self.
3813320	3820320	I miss that kid that was so trustful of the internet
3820320	3826320	and so actually appropriately self-loathing,
3826320	3832320	just enough that all he wanted was to actually just splay himself,
3832320	3835320	scatter himself against the rocks of the internet,
3835320	3840320	and say, yeah, look at every fucking shitty little piece of me
3840320	3842320	and choke on it.
3842320	3844320	I like that guy.
3845320	3847320	I think that guy is punk rock and interesting.
3847320	3848320	Sounds cool.
3849320	3851320	But I don't know if at 45 you can...
3851320	3853320	I don't know if it's healthy to emulate that guy.
3853320	3856320	We all know that's what 45-year-old guys do.
3856320	3860320	They try to emulate 27-year-olds and then the result is a little messy.
3861320	3863320	It results in a sunroof, basically.
3865320	3867320	Sunroof with a big bald spot coming out of it.
3867320	3870320	What about doing a diaristic thing like David Sedaris does
3870320	3872320	where he writes little short stories?
3872320	3873320	Well, that's what I'm basically...
3873320	3879320	I'm hoping that maybe that that Twitter point of the neurology
3879320	3883320	that it represents a cauterized thing
3883320	3886320	that will force a new neurology pattern,
3886320	3891320	that behind that is an impulse to share and explore,
3891320	3893320	and that it will be forced after a while.
3893320	3894320	I don't want to force it.
3894320	3897320	That it will grow and it will go,
3897320	3899320	God damn, I just want to fucking write.
3900320	3902320	I'm waiting to...
3902320	3906320	My therapist said, you have to create a new personality
3906320	3910320	that isn't linked to your brand and your fame and all these things
3910320	3913320	because those things are not...
3913320	3917320	You're nostalgic for an age before you were famous.
3917320	3921320	And so that kid is shooting a slingshot at the moon
3921320	3923320	and that's freedom of expression.
3923320	3927320	That's when you're hot and you're interesting
3927320	3931320	and you're saying things that people want to listen to.
3931320	3938320	So if you have any hope and you want to share your thoughts online,
3938320	3941320	what I need to do is keep an actual diary,
3941320	3943320	like I did when I was 27,
3943320	3947320	but the difficult thing is I need to become a different person.
3947320	3953320	I need to just be some random person who has zero followers on Monday.
3953320	3955320	Bachman books.
3956320	3958320	Be a Richard Bachman.
3958320	3960320	Be a Bachman.
3960320	3963320	You need to be a Bachman, Dick Bachman.
3963320	3965320	Am I being a pain in the ass, Dan,
3965320	3970320	to suggest again that you knuckle down and write features,
3970320	3973320	the stuff that you want to get off your chest and don't...
3973320	3975320	Do the thing that's the scariest thing.
3975320	3978320	I have jobs and stuff that will be very fulfilling and all this stuff,
3978320	3981320	but I'm talking about the kind of driftwood part of...
3982320	3988320	The stuff that's still part joy and part what I am good at.
3992320	3995320	I'm obviously so focused on Rick and Morty right now
3995320	4004320	and don't want a drop of myself to risk not going into that barrel,
4004320	4010320	but the truth is that there's a bunch of me that's of no use to Rick and Morty
4010320	4019320	and I would like to think that I'm still capable of writing,
4019320	4021320	of going like,
4021320	4024320	this is the day I had, this is how I feel about the world,
4024320	4031320	this is what I want to say to anyone who finds this after I'm dead.
4031320	4033320	For me, as a friendly viewer,
4033320	4036320	I'm going to hear most of what's already on your mind because we hang out,
4036320	4039320	but I would like to have it in paper form.
4039320	4041320	I would like to have it as a book.
4041320	4043320	Me too. I want to go back to that. That's what I'm saying.
4043320	4045320	I remember when Twitter came out,
4045320	4048320	because I was Spencer's age when MySpace happened,
4048320	4051320	and I remember walking with my friend Steven Notley,
4051320	4053320	who's been on this podcast.
4053320	4059320	I remember him as literally the first person that said the word blog to me.
4059320	4063320	We were walking back from the Rustic Inn to my place in Las Feliz
4063320	4067320	and he was talking about technology and how excited he was,
4067320	4069320	and he said,
4069320	4071320	people are doing these blogs now,
4071320	4073320	and I'm like, what's a blog?
4073320	4076320	It's just this crazy thing, this cultural revolution
4076320	4080320	where people are keeping these online diaries and they're just sharing whatever.
4080320	4085320	There's a guy that is an artist for Disney
4085320	4087320	and he just says whatever the fuck he wants to say.
4087320	4091320	He works at Disney, but it's hard for us to understand that,
4091320	4094320	but back then it was kind of like a loophole.
4094320	4096320	The internet was sort of like, in your wildest dreams,
4096320	4098320	anyone's ever going to listen to this,
4098320	4101320	because it's still what Dan Rather thinks that's important.
4101320	4105320	We exited that age so blindingly fast
4105320	4108320	that we can't even remember that it was like,
4108320	4111320	we went to the internet to actually put messages in bottles
4111320	4115320	and we're like, wouldn't it be hilarious if anybody ever found this?
4115320	4120320	That culture was so interesting.
4120320	4122320	I don't know if we can ever get it back,
4122320	4126320	but I remember when Twitter started happening
4126320	4128320	how unmistakable it was.
4128320	4133320	It was as clear as the difference between cocaine,
4133320	4136320	which I have snorted numerous times,
4136320	4141320	to a great end and talked about improv for six hours with people,
4141320	4146320	the only other people on coke who would want to talk about improv for six hours.
4146320	4151320	Then I remember getting that key bump of crystal,
4151320	4154320	like in a bathroom where it was like this burn,
4154320	4159320	and it was like, what the fuck is wrong with your coke?
4159320	4162320	That friend going, that wasn't coke.
4162320	4165320	I was like, yeah, it was shiny.
4165320	4167320	It was like, that was crystal meth.
4167320	4169320	It was like, it was ground up.
4169320	4177320	It was like, why do I want to go home and violate my sofa?
4177320	4179320	I don't want to talk to anyone about improv,
4179320	4181320	but I want to build a rocket.
4181320	4183320	I don't know what I want.
4183320	4184320	It was just a different thing,
4184320	4186320	and it didn't really matter if it was better or worse.
4186320	4190320	It was just the fact that it kind of made the other thing obsolete.
4190320	4197320	I remember with Twitter, it was like, oh, microblogging.
4197320	4200320	I noticed, I was tweeting, and people were making fun of Twitter.
4200320	4204320	They were like, oh, because Twitter would say, what's going on?
4204320	4206320	Then you'd answer, go, I don't know.
4206320	4208320	Everyone was like, tweet, I don't know.
4208320	4209320	What the fuck is this?
4209320	4211320	What's this shit?
4211320	4214320	And then it was like, you just noticed.
4214320	4217320	I was like, oh, I'm not blogging anymore.
4217320	4220320	Why would I when there was this rush?
4220320	4224320	Like, who was I kidding about why I was blogging?
4224320	4229320	And yet the irony is the discipline was more admirable.
4229320	4233320	Also, the blogging thing was a way of microwriting
4233320	4235320	where you could have been putting down things on paper,
4235320	4239320	and they could have been novels or short stories or diaristic stuff.
4239320	4244320	The big catch, 22, is that this is where I want to let all of us off the hook.
4244320	4249320	We've got to accept that the fact is that we're motivated
4249320	4252320	by a lot more than craftsmanship.
4252320	4256320	It is really hard to tell somebody to keep a journal
4256320	4258320	and put it under their bed every night.
4258320	4260320	There's a couple people out here maybe that are like,
4260320	4262320	what do you mean? That's the easiest thing in the world.
4262320	4263320	I love doing it.
4263320	4265320	I'm not going to one the neurological lottery
4265320	4273320	because there is this insidious, weird lobe of your brain
4273320	4276320	that goes back to when you're a chimp, I think, that's just like,
4276320	4280320	yeah, but when you're a kid and there's no internet,
4280320	4284320	writing in a spiral notebook about how your day went,
4284320	4289320	I have five spiral notebooks filled with my dumbass 16-year-old thoughts
4289320	4294320	and there wasn't enough internet back then for me to be that narcissistic
4294320	4296320	in digital form.
4296320	4299320	If there was Twitter when I was that age,
4299320	4302320	I wouldn't have written these obnoxious essays there.
4302320	4304320	Is it about the immediacy of it?
4304320	4307320	I think it's just what we're seeking.
4307320	4311320	If you get a job writing a TV show or a film and you go,
4311320	4313320	okay, I have to work on this, I get notes,
4313320	4316320	it all goes, it takes months and months,
4316320	4320320	years and years for you and Rob to write a thing together
4320320	4322320	or you alone to write a thing.
4322320	4324320	Is it the immediacy?
4324320	4325320	Yeah, I think it's the ratio.
4325320	4327320	I think it is.
4327320	4329320	To take a little piece of what you just said,
4329320	4335320	if you get a job doing something, like Dorothy Parker said,
4335320	4337320	I hate writing, I love having written,
4337320	4344320	but also I can't give you a first draft,
4344320	4346320	but I love closing the deal, the right one.
4346320	4349320	That day that you run off of the Warner Brothers a lot
4349320	4351320	and you're like, they fucking bought it.
4351320	4352320	What the fuck?
4352320	4355320	Talking robots mean a SpongeBob, whoa.
4355320	4357320	You run out to the bar and you're like,
4357320	4360320	SpongeBob's going to say this and then this robot dick's going to come out,
4360320	4362320	oh my God, this is going to be the best movie ever.
4362320	4364320	You wake up the next day and you're like,
4364320	4367320	I got a fucking dopamine rush off of selling that movie.
4367320	4369320	I'm not going to write it.
4369320	4372320	If Dorothy Parker or Winston Churchill or June of Barnes
4372320	4379320	or all these hilarious, all the Algonquin roundtable writers had Twitter,
4379320	4381320	they wouldn't have written shit.
4381320	4383320	They would just go, oh, I get the dopamine rush
4383320	4386320	of having said one little epigram and made everybody fucking freak out
4386320	4389320	and then I can go to bed and do drugs forever.
4389320	4391320	It's really what we're good at.
4391320	4393320	Again, not to drive it into the ground,
4393320	4398320	but that Sapiens book, it doesn't mention Twitter I don't think once,
4398320	4401320	but it's very glaring, it's throbbing off of that book
4401320	4403320	when it talks about what I was talking about,
4403320	4406320	how we defeated Neanderthals and Homo erectus
4406320	4409320	because of our predilection for gossip.
4409320	4416320	It's eerily uplifting and down trotting
4416320	4421320	to learn that your species is doing all the things that it's currently doing,
4421320	4425320	not as some weird byproduct of sentience,
4425320	4428320	which is this race from animal to God,
4428320	4431320	but that exactly what we're doing right now
4431320	4434320	is exactly the thing that we've always been good at
4434320	4438320	and we tweeted the Neanderthals out of existence.
4438320	4440320	Explain that to me.
4440320	4449320	Well, our ability to understand things beyond 100 people
4449320	4452320	is how we beat all of the other forms of humans.
4452320	4455320	His technical term for it was that Sapiens developed sentience
4455320	4459320	and then subjectivity, the ability to think abstractly
4459320	4462320	and then when you can relate abstract ideas.
4462320	4465320	It's gossip, so if I say to you, I go,
4465320	4468320	hey, did you hear this guy, Jeremy Johnson,
4468320	4473320	like what he said about how we should kick the Neanderthals ass?
4473320	4477320	Our species was able to reach that.
4477320	4479320	Neanderthals couldn't do that.
4479320	4483320	They couldn't go, hey, did you hear what Ugg said about...
4483320	4485320	What?
4485320	4489320	They were arguably more intelligent than us on a local level.
4489320	4494320	We probably, I think we would have really gotten along with them.
4494320	4499320	Could we do a scene where a Homo Sapiens meets in the Neanderthal
4499320	4504320	and tries to gossip with a Neanderthal?
4505320	4510320	Okay, please give us a music cue.
4510320	4512320	Stand up from the corn?
4512320	4514320	Corn husks?
4514320	4516320	No, no, it's more of a scene, right?
4516320	4518320	I'm visiting your cave. I'm coming around.
4518320	4524320	And I think, could I make a suggestion that the...
4524320	4526320	Okay, well, I'll do it. Okay.
4526320	4528320	Hey.
4528320	4530320	Hello?
4530320	4532320	Hello?
4533320	4534320	Hello?
4534320	4536320	What?
4536320	4538320	Hi, sorry.
4538320	4542320	Hi, sorry, don't throw a spear at me.
4542320	4544320	Hey, hi.
4544320	4546320	Yes, hi.
4546320	4548320	I'm Balmar.
4548320	4556320	My species just moved into the field beyond the mammoth's tree.
4556320	4559320	Is that what you call it, by the way? I don't even know.
4559320	4567320	Anyways, I brought a fruitcake, which we do it when we move in.
4567320	4569320	We bring people fruitcakes.
4569320	4571320	Hi.
4571320	4573320	Are you a Neanderthal?
4573320	4575320	Is that racist?
4577320	4578320	Sorry, I don't...
4578320	4580320	Tree?
4580320	4583320	Yeah, tree, the mammoth tree.
4583320	4585320	Wow, you have a huge...
4585320	4586320	Ugg.
4586320	4587320	Yeah.
4587320	4588320	Tree.
4588320	4590320	Ugg, Balmar.
4590320	4591320	Tree.
4591320	4592320	Yes.
4592320	4594320	Yeah, I brought you here. Here, look what I brought you, a cake.
4594320	4595320	Trees.
4595320	4596320	I brought you a cake. No, those aren't trees. That's a cake.
4596320	4597320	Trees?
4597320	4598320	That's a fruitcake.
4598320	4599320	Thank you.
4599320	4600320	Yeah.
4602320	4606320	Hey, look at this art. Will you look at this art?
4606320	4607320	Trees?
4607320	4608320	Yeah, trees, yeah.
4608320	4609320	Thank you.
4609320	4610320	Yeah, yeah.
4612320	4615320	Did you do this? Did you make this? This art?
4615320	4618320	Instead of saying, please.
4618320	4619320	Right.
4619320	4621320	Trees?
4622320	4623320	Thank you.
4624320	4626320	I like you, I like you.
4627320	4628320	Do you like me?
4629320	4630320	No?
4630320	4631320	Why?
4632320	4635320	Just because we're neighbors, we want to get along.
4635320	4638320	Like, God forbid we don't get along.
4638320	4641320	You know, there's a million kinds of fox, there's a million kinds of bear.
4641320	4644320	You know what they say, there could be a million kinds of human.
4644320	4648320	We don't want all but one of us to go extinct.
4648320	4651320	That's not a solution.
4652320	4654320	I think we should get along.
4658320	4661320	Oh, well, okay.
4662320	4664320	Is that supposed to happen?
4664320	4665320	Okay.
4665320	4668320	All right, you're wiping it, just smelling it.
4668320	4672320	Honey, honey, honey, honey, I'm busy.
4675320	4676320	Yeah!
4677320	4678320	I'll...
4681320	4682320	I'll go back...
4682320	4683320	I'll...
4683320	4686320	I'm sorry, I'll go back to the hot rock.
4687320	4688320	Is that your wife?
4689320	4690320	Your mate?
4690320	4691320	Your partner?
4691320	4692320	I don't want to offend.
4692320	4693320	I don't know what you guys do.
4695320	4696320	I'm sorry, that sounded...
4696320	4697320	I don't know.
4701320	4702320	Okay, all right.
4702320	4703320	Well, I feel like...
4705320	4706320	Okay.
4707320	4708320	Is that...
4708320	4709320	Is that a sign of...
4709320	4710320	Is that...
4710320	4711320	Does that mean welcome?
4711320	4714320	Honey, honey, just tell them...
4714320	4715320	Hi.
4715320	4716320	Hi.
4716320	4717320	Hi.
4717320	4718320	Hi.
4718320	4719320	I'm Beaumont.
4719320	4720320	I'm Beaumont.
4720320	4721320	The kids...
4721320	4722320	The kids are upstairs.
4722320	4723320	Yes.
4723320	4725320	Are you just going to keep pooping?
4725320	4726320	Oh, you have kids?
4726320	4728320	Aww.
4728320	4729320	I have kids too.
4730320	4731320	That makes us the same.
4732320	4733320	We both have kids?
4733320	4734320	You want me to...
4734320	4735320	No, no.
4735320	4736320	Get the kids...
4736320	4737320	Keep talking to your friend.
4737320	4738320	I'll go...
4738320	4739320	Hi, I'm Beaumont.
4739320	4740320	So keep doing what I've been doing.
4740320	4741320	Hi, I'm Beaumont.
4741320	4742320	Hi, I'm Beaumont.
4742320	4743320	Hi, I'm Beaumont.
4743320	4744320	Look, it's not like...
4744320	4745320	Don't talk to her!
4745320	4746320	Do not talk to her!
4750320	4751320	Okay.
4751320	4753320	Well, now someone's getting on me.
4753320	4754320	And...
4756320	4757320	You know, I just...
4758320	4763320	I'm going to stand on the outside of the cave.
4763320	4764320	And I can't tell.
4764320	4765320	I'm sorry.
4765320	4768320	Honey, does the ceremony start in five minutes?
4768320	4769320	What happens?
4769320	4770320	Do you guys have a ceremony?
4770320	4771320	Yeah, it's...
4771320	4772320	I'm Beaumont.
4772320	4773320	Hi.
4774320	4775320	Is that okay?
4777320	4778320	Hey, Beaumont, Beaumont.
4778320	4779320	I hate to interrupt, but...
4779320	4780320	What the fuck?
4781320	4782320	It's my trainer.
4782320	4783320	It's my trainer.
4783320	4784320	No, Jesus Christ.
4784320	4785320	Beaumont, Beaumont, look.
4785320	4786320	The fucking guy is...
4786320	4787320	No, no, stand back over here.
4787320	4788320	Sorry.
4788320	4790320	No, you don't have to physically in a matter...
4790320	4791320	Okay, no, I just...
4791320	4792320	No.
4792320	4793320	In the radio play.
4793320	4794320	Okay.
4794320	4795320	You're an asshole.
4795320	4798320	We said you got two minutes to figure out if we got a captain.
4798320	4799320	No, no, no, no.
4799320	4800320	Okay.
4800320	4801320	I got everybody behind Mammoth Tree.
4801320	4802320	I don't think we need to.
4802320	4803320	Give me the spear.
4803320	4804320	I don't think they have a chance.
4804320	4805320	What?
4805320	4806320	Give me the spear.
4806320	4807320	No.
4807320	4808320	Give me the spear.
4808320	4810320	I think he's more of a man than you ever were.
4810320	4811320	All right, no, come on.
4811320	4812320	You don't get the spear.
4812320	4813320	You don't get the spear.
4813320	4814320	Hey.
4814320	4815320	Would a real man be able to do this?
4815320	4816320	Uh-oh.
4816320	4817320	Let's just cut to the chase.
4817320	4818320	Let's cut to the chase.
4818320	4819320	Okay.
4819320	4820320	Here's the spear.
4820320	4821320	Here's the spear.
4821320	4822320	I'm going back.
4822320	4823320	I'm gonna get the guys.
4823320	4824320	I'm going back over to Mammoth.
4824320	4825320	Here's two spears.
4825320	4826320	Thank you.
4826320	4827320	Two spears.
4827320	4828320	Okay.
4828320	4829320	Hey.
4829320	4830320	Run.
4830320	4831320	Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
4831320	4832320	Okay.
4832320	4833320	That's not...
4833320	4834320	Hey.
4834320	4835320	That's something that's crossing the line.
4835320	4836320	Run.
4836320	4837320	Run.
4837320	4838320	Hey.
4838320	4839320	Hey.
4839320	4840320	My house.
4840320	4841320	Get out of it.
4841320	4842320	Okay.
4842320	4843320	I'm out of it.
4843320	4844320	But that's not nice.
4844320	4845320	Do you understand?
4845320	4846320	Yeah.
4846320	4849320	I am looking at you and I'm giving you a stone...
4849320	4850320	Call the police.
4850320	4851320	Call the police.
4851320	4852320	Yeah.
4852320	4853320	Yeah.
4853320	4854320	Yeah.
4854320	4855320	Yeah.
4855320	4856320	Invent.
4856320	4858320	Invent the police and then call...
4858320	4859320	Invent the police.
4859320	4860320	Approaching, marching.
4860320	4861320	Do you guys hear that?
4861320	4862320	Invent the phone.
4862320	4863320	Do you hear that?
4863320	4864320	What happened?
4864320	4865320	Do you hear that sound?
4865320	4866320	Call.
4866320	4867320	Call.
4867320	4868320	That's the sound of 500 Cro-Magnon feet.
4868320	4873320	I'm gonna explain something to you that you're not gonna understand.
4874320	4882320	30,000 years from now, your best shot is being 1% in someone's 23 and me.
4882320	4885320	I would like to make that last as long as possible.
4885320	4887320	Maybe get that to 2%.
4887320	4890320	I'm talking about don't fucking point spears at me.
4890320	4893320	Don't jerk off with your own shit.
4893320	4894320	Okay?
4894320	4896320	Don't jerk off with your own shit.
4896320	4897320	Oh, hell no.
4897320	4899320	And don't talk to your wife that way.
4899320	4900320	You went too far now.
4900320	4901320	Yeah.
4901320	4904320	You've been jerking off on our own shit for 100 million years.
4904320	4907320	100 million years!
4907320	4908320	Well...
4908320	4910320	This morning!
4910320	4915320	You think you can come in here with your complete sentences and not jerking off in poop?
4915320	4919320	I came here with a fruitcake and a fucking last chance.
4919320	4920320	What?
4920320	4921320	All right, Beaumont.
4921320	4922320	Got the boys outside.
4922320	4923320	All right.
4923320	4926320	Use those special things from the Nat Geo documentary that are like...
4926320	4932320	They look like an incense holder, but there's a match in them that throws an arrow farther
4932320	4933320	than any spear can go.
4933320	4934320	It's a spear thrower.
4934320	4935320	At a level.
4935320	4936320	Okay.
4936320	4940320	Well, here we are standing back further than any spear can land.
4940320	4943320	I'm just using our, like, weird highlight yard.
4943320	4945320	I'm gonna hide behind a rock.
4945320	4946320	Let him fly!
4946320	4953320	You guys dead?
4953320	4955320	You extinct?
4956320	4957320	Oh, boy.
4957320	4961320	It's gonna be a long epoch.
4961320	4964320	There are epochs and there are epochs.
4969320	4970320	That was good, though.
4970320	4971320	It was like...
4971320	4974320	I don't think Mel Brooks could have done that better.
4974320	4979320	I think it tells a story about how we got here.
4979320	4983320	But look, I don't think the Neanderthals were, like, dumb.
4983320	4984320	I think that...
4984320	4985320	That's the weird thing.
4985320	4987320	I think that all of...
4987320	4990320	We were humans, so we were all way above chimpanzees.
4990320	4994320	And when you look at chimpanzees, you're like, Jesus Christ, these dudes are really close
4994320	4995320	to, like, their...
4995320	4997320	So, everybody that was human...
4997320	5001320	So, the Neanderthal is like, you know, Bob Neanderthal goes up to Jill Neanderthal and
5001320	5005320	goes, hey, did you hear about Jim over there?
5005320	5009320	And then the other one would go, like, hey, man, don't do that.
5009320	5010320	Well, he's like...
5010320	5011320	Don't do that.
5011320	5012320	That was it?
5012320	5016320	No, I think you get a hundred Neanderthal tribe and then one Neanderthal goes up to
5016320	5019320	the other and goes, like, hey, did you hear about Jim?
5019320	5024320	And if he has heard about Jim and he knows Jim, he's like, yeah, totally.
5024320	5025320	Gotcha.
5025320	5033320	But what we invented was the idea of, like, hey, did you hear about this guy Jim?
5033320	5034320	Who's Jim?
5034320	5038320	Well, anyways, he's this guy from 30 miles away.
5038320	5041320	Maybe you'll meet him one day, maybe you won't.
5041320	5043200	But he's like this, right?
5043200	5046660	And so he's looking at this snake and the snake, like, tries to bite him and he grabs
5046660	5048080	it and he fucking eats it.
5048080	5049080	Jim's a hero.
5049080	5050680	Pass the word along.
5050680	5051680	Jim's the fucking best.
5051680	5059160	In fact, you know, I'm gonna give you actually a piece of fabric that has the word J on it
5059160	5064720	and, like, it means Jim and, like, if we ever come around and we go, like, dude, Jim needs
5064720	5068400	to fucking muscle up, the Neanderthals are giving us trouble, like, can we count on you
5068400	5069400	guys?
5069880	5073560	My hand shakes, my bond, like, we'll leave you in peace.
5073560	5081480	These concepts, the concept of, it's a shirt, don't overreact.
5081480	5084680	A shirt fell off my lap.
5084680	5089320	But it's basically that, it's our ability to believe in things that aren't, that are
5089320	5090320	not real.
5090320	5093440	Weaponizing, weaponizing abstract thought.
5093440	5097760	Here's a way that we would have, that we would love to hang out with Neanderthals right now,
5097760	5102820	is that Neanderthals would be like, hey, can you hang out tomorrow night?
5102820	5105720	And we would say, no, Neanderthal, I have to work.
5105720	5107640	And the Neanderthal would go, why?
5107640	5112320	I just asked if you want to hang out tomorrow night, it's gonna be the best by Neanderthal
5112320	5118640	standards and we'd be like, I know I can't because even though I'm square right now with
5118640	5126040	American Express, like, if I don't keep working, I might get fired and if I do get fired, I
5126040	5127040	won't be able to pay.
5127040	5132520	And Neanderthals are like, whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm asking if you want to hang out tomorrow
5132520	5133520	night.
5133520	5142600	Like, Neanderthals basically styles in Teen Wolf, like, it's every...
5142600	5146120	I take offense to that.
5146120	5150040	Because it's being in the moment, I mean, it's like, we kind of invented being out of
5150040	5151040	the moment.
5151040	5155760	It's kind of sad, like, that we invented the...
5155760	5157280	But it's also...
5157280	5158280	It's just as good too, though.
5158280	5160720	We invented Peter Pan and we invented taxes.
5160720	5165320	Well, I mean, I got a theory wrong, but they were definitely...
5165320	5168320	If you look at the brain patterns and like that type of thing, if you take abstract thought
5168320	5172080	and like things that can distract you from a meditative state, for instance, right?
5172080	5176560	So like regrets, what happened yesterday, what I'm going to do tomorrow, things that
5176560	5179280	you want to happen, the stream of consciousness or whatever.
5179280	5184040	A lot of monks and a lot of serious motherfuckers dedicate 50, 70 years in a cave to get to
5184040	5187040	that level, to even like get rid of that stream.
5187040	5191080	We barely even know what that type of a mind is capable of.
5191080	5193920	We're best able to do 200 hours certification.
5193920	5194920	My man.
5194920	5195920	I mean, yeah, at the very least.
5195920	5196920	Was that a Yupalite?
5196920	5197920	That was a Yup-nation out there.
5197920	5198920	You're trying to create a Yup army around here?
5198920	5203760	I mean, yo, I got eyes on every corner.
5203760	5205720	You overthrowing my Neanderthal tribe?
5205720	5206720	Go ahead, please.
5206720	5207720	Well, it is...
5207720	5212760	Well, anyway, just long story short, so I've studied the yoga and stuff and it's either
5212760	5218720	bullshit or it's not, but what these guys say, what these guys say is that these high
5218720	5226200	level motherfucker monks could do some heavy duty shit, like everywhere from levitation
5226200	5233600	to being able to teleport, to being able to commune with deities or call things to happen
5233600	5234600	to healings.
5234600	5235600	That's what I...
5235600	5236600	That's what I want to do.
5236600	5243120	It's like JC laying down the miracles and shit, which all happen to be classic yoga
5243120	5245480	master miracles, just saying.
5245480	5249320	But anyway, I'm saying, the fact that it was a different brain or a different thought pattern
5249320	5255160	and that we didn't have access to abstract thought and being able to weaponize that,
5255160	5261320	I think Harari overlooks the capabilities of like a fully whatever Neanderthal or yogic
5261320	5263760	or whatever meditative mind.
5263760	5265280	We have no way of knowing that.
5265280	5268720	But if you want to get down to the nitty gritty of it, what I'm scared of, and my takeaway
5268720	5273480	from it was, there was major competition or a reason that these species went after each
5273480	5274480	other.
5274480	5275480	And I think just...
5275480	5276960	Yeah, the reason is us.
5276960	5281960	You know what I'm scared of is like, I'm scared that we're gonna meet an alien planet and
5281960	5284560	that the alien planet is gonna...
5284560	5289640	It's just gonna have like crap monsters that are like...
5289640	5293520	They're like kind of like 90 IQ crap people.
5293520	5296240	And they're like, we come in peace and we're like, okay, we can deal.
5296240	5299200	You're basically a Antiques Roadshow viewer.
5299200	5301320	We're like, we're ready to rock.
5301320	5303080	I don't know why I took a shot at...
5303080	5306360	I just picked a random group of people to take a shot at.
5306360	5308240	It was the randomest...
5308240	5312080	I have no opinion about you if you watch Antiques Roadshow.
5312080	5314680	I'm so sorry.
5314680	5316080	I went so lateral.
5316080	5321760	I'm so gun shy about like picking fights with anybody that are just like fucking just punched
5322480	5328960	like the basically the demographic equivalent of the blind melon girl dressed as a bumblebee.
5328960	5329960	Pow!
5329960	5333920	And it's just like, I don't know where to land this.
5333920	5334920	Bam!
5334920	5339480	Antiques Roadshow viewers, what did they do to deserve this today?
5339480	5341840	I would have gone junior kick boss.
5341840	5346720	Anyways, so like these crab creatures go like, we come in peace and we're like, we come in
5346720	5347720	peace too.
5347720	5348880	And they're like, we love crab stuff.
5348880	5350640	And we're like, we love crab stuff too.
5350640	5351640	Like we're down.
5351640	5354120	Like, how about you send some crab people to our planet?
5354120	5359960	Like we'll shut down some red lobsters during your visit to avoid awkwardness and you will
5359960	5363280	probably have monkey restaurants that you need to shut down.
5363280	5365440	But like, we'll send some emissaries to your planet.
5365440	5369640	I'm worried that our emissaries basically what I'm learning from the Sapiens book is
5369640	5374120	that the thing that will happen, I'm not really worried about this happening.
5374120	5381120	I'm expressing a concern about our species is that we're the kind of species that if
5381120	5387800	that happened and we went to their planet, everything would be kosher until we got to
5387800	5388800	their planet.
5388800	5392400	And they were like, so anyways, here's some flowers, the flowers, oh, these flowers are
5392400	5393400	nice.
5393400	5395400	And the flower was like, don't fuck with me, motherfucker.
5395400	5398640	And we'd be like, whoa, flower just fucking talk shit.
5398640	5402680	And the crab would be like, yeah, sometimes the flowers talk shit.
5402680	5406400	And we'd be like, you got to get your flowers in line, bro.
5406400	5409800	And they're like, no, crabs live among the flowers.
5409800	5412760	And they're like, okay, well, who pollinates the theo?
5412760	5413760	Well, the bees do.
5413760	5414760	Have you met the bees?
5414760	5415760	I'm a bee.
5415760	5416760	I'm a bee.
5416760	5419640	Like, wait, are they smart bees or dumb bees?
5419640	5422440	We don't really judge.
5422440	5423800	They have brains.
5423800	5426000	They're super smart.
5426000	5430040	And we're just like, we will, without even realizing it, we'll be like, dude, like, it's
5430040	5432120	kind of like, remember when I told my story of going to Fiji?
5432440	5434160	I was like, I couldn't just fucking relax.
5434200	5442000	Like, I had these like these people that live in fucking like just live in like what I
5442000	5447280	call garbage and have what I call unreasonable smiles on their face and have been trained
5447280	5450720	by a hotel slash like their thing.
5450720	5453640	And like, all I can do is fucking drink their mystical route.
5453640	5457800	And like, like, I think I'm being a good guy by trying to stir up shit.
5457800	5459440	I'm like, seriously, though, it's fucked up.
5459440	5464080	If the army runs your island, like, like, I'm like, I'm like, it's like gossip.
5464080	5468560	It's like, it's like, well, I can't fucking like, like, take it easy, like, like, like
5468560	5475120	maybe shit that doesn't seem I just I fear that Homo sapiens is that like, it's weird.
5475160	5481000	Now I realize it's weird having read that book that we are that that there's grisly
5481000	5484160	bears and brown bears and black bears and there's all these things.
5484160	5488440	And it's like, no, we're just the only human and that we've actually worked that into our
5488440	5494400	history, that we teach ourselves and he may we go like, yep, there can be only one.
5494400	5499680	No, yeah, if you're a serial killer, like, like, there can be only one and that we would
5499680	5505160	react poorly to an intergalactic community that we that they would meet us at a party
5505160	5509400	if people if Vulcans or anybody came around, they would be like, dude, these people can't
5509400	5514960	handle spiders talking to them, because they they they have it built into them.
5514960	5519880	And they believe that every planet has to have a fucking Kirk on it that like tells
5519880	5521600	the planet what to do.
5521600	5527320	And they they believe that because they're basically like Dexter, they were born in blood
5527320	5532520	and they believe that you have to kill in order to live and they they're like genocidal
5532520	5533520	maniacs.
5533520	5538920	And to the point where their Picasso's don't know that they're genocidal maniacs, like people
5538920	5545120	that believe in not genocide are genocidal maniacs, they just believe in like this pyramid
5545120	5551000	structure that we we're unique in the universe in that regard, because the the leverage that
5551000	5555560	we used on some other planet, there's like a grasshopper species, it's like, yeah, jump
5555560	5556560	really high.
5556560	5561960	And I like, I jumped so high that eventually I didn't become sentient.
5561960	5568120	Like they just became like this really like amazing high jumping dominant species that
5568120	5573560	was like so facile that they kind of like, yeah, they're arguably in charge of the planet.
5573560	5579120	But then they're operating a kind of co cooperation with like a tree that grabs you if you move
5579120	5581960	too fast and eats you with its trunk.
5581960	5584880	And we're gonna show up and go, Come on, what's the fucking episode here?
5584880	5586720	Who do I kill?
5586720	5591160	And they're gonna be like, Whoa, whoa, below Bill, like, no one invited you to this Wild
5591160	5592160	West show.
5592160	5594200	And we're like, No, no, wait, where's the sideshow?
5594200	5595840	Who's who do I lasso?
5595840	5599320	I worry that that's actually I don't worry that that's gonna happen because in our wildest
5599320	5601120	dreams, we'll ever meet anyone from another planet.
5601120	5605680	I'm worried that that's what we are, that that's the disease we have that we actually
5605680	5608720	don't even know we're suffering from it because we have no one to talk to about it.
5608720	5610120	Let me throw you a counterpoint.
5610120	5613840	That's who we were before we got to like a globalized like structure of society that
5613840	5614840	we kind of were.
5614840	5618480	But you can't you can't if you kill everybody, if you kill everybody, you could have talked
5618480	5622040	to we need to we need to clone Neanderthals and we need to talk to him.
5622040	5623040	That's our only hope.
5623040	5630160	But the end of Dexter's, and be what the end of Dexter's, the end, the end of Dexter
5630160	5631160	sucks.
5631160	5632160	All right.
5632160	5637160	My thing is thinking about how many human generations it took to get the ambidextrous
5637160	5638160	sex.
5638160	5640160	I was I was like, tell me more.
5640160	5645880	And then it was like, Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, white, white, how does Dexter end?
5645880	5646880	He gets away with it.
5646880	5653480	He moves away secretly to become the lumberjack.
5653480	5654480	And now he killed.
5654480	5656000	Wait, how is that a bad ending for Dexter?
5656000	5659920	You wanted to just keep killing people?
5659920	5660920	Hicken bottom.
5660920	5663080	I expected more from you.
5663080	5664080	Or are you born?
5664080	5665080	I don't know.
5665080	5666920	I there's only one way to find out.
5666920	5667920	Get them.
5667920	5672720	If he if he breaks all our necks and an Interpol can't catch them.
5672720	5673720	That was Hickenbottom.
5674200	5677160	How would you how would you have ended Dexter?
5682160	5688520	Like after you saw him go become a lumberjack, you were like, well, I clearly they should
5688520	5689520	have done this.
5689520	5690520	Right.
5690520	5691920	I mean, what was the you're eating cake?
5691920	5692920	Well, let him answer.
5692920	5693920	Let him answer.
5696920	5697920	Like that, bro.
5697920	5699920	Something something like actually.
5699920	5701920	Well, we don't have to.
5701920	5702920	All right.
5702920	5706480	Well, on one hand, don't do that to him.
5706480	5707480	On the other hand.
5707480	5708480	Do you know how that feels?
5708480	5714480	See to hear fucking humanity while you're just treading water.
5714480	5716480	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.
5716480	5717480	Come on.
5717480	5723520	He becomes a superhero at the end of at the end.
5723520	5726520	That's a good way to end is that he just goes like now.
5726520	5727520	But you know what?
5727520	5729000	Now I know what I need to do.
5729000	5733240	And he like gets off the payphone like Neo and he just like flies up into the camera.
5733240	5735120	Look, I'm not saying you're wrong.
5735120	5740440	I stopped watching after episode six because as with Lost, I know when I'm being dicked
5740440	5747160	around I know.
5747160	5752840	I know when I'm watching improv and when I'm watching I don't like serialization.
5752840	5763120	If you're going to serialize your show, you better make the most of that fucking season.
5763120	5769520	You better blow my fucking Gen X mind at the end of that season because millennials come
5769520	5773680	in and pitch me shit at my shitty little studio that should just die anyway.
5773680	5774680	So who cares?
5774680	5778920	But like you hear a millennial go pitching, they'll go like, it's like for better and
5778920	5783720	for worse, like in the post Netflix world, the millennial writers would be like, so the
5783720	5789600	show I want to do is Groundhog Day meets Groundhog Day.
5789600	5797680	But here's the thing, but so first season, no Groundhog Day, nothing.
5797680	5799080	It's just a guy shaving.
5799080	5803800	And then he keeps shaving every episode two through 14, he's like, his beard keeps like,
5803800	5806120	it's like, where's something wrong with my beard?
5806120	5811640	And the end of that season, it's like, oh shit, saucer comes down, outer space, it's
5811640	5813560	Groundhog Day planet.
5813560	5820400	Now seasons two through seven, I'm like, wait, what in the fucking entitlement, you kids
5820400	5824640	with your serialization, unbelievable.
5824640	5826600	You already rejected my pitch.
5826600	5832400	Now this is just, this is just mean.
5832400	5833880	It was bad enough the first time.
5833880	5840440	But I want to say also, I'm a convert because I talked shit about Mindhunter, like every
5840440	5843920	episode kept hate watching Mindhunter.
5843920	5847760	I got to the end of Mindhunter, like right, like the last couple episodes, I started getting
5847760	5848760	sucked in.
5848760	5849760	Mindhunter?
5849760	5850760	Mindhunter.
5850760	5851760	Don't Mindhunter.
5851760	5853200	He hunts minds.
5853200	5854200	Don't Mindhunter.
5854200	5858480	He's just a little bit abrasive.
5858480	5859480	Don't Mindhunter.
5859480	5862440	Now Hunter, are you going to behave yourself?
5862440	5863440	Don't Mindhunter.
5863440	5864440	Is he German?
5864440	5865440	What is this?
5865440	5866440	Mindhunter?
5866440	5872800	My point is, if you're going to serialize your television, please, like really understand
5872800	5875200	that the reason you're serializing it is for a reason.
5875200	5877400	It's like Minecraft tiles.
5877400	5882720	Like can you make this mark as like a tile pattern, like because that's a certain amount
5882720	5887600	of bits, or are you going to make it react as if when you place like a 16-bit video game
5887600	5893640	when you're texturing, does your texture, when it's placed next to another texture,
5893640	5897120	okay, does it have to change in order for it to tile properly?
5897120	5898520	It's shit like that.
5898520	5905520	Like Rick and Morty is a, like I would like to think it's like a, like every tile is like
5905520	5907280	you could come in anywhere.
5907280	5908280	I always said that.
5908280	5914560	I also thought that about community, but people said I was wrong, but like it's like my model
5914560	5916480	is crack rocks.
5916480	5923480	Every rock gets you high, every rock makes you want to smoke all the crack.
5923480	5930600	In order, in order of the crack, you want to go back.
5930600	5931600	Podcasting plays that out.
5931600	5935040	Make it, you make a podcast and then people are like, Jesus Christ, now I got to go back.
5935040	5937000	Two hundred episodes of this shit.
5937000	5946280	Oh, speaking of which, so David Cummings, the Canadian horror host of the No Sleep podcast,
5947280	5952120	I believe he told me that his agent reached out and he wants to come on the show, because
5952120	5957200	I think I said, like if I correct me right, what I said was, because I was like, oh, I
5957200	5961640	want to talk about this, like my new passion is this, this guy who sounds like Scott Thompson.
5961640	5967080	He does this horror host thing and then I believe what I said, and if I didn't, I'll
5967080	5971440	say it now, is if you're, if this is going to get back to you, because I'm so tired of
5971440	5978760	me talking about shit that I love and then people like, causing damage with my Lenny
5978760	5986360	breaking the rabbit's neck hugs, like I don't want to have that effect.
5986360	5990480	I don't like that when people are like, Ron Jeremy, you got a banana and you're thinking,
5990480	5992360	you know, that whole effect.
5992360	5997800	I'm not, but if you're out there and you readited Ron Jeremy about the banana thing, don't,
5997800	5998960	it's not your fault either.
5998960	5999960	It's just who we are.
5999960	6003200	We're a fucking horrible species and Neanderthals would, it doesn't matter.
6003200	6004200	It doesn't matter.
6004200	6005200	What's the podcast?
6005200	6009560	David, I think what I said was David Cummings, please, in order to symbolize the fact that
6009560	6014440	I mean you no harm in talking about how I love, how funny it is, that there is a, I'll
6014440	6017240	fly you out first class and you, if you want to be on the show.
6017240	6019120	I don't know his podcast.
6019120	6020880	It's called the no sleep podcast.
6020880	6024160	If you just type in no sleep, you'll get a different podcast that like has two episodes
6024160	6027040	and it's about like Chicago comics or something.
6027040	6030200	There's a podcast called the no sleep podcast.
6030200	6033480	It's like in it's at least 11th season.
6033480	6035820	It's been going on forever.
6035820	6037960	If you go back from the beginning, it's amazing.
6037960	6043680	This guy, David Cummings, he sounds like Scott Thompson and he's just like for the, as the
6043680	6048920	sun goes down on the thing and he's, it's a scary stories podcast.
6048920	6054280	And then he does, he just, it's just people narrating scary stories, but it's so Canadian.
6054280	6055280	It's really funny.
6055280	6057520	It's really fun.
6057520	6061360	It makes me, it gives me like a dose of warmth that I need in a cold world.
6061360	6062600	It's sincere.
6062600	6066840	It is sincere, but that's not to say that you can't enjoy it.
6066840	6070360	Well that's not to say that the podcast doesn't, it takes itself real seriously.
6070360	6071960	It would be mad if you laughed at it.
6071960	6073520	Do you think I'd like it?
6073520	6074520	I think you would.
6074520	6075520	Yes.
6075520	6077440	It's been on for 11 seasons.
6077440	6078440	Yeah.
6078440	6079440	You first telling me now.
6079440	6081240	Well, I just found it.
6081240	6085120	I just found it through another podcast called the creepy.
6085120	6086880	It's just called creepy.
6086880	6093960	John Grills, who's in Minnesota, who, so I mistook him for Canadian, but he emailed
6093960	6098900	me because I became a Patriot subscriber and then I wrote a thing and I had, yeah, whatever.
6098900	6105240	But he, he, his endless plugging of the no sleep podcast, the guy listened to creepy.
6105240	6106240	I don't think you'd like it.
6106240	6111000	I don't want to like, I don't like, more of a no sleep guy to me.
6111000	6112320	All right.
6112320	6117200	I think you, yeah, I don't know.
6117200	6119520	Was that not what you were asking for?
6119520	6121200	I can't hear what you're saying.
6121200	6122200	Yeah.
6122200	6125200	There's a problem on this stage.
6125200	6126200	I wrote this.
6126200	6127200	What did you say?
6127200	6129240	I wish that my.
6129240	6132080	You're like more of a no sleep guy to me.
6132080	6135520	All right.
6135520	6138520	I wish that there was enough of a signal up here that I could.
6138520	6142160	We got to get you a Verizon phone for the stage.
6142160	6147480	I had this guy who does this Creepypasta podcast, Creepy, he, like I told you, if you're a Patriot
6147480	6152720	subscriber at the top level, one of the luxuries, the tears is you can send him a script and
6152720	6155520	he'll read it like as if it's Creepypasta.
6155520	6162680	And I, I sent a thing called, yeah, it's, it's derived from the term copy pasta, which
6162680	6170360	is an aberration of the phrase copy plus paste, implying when you copy and paste a section
6170360	6178400	of text using a computing device, I was hoping now it hit me right in the eye.
6178400	6182600	It did not Jeff threw a thing.
6182600	6190760	This is his I'm plugging him so he won't make this creepy podcast dedicated to sharing
6190760	6199320	the most famous chilling and disturbing creepypastas and urban legends in the world, whether these
6199320	6208200	stories truly happened or simply publications is for you to decide these stories may contain
6208200	6216920	traffic decisions of violence and explicit language, listener discretion is advised.
6216920	6219320	This is my custom one.
6219320	6225200	We're going to listen to another person's podcast.
6225200	6231160	I don't believe that you got like 500 people on stage.
6231160	6234000	You're asking yourself questions and answering them.
6234000	6244520	And then now you're going to play a podcast while we sit here and age to death.
6244520	6250720	While we sit here and age to death.
6250720	6257000	That is a look, I, look, I mean, look, I'm not going to be, I'm not going to defend myself
6257000	6260840	against those barbs.
6260840	6262360	I guess the answer is yes.
6262360	6265400	I was playing this kid's podcast.
6265400	6266800	How long was that clip?
6266800	6267800	Just yeah.
6267800	6270240	Cause we might, it might be fine.
6270240	6273040	Oh, well I can't, I mean, I didn't, I would like to play.
6273040	6275880	Is it five minutes long?
6275880	6278160	Is it 10 minutes long?
6278160	6279160	It's five minutes long.
6279160	6280160	It's five minutes.
6280160	6287080	You're going to make us sit here for five fucking minutes, hold your breath underwater
6287080	6288080	for five minutes.
6288080	6289680	Ask me if it's a long time.
6289680	6290680	That's the metric.
6290680	6298040	Hold your breath underwater for any time with you ever in your life, like, like, like, what?
6298040	6300200	I probably could get like two and a half minutes.
6300200	6304440	We're going to sit here while you're holding, it's a shitty microphone.
6304440	6307440	Because you put a fucking link on the fucking website.
6307440	6309840	You know, if I said put a link, you know, it would take 20 minutes.
6309840	6310840	You know how that goes.
6310840	6311840	Oh, put a link.
6311840	6312840	And then there's 20 dudes with headsets.
6312840	6313840	I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
6313840	6318200	And then it's like, nothing works, nothing works.
6318200	6319640	That's not because they do anything wrong.
6319640	6320640	It just never works.
6320640	6321640	Nothing ever works.
6321640	6322640	You know what works?
6322640	6323640	Holding a fucking thing.
6323640	6324640	Just hold the thing.
6324640	6325640	It always works.
6325640	6326640	It never fucking fails.
6326640	6327640	It doesn't work that great.
6327640	6330640	It doesn't work that great.
6330640	6339160	But still five minutes as spider webs grow on my face and a fucking tumbleweeds blow
6339160	6346840	through the stage as everything I should be doing right now goes through my brain.
6346840	6357920	One thing you should be doing your phone to the microphone, your phone to the microphone.
6357920	6364320	Why is the microphone microphone bigger than your phone?
6364320	6381880	That makes no sense.

6389840	6390840	They already hate me.
6390840	6391840	I love that.
6391840	6392840	They already hate you.
6392840	6398600	We learned that Rob, he has as a heart of a time dealing with him as we do.
6398600	6403600	He's like, he doesn't like it any more than us.
6403600	6405560	We're all just trying to deal with it.

6453040	6454040	What can I say?

6465040	6466040	He says it's five minutes.
6466040	6471320	He says it's five minutes which is probably, it's eight minutes.
6471320	6482320	Your definition of craftsmanship is like, is the next thing I need to understand.
6482320	6491320	I understand that a speaker up to a microphone is lo-fi. What are you?
6491320	6496320	It's enough out of you, Bourne.
6496320	6501320	I'm at the bottom. I don't care. I send you both up. I don't care.
6501320	6505320	I created you both with the same elite covert training program.
6505320	6509320	I held both of your heads underwater until you knew karate.
6509320	6512320	This looks like a job for Dexter.
6512320	6517320	Created by Richard Donner.
6517320	6521320	Jason Boy, you don't know who you are, do you?
6521320	6522320	No, I don't.
6522320	6524320	Come with me.
6524320	6533320	Oh, no. I hope you don't wrap me in plastic and indulge the weird self-loathing
6533320	6542320	showtime audience in pseudo-HBO levels of nihilism.
6542320	6553320	Maybe we're two. We can't abide HBO, but we're not threatened by weeds.
6553320	6556320	Or maybe we just get both. That's half the audience.
6556320	6559320	Just give me everything. What do you want? Everything or give me everything?
6559320	6562320	Give me the animal planet. I don't give a fuck.
6562320	6567320	So you don't want to know who you are, Jason? Bourne?
6567320	6569320	Please, Dexter, tell me.
6569320	6571320	I was going to show you.
6571320	6572320	Oh, no. Tell me.
6572320	6576320	Let's go back to Christmas 1977.
6577320	6579320	Oh!
6579320	6586320	There you are, sitting, waiting for Santa Claus to come down the chimney.
6586320	6590320	Oh, I always loved my...
6590320	6593320	Oh! Oh! Oh!
6593320	6598320	See the bullet holes forming in your ass?
6598320	6600320	Dexter!
6600320	6603320	Dexter, why did that happen?
6603320	6604320	Because I'm...
6604320	6606320	Dexter!
6606320	6608320	Okay. Are you leaving?
6608320	6610320	He's leaving. Now I'm in the past.
6610320	6612320	And the award...
6612320	6615320	I just have to haunt my past for a moment.
6615320	6617320	The award for best...
6617320	6618320	What?
6618320	6625320	Emmy award-winning finale goes to Super Dexter.
6625320	6629320	Yeah.
6629320	6635320	With an honorary mention to a phone being played into the microphone,
6635320	6637320	which I think comes in a close second.
6637320	6641320	It gives us something to do.
6641320	6643320	I, you know...
6643320	6645320	I could run you through a plank set while he plays it.
6645320	6649320	Hey, we sometimes do a segment that does stuff that we do stuff in.
6649320	6652320	Yeah, it's definitely too late.
6652320	6655320	Should I read too far into us never playing D&D anymore?
6655320	6656320	No, don't read into it.
6656320	6658320	Okay, that's good to know.
6658320	6663320	No, I don't need the show to be, like, on the rails or anything.
6663320	6666320	I just need to know it's not about me being bad.
6666320	6668320	No.
6668320	6670320	I don't do Oz.
6670320	6673320	Cliffhangers!
6673320	6674320	Hey!
6674320	6675320	Spencer's a bad person.
6675320	6676320	Hey! Hey, wait!
6676320	6677320	Spencer's a bad...
6677320	6678320	Wait!
6678320	6679320	Stop the show!
6679320	6680320	Okay.
6680320	6681320	Back those credits up!
6681320	6682320	I was trying to stop the show.
6682320	6684320	What's happening?
6684320	6685320	What?
6685320	6686320	Go ahead, Rob.
6686320	6687320	Spencer!
6687320	6689320	Make another human feel better about themselves.
6689320	6690320	Go ahead.
6690320	6691320	Yeah, try that.
6691320	6693320	Use your powers for good!
6693320	6697320	For once in your fucking life.
6697320	6700320	Can bleach help anyone?
6700320	6705320	I know it can get dirt off a counter, but as dirt, I'm just asking.
6705320	6708320	Have you ever fed anyone?
6708320	6710320	Because I'm part food.
6710320	6712320	I'm dirt.
6712320	6718320	I'll explain the metaphor in the alley when you're driving me home.
6718320	6725320	Cliffhangers!
6725320	6730320	Thank y'all.
6730320	6735320	Let's give it up for Rob's job.
6735320	6738320	Dave Kline.
6738320	6741320	Spencer Crittenden.
6741320	6743320	I'm your comptroller, Jeff Davis.
6743320	6752320	Give it up for your mayor, Dan Harmon.
6752320	6753320	It's a little less than for Rob.
6753320	6755320	It's good to be back here at the...
6755320	6756320	What did you call it?
6756320	6758320	The Diamond Tap TIE Fighter?
6758320	6760320	The Diamond Tap TIE Fighter.
6760320	6761320	We love you all.
6761320	6762320	Drive fast.
6762320	6763320	Take chances, everybody.
6763320	6765320	Never again or always.
6765320	6766320	We don't know.
6766320	6767320	I love you.
