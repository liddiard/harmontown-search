0	21000	What's up Dynasty typewriter? Who wants Rob Schwab? Who wants Spencer Crittenden? Who wants
21000	40260	to talk shit cause Dan Harmon is late? Here we go. Harmon town is now in session. Dan
40260	45440	Harmon's not here. Let's fucking do this. Let's find out what life is like without that
45440	54240	fucking piece of human garbage. Oh shit. Dan Harmon is so late. How late is he? Dan
54240	62720	Harmon is so late that we started the show without him. Yeah. So we're talking backstage
62720	81800	about that. I kind of feel like the show doesn't even need him. We don't have to do
81800	88360	a show. It doesn't have to be called a harm in town. I think it's better without him.
88400	96240	I say, I say if Dan even peers out of a curtain and says he's going to be here. Oh shit. The
96240	108000	mayor of Dan Harmon town is Dan Harmon. This mother fucker's late to his own.
118360	125720	Non-punctuality is my reality. I'm going to be as late as I can be. How late? I'm so late.
125720	131160	Your mama's kitties couldn't keep up with me if they spurted enough milk. How late? I'm so late
131160	136680	that your daddy's dick couldn't stand up to me if he had a hit. How late? How late? I said
136680	144080	sundial. Fuck your mama. So long she's a crocodile. How early? How early can be? Fuck your mama so hard
144080	151680	to Louisiana. None of these rhymes make that much sense. What's your excuse for being late?
151680	162640	Well, I was at your mama's house doing everything I could. Predictable. My Uber driver, Toby,
162640	169560	I'll be right there. And then he had to dry his hair. He took me down to the one Oh one. And then
169640	176200	he turned around and said, let's have some fun. Which up the 405 to the 308 said, Oh shit,
176200	182920	you're going to be late. How late? Late as ever. Fuck your mama like a sweater.
185640	193320	All right. Look, I did. People came here from all over the country. I called I called an Uber at
193320	199080	seven 25 from fucking bird. How late? How late?
203800	209000	So late that every clock's hand goes around. Every time I lost your mama's push.
209000	217800	All right. Welcome to harm and town. Everybody
221560	226520	how many left? What's the shot clock on harm and towns? How many more shows do we have before I
226520	236040	guess four or four or five? Four to go. Seven. Doesn't matter. All right. Let's look at what
236040	239720	do we get? I guess it changes things now that you live way up in Valley village. I got the,
239720	244200	oh, was everybody watching this football game? There was a cat on the football field. The cat
244200	249720	came out. That poor cat. All right. Look, how does a cat end up on a football field?
250760	259160	So I'm watching the cat end up on a football field. Who brings a cat to a game?
259160	266280	There's a see ya. All right. Packer fan. I would guess the Bengals.
274200	278440	So a cat's on a football field. Oh, I'm sorry. Do you, do you want my input?
280440	286360	I relate for the syllables. Yeah. Well, it just, this is not your, you've sacrificed your, your
286440	295880	titular duties. Well, careful what you wish for. So what did the cat do Dan? What happened to the
295880	307800	cat? The cat walked. No, nothing. No reaction to the word walked. You guys don't have a funny
307800	318360	reaction to the word walked. The cat walked on. It walked on. It walked on guys. Come on, react.
318920	321400	I have the, it didn't, it didn't walk in.
323720	335960	The cat walked on the football field. Tell us your cat story, Dan.
336520	339160	So it's America's best story. This is going to be great.
343960	344520	How great.
350360	355000	Wait. Okay. Let's back it up. Why were you watching football in the first place? You're
355000	359880	not, you're not, you're not a sporty. It's just, it's a TV. It's like, what is in a bar
359880	365240	these days except mirrors and TVs? Like there was a thing and there was a cat on the TV.
365880	371240	So the cat's like walking across the field and there's like, everyone's cheering and there's,
371240	377000	it's this black cat. And I'm thinking like, I don't think that that cat lives in a football arena.
378120	382120	It was very fat. They were showing like closeups of the cat. It had like a double chin.
383880	390760	And I'm like, okay, I bet a football fan, because we not, like, and I, I respect the athletes.
390840	395480	They're very superstitious people. I get that when you push yourself to the physical limits,
395480	400200	like you're going to be superstitious. I don't look down on that. If it's, honestly,
400200	404760	it's you competing with God, you're going to be superstitious. Like, you're like,
404760	410120	I'm a linebacker. There's nothing between me. There's no commercial way to measure my ability.
410120	414680	No way to do it. Yeah. Like, like, so if your socks, you know, famously like athletes, they're
414680	418760	like, Oh, I know. I only wear these socks. They're very superstitious people. Superstitious.
418840	425400	Sailors and athletes and actors. Very superstitious. So I would say like the odds are probably the
425400	430520	opposing team. I think that they, I think that there was a stunt. How does a black cat end up
430520	436680	running onto a football field? Was it fully black or did it have white shoe? No, totally black cat.
436680	440920	What city was this in? What was the home of stadium? Does anyone know the answer to that question?
441800	444760	Oh, so the Giants versus the Cowboys with it.
447640	453400	Thanks, Steve. Okay. Okay. So a black cat crossed the Giants,
453400	457160	Meadowlands, wherever the fuck that field is. I just got to imagine that would play hell with
457160	463080	any football player worth their salt. Like if the game was worth anything and that if you were an
463080	467160	opposing team, you'd be like, also, don't you think there'd be an arms race? You'd be like,
467160	471960	you know how we get these fuckers? I heard that so and so on the opposing team is like
471960	479480	really superstitious. Like you should step on a crack. Just bring your aunt Stacey's cat in a
479480	488520	bag. You put the quarterback under a ladder. And I don't think any fan gets into an arena with a
488520	494440	cat in a bag. I don't think that any cat like lives in a football arena and then ends up on
494440	499240	the field. I believe that one of those teams, it isn't a Jersey though. Don't the Giants play
499240	503640	in Jersey? Yeah. So it's fucking Jersey, baby. You don't, you don't know what's going to go on
503640	509720	there. You just think that new Jersey, they're lax culture. You don't think they're, you think
509720	514760	their football arena is more prone to have just like, I don't know, like fucking, okay. Here's
514760	523640	what I think. You said the cat was fat. It was very fat. How fat was he? It was fat enough that
523640	528760	it had like a perceivable double chin. And that like, if you were watching it and you were a cat
528760	537240	person or even an animal person, your heart went like, Oh, I, I heard, I heard the fat was so fat
537240	544680	that when it stands in a street corner, the cops y'all break it up. The cat, the cat. That's how
544680	552200	fat. Rob, Rob, how fat was that cat? Uh, it sounded like it had a double chin.
553560	558600	It had a double chin. Yeah. Yeah. And how do you, how do you tell? I didn't see the video. They showed
558600	562920	like, cause the thing is they got so many, they're like, you can see it in the live moments. They're
562920	567000	like, good cat. And the sports casters are so excited because the cat was like running in the
567000	569960	end zone. And so of course the sports casters are doing their job. They're going like, Oh,
569960	573960	look at his double chuckle back. Like, you know, like, like the cat's like running from the people
573960	577720	that are trying to get it out of the field. And they're like, Oh, that cat's got a good quick,
577720	581960	quick change or whatever. Like, like, like they're, they're having the time of their lives. They live
581960	589800	for this shit. He came back out dressed as a clown. And, uh, but then, but then coming back
589800	594040	from commercial, then they had all these instant replays. They go to the slow-mo footage of the
594040	599480	cat galloping and it's, it's got a little bit of saliva coming off its lips, which is not quite
599480	603240	enough for you to go. Oh, it's a rabid cat, but it was just enough that like, Oh, that cat's going
603240	608360	under a great deal of stress. Like I just, if the cat hadn't been overweight, I would have been
608360	615080	like, ah, fine. It's like a cat. That's like, it's, it's got its own thing going on. It was clearly a
615080	621640	fat cat. It sounds like your cat shaman. It had been imported into that arena. Somebody got rid
621640	626840	of that cat. Somebody brought that cat in there. If you looked at that cat and you're like, that
626840	634840	cat has a name. That cat like loves a certain food. It was sad. Somebody fucked, somebody brought
634840	642280	that cat in there and let it out of a box. That's all I want to say. Do you think a fat cat is
642280	647960	worse luck than a skinny cat? And I just say, I just think that those sports people, it's like,
647960	651240	look at all those sports people. They get all excited. Oh, there's a cat in the field. Yeah.
651320	654680	That's a, that's your invitation. Don't be a sports person.
656680	661480	Go home and play with your cat. You love cats so much. Isn't that delightful? Oh,
661480	668040	there's a cat out there. Go home. Stop tearing it up. I heard that. I heard that. I heard that
668040	676760	cat was so fat. The cat was so fat that it's cat food was made by Halliburton.
677080	684200	Halliburton. There's no guest tonight, folks. This is all you got.
688280	692200	I wrote this down in my, uh, what do you know? Guess Rob Schwab is a guest.
692200	693560	Let's give it up for Rob Schwab.
697880	701640	Rob, Rob, what's up with that creep show? What's up with the creep show?
702600	709080	Oh, uh, the finale was last week and, uh, we, they got picked up for a second season and I'm
709080	717320	hoping I can come back for another episode. That's great. You get a second season.
718040	721480	I didn't get a second season, but I'm hoping I can come back. All right.
721480	737320	That cat was so fat. How fat was he? Uh, um,
737320	741080	he became like some sort of viral sensation because everyone loved it.
742680	747400	Do you think in the future, uh, I was at, I was at this bar and I was like,
747400	754760	God damn. Hey, uh, could I charge my phone? Getting below 20%. I'm in the red. Okay.
755400	759560	Bartender. Yeah. Is it an Android? No, of course not.
761800	766600	Civilized human being. Like I'm not, not ready to acquiesce to that.
766600	771480	You're not, you're not Klingon. Yeah. Uh, oh no, I can't. What about that?
771480	775880	I'm in the red and, uh, my friend goes like, it's fine. 19%. You're fine.
776520	778280	And then I was like, this is like camping.
781480	785000	It's the new camping. Like there'll come a time when there's no wilderness.
785000	787400	The new camping is going below 20% on your iPhone.
787400	792280	You'll go out in the woods or not. There won't be woods anymore. You'll go out to a strip mall
792280	798200	and you'll have 20% battery and you'll tell your kids like, you kids, uh, do you know how to deal
798200	804280	with, uh, only having 20% battery? And your kids will be like, eh, I want to be a different gender
804280	809480	with a USB port. And you're like, you can't be a different gender. You're going to be the gender
809480	817400	you were born and you're going to learn to make a flashlight with only 20% of your battery.
819000	824200	Yeah. Cause you got to decide how much candy you can crush until you get back to the, uh,
825320	828680	to the, to the, to the power. Do you think, do you think the definition of camping
829240	834040	will change as we evolve as a society? Do you think it'll eventually become like,
834040	837480	Hey, I went camping the other day. Me. Will it eventually mean
837480	843160	how much did you go camping? Well, I mean, back in the day,
843160	845240	camping was just, that's where you lived.
855800	861160	I mean, we graduated to like building a house outside our tent and then I moved in.
861160	864680	Yeah. It's just like, like when, when did we start calling it homelessness?
864680	869800	Yeah. Yeah. We started, we became bullies. Yeah. And we're like,
869800	873400	how good does your tent have to be before people are like, that's a house.
874360	879640	I think it mad at you. Like if you're in the lawn, come on, quit it. I made a tent and it's got
879640	884840	a square roof with gutters in case it rains. And then the rain goes off. That's called a house.
884840	890440	How you anti camper piece of shit. But then you got to start building it out of different materials.
891160	896040	Like you can't just build your new house out of straw. But what if, if, if houses,
896040	902120	if houses become made out of lasers that just repel everything, then if you make your house
902120	906280	out of bricks, could, will that be camping? That'll be the new 10. That'll be the new 10.
906280	910760	It's like, Oh, kid, like the cub scouts will go out and they were like, everybody make a brick
910760	916680	with your 3d printer. Now make a house. This is, Oh, we're, we used to be in nature. Hoyo,
917080	922600	hoyo, hoyo. Like they'll, they'll like, they'll be all racist and shit. No, I don't fucking like,
922600	928360	Oh, don't forget your screen door. Then you get your badge for being a Navajo. Like, like, they'll,
928360	933560	it'll, it'll all be downgraded. No, I agree. Okay. Thank you. Good. It's good to be on the
933560	939880	same page once in a while. Speaking of, of, of housing and tents and whatnot, have you got,
939880	946120	uh, in your giant castle, do you have furniture yet? Are you? Not really. And, and, and, and,
946200	950040	you couldn't, well, you're still sleeping on the air mattress. It's kind of like,
950040	953880	it's not air mattress. Now we got a mattress in a box frame, but we don't have a bed frame,
953880	962440	a mattress instead of a mat. Right. A matador. Yeah. That's the old days. Before, before,
962440	968040	before Oprah at the Oscars, like shit, that's times up. No more matadors. You're sleeping on
968360	972040	mattresses. Oh boy.
974360	981560	Looking good. Looking good. Looking real fucking good. I plan, I planned my estate today.
985160	990200	Looking real good. Why does he wait to bring the vodka out? Why is that a reveal? Yeah. Or,
990200	995480	or, or is he timing? We're pacing the show. Okay. I plan, I planned my estate today.
996280	1002440	Yeah. Like what the book told you to do last week. That's right. How much weight should I
1002440	1006280	give death in my life? The answer is as much as it earns. I'm sorry, Dan. I missed that. You,
1006280	1010920	you do what to your estate? I went to, I planned it. Plan. Meaning you did what to your estate?
1010920	1017720	I planned it. I told that estate, Hey motherfucker, I'm going to fucking plan you. Then I'm going to
1017720	1022120	take you. I'm going to double suplex you. You heard me estate. I'm coming to get you. I'm Ricky,
1022120	1029880	the nature man. Hey estate. You think you can have me. I'm going to have you. I'm going to bequeath
1029880	1041240	you. I'm going to take you from the top ropes. It's me, the decedent. Dan Harmon, the decedent's
1041240	1045080	going to take you. I'm going to come up from the front. I'm going to bend you in half. Hey estate.
1045080	1052760	I'm going to plan you. I'm going to put you in a trust. I'm going to deduct your exemptions.
1052760	1058680	What's the, what's the difference between like planning your estate and just having a will?
1058680	1068280	Is that the same thing? It's the same. It's a little confusing. The will, a will is kind of
1068440	1077960	uh, governmental. Like everybody has the right to have a will. I'm not sure about wills. Like
1080600	1087400	trust. This sounds like a real, uh, will they, won't they? I know in terms of, in terms of like
1087400	1096120	coding, thank you. Trusts. Four more shows left. Trusts supersede wills. So your will,
1096120	1101240	like when you die, it's sort of a court-based thing. So there's, there's no need to fuck with
1101240	1109000	a trust unless somebody like raises a ruckus and goes like, you know, you see it famously like when
1109000	1115080	what's your name, uh, playmate lady, you know, had a reality show. What was her name?
1116280	1121880	Correct. Anna Nicole Smith. Like, like it's a classic case of like, like somebody's like the,
1121880	1127480	oh, the, the, the husband leaves everything to her, but then the family will contest the will
1127480	1132760	because it's like open to be contested. But if there's a strong enough trust, like there's
1132760	1139240	nothing can be contested. Uh, trusts are like, they're more iron clad. They're done with people
1139240	1144280	that like fucking stamp the shit and it's done. And like no court's going to like overrule them.
1144280	1148840	So as long as everything's in order. So, you know, are we, are we getting a piece of this action?
1149160	1154760	Uh, I sh, shrub is if, if,
1156840	1163640	like what, what, what, but only if Cody and I die in the same bus. Okay. Okay. No,
1163640	1169640	and don't tell Rob that. Don't tell Rob that. No, no, no. But shrubs, he's going to rent you a
1169640	1175960	fucking bus. But if, if Cody and I die together, shrub has to deal with so much, uh,
1176120	1183880	uh, shop becomes a trust, a trustee. He has to deal with so much prison reform and autism charities
1183880	1188360	that like, you don't even want to, like it'll be me laughing at you from the grid. I get it. I get
1188360	1195160	it. Like make sure those guys don't suffer too much. Right. Thanks. Have fun with my money.
1195160	1201400	You fucking slob. That's good. Yeah. That's a good bit. You know,
1201400	1207000	yeah. You're allowed to refuse. I said to the lady, I'm like, can you just name any Yahoo
1207000	1211800	your trustee? Can I just see a dude on the sidewalk and be like, that's my trustee. Like,
1211800	1216280	like Sylvester Stallone and rhinestone cowboy. Like you're just like that guy. And she's like,
1216280	1221320	yeah, you can, but then he has a right to refuse it. But you could just like pick somebody out and
1221320	1227640	go, that's my, I want my trustee to be Jeremy Piven. And like, he might not refuse. You could
1227720	1233800	just like use your will. You can be like, I want Jeremy Piven to get like a book of like what
1233800	1239000	you're supposed to do. Or do they just like, okay, you can do anything. I mean, a trust is basically
1239000	1244520	it's like coding. Like you can program anything you want and it's, you're not allowed to, for
1244520	1251240	instance, tell people to do anything illegal. You can't obviously say, uh, I leave a million
1251240	1257880	dollars to Rob, but only if he kills Spencer. But then again, you don't just get the million
1257880	1262200	dollars. Like they'll just say, well, you don't get the million dollars, but you don't have to
1262200	1268680	kill Spencer. They're like, if you kill Spencer, you go to jail. Like I can't, I can't supersede
1268680	1278360	the law, but I can make you do stuff for money. Rob, I can say you have to spend $10 million
1279080	1284840	in 48 hours. It's weird. The other thing that's weird is like this whole thing of exemption. So
1284840	1293240	there's this thing called the estate tax. And, um, uh, it's like right now, apparently courtesy of
1293240	1299640	Trump, it's like double what it was, which is comical because what it was was like six million
1299640	1305480	or $5 million. It's like, that's the number that if that's what you're worth when you die,
1306200	1313640	none of your shit is taxed that you're bequeathing. But if, uh, now because of Trump, it's doubled.
1313640	1321640	Ooh, score one for rich people. Like what? But like, like, so now it's like, currently it's like
1321640	1327720	$11.4 million. If you die and you're worth less than that, you don't have to worry about 40% of
1327720	1334440	your money getting taken. If you die with $11.39 million, it's all good, man. Give it to whoever
1334440	1341080	you want. None of it's taxed. $11.4 million. Boom. 40% right to the government as you go.
1341080	1345560	I'm like, I don't care. I'm liberal. I gave my money half of my money away when I was alive.
1345560	1350920	Who cares? But you think about Cody, right? If I die, I want Cody to be set up. I don't want
1350920	1358120	Cody to find out almost half of all the shit like is gone. So then they go like, Oh, here's how that
1358120	1362120	works. You put it in this box and you put it in that box. So you put in that box. It's just so
1362120	1370440	weird. It almost seems like like senators, like lawmakers, they must like campaign and then get
1370440	1375800	poor people's votes by going like, and here's another thing. If I'm elected, I'm going to make
1375800	1380600	rich people like when they die, they're going to have to give half their money away. And then
1380600	1384680	everyone's like, that's an easy thing to root for. I'm never going to have that much money because
1384680	1390440	fuck rich people. And then it's cool. I get that. It makes sense. You vote for that person. That
1390440	1400280	person gets a chair and like the Congress. But the thing is, then like, it's just like this whole
1400280	1404440	system of lawyers and accountants and things underneath are like, yeah, but how are we really
1404440	1410040	going to deal with that? And the answer is, well, the definition of this is then and it's just like,
1410040	1415880	it just all settles anyway. It's like you can't actually create revolution through anything.
1415960	1422360	Good night, folks. I just found that by like, I'm just like, like, like my, this person was like,
1422360	1429240	because I'm panicking now. It's like, I got to make sure Mike Mendel was healthier than me.
1430120	1437160	And I don't even know what, like, I hope his house was in order. But like, my God, if there was ever
1437160	1442280	a sign, it's like, you got to get your shit in order. Like, make sure that tomorrow, God forbid,
1442280	1447880	something happens to you. Like, God damn it, make sure everything don't let your last thought be,
1447880	1455320	oh, my God, Cody's gonna get kicked out of her house. And, and so like, you just like,
1455320	1460840	and then you go in and you're like learning about this whole Tron scape of like how your money gets
1460840	1466920	divided. And it's just creepy and weird. I don't understand our species. I think we're fucking dumb.
1467800	1473400	I think we're vile people. I don't think we ever do anything in good faith. I think we're kind of
1473400	1479720	like shitty animals that have been cursed with sentience. Yeah, that's probably it.
1481000	1490200	I think you're totally right. We're shitty animals that know we're gonna die someday. Yeah.
1490200	1496840	I mean, that's it. We call that intelligence. Like, we go like, we go like, hey, how come dogs
1496840	1502440	are so dumb? Well, don't they know they're gonna die? Dummy. Like, well, how much smarter are they
1502440	1506040	if they know they're gonna die? No, if they knew they were gonna die, they'd be writing books.
1506040	1512280	Yeah. They'd certainly be worse at fetch. They'd be like, all right, I brought you the ball back.
1512280	1516600	Yeah. What's in it for me? I'm gonna go climb dog Everest. I'm gonna paint a picture.
1516600	1523640	Yeah. I'm gonna lay in the sun and I'm gonna fucking shit on myself. I heard about this Hawaii.
1523640	1529160	Hey, Dan, did you know, Spencer, Rob, that I ran into a couple people today or over the last couple
1529160	1534440	days that people have flown from all over the country to like, to be here. Like, prove it.
1536440	1541880	Jersey? Where else? Texas. Jersey, Texas, Oklahoma.
1542280	1543640	Florida.
1543640	1544200	Florida.
1544200	1545960	Beowulf's not a state.
1546920	1548040	Just yelling at your homework.
1550760	1552040	Montana. Dear heavens.
1554120	1559160	Sorry. This is electricity. Don't be afraid. No. Where? Billings? Where are you from?
1560280	1565640	Bozeman. Well, Dan, who came the father? Who's father from... Australia.
1566520	1569880	But you didn't come here for this. You came probably for like, to do fun things.
1572680	1576520	Oh, shit. Get up here. Get up here.
1577400	1580120	Well, the Australian didn't necessarily...
1582680	1584200	Yay. Yay.
1586200	1587560	All right. What's your name, Madam?
1587560	1588520	Omnia.
1588520	1590200	Omnia. Omnia.
1590200	1592520	We've met before. Don't worry about it.
1592520	1593080	That's fine.
1593080	1594120	It was back at Nodmelt.
1594120	1594600	I don't.
1595320	1596120	You were very drunk.
1597000	1597640	But, yeah.
1597640	1599080	Well, you were very unmemorable.
1599720	1601960	Oh, shit.
1601960	1604040	How unmemorable is she?
1604040	1605160	Welcome to America.
1606760	1611080	This is insane. This podcast has been a part of my life since it started.
1612120	1613080	It's insane.
1613080	1614760	Is your mic on, by the way?
1614760	1615720	No, it's not on.
1615720	1618120	Shall I try this one? Is it working?
1618120	1618840	I'm sure it's not.
1618840	1621880	We went to this previously, by the way. I heard the podcast last time.
1621880	1623160	I think the second one works.
1623160	1627400	It was going fine, but one of the mics, the monitors are on.
1628360	1628840	There we go.
1629000	1630600	But the thing is, they're both on.
1631880	1633000	I noticed that listening to them.
1633000	1633720	So you're good.
1635320	1637080	But wait, you seem very young.
1637080	1638760	Twenty-three.
1638760	1640360	Literally turned 23 on this trip.
1641000	1645720	If you've been following, since childhood, you've been following the podcast.
1645720	1647160	You're like a Harman Town baby.
1647160	1648840	Well, I'm a community baby.
1648840	1651960	I was a fan of community around about when it started,
1651960	1655400	and then I became a fan of the podcast the moment it started,
1655400	1658120	and I got to see it while it was at Nodmelt, which was huge for me.
1659000	1662840	And then it's kind of weird now I'm on stage and I'm kind of shaking a little bit.
1662840	1663640	It's awesome.
1663640	1665720	I go to sleep to this podcast every night.
1665720	1667080	Like, no cap.
1667080	1667720	So do I.
1667720	1668200	Yeah.
1672840	1674440	How is that joke, Matt?
1676120	1677880	It took eight years for that joke to...
1680680	1682360	It's like such a classic Carson.
1683480	1685720	I go to sleep to this podcast right now.
1685720	1686520	Me both, brother.
1689480	1690200	Go on, Abhir.
1690200	1695800	No, I was just saying, it's a parasocial thing.
1695800	1698600	It's like I know you guys, even though I don't know you guys.
1698600	1702120	Like, the fact that I came to the show last week,
1702120	1704040	because while we were here, I thought, like,
1704040	1707960	because I came here specifically for this, I tried to make it so I got two in,
1707960	1710920	just because we can only do two weeks, so I tried to get it.
1710920	1711640	So we came to do so.
1711640	1714600	I was there last week, and I'm here this week,
1714600	1716680	and I'm so glad I got Shrab both times.
1716680	1717320	This is the best.
1717320	1719320	Yeah, fuck yeah.
1719320	1719880	Yes, thank you.
1719880	1720680	Double Shrab.
1720680	1722520	You're gonna get those Shrab episodes.
1722520	1723080	I get it.
1723080	1723720	Of course, of course.
1723720	1725000	They're the iconic ones.
1725000	1726840	Yeah, came all the way.
1726840	1727800	Yeah, I get it.
1728600	1729240	I get it.
1729240	1729480	Yeah.
1730680	1732040	And so you're from London.
1732040	1733000	Some people like me.
1736120	1738520	I left you all my money if Cody dies.
1738520	1738920	Okay.
1738920	1739320	All right.
1741640	1745240	But you first have to share it with all autistic people and prisoners.
1747560	1751560	Amanya, you're just simply on a little holiday here?
1751560	1754840	Yeah, it was my birthday, and I knew Harmontown was ending,
1754840	1758600	so I had to get my final trip to Mecca in kind of thing.
1759640	1761160	But also, I'm not...
1761160	1764280	I flew from London, but I'm from Cambridge, actually.
1764280	1764760	All right.
1764760	1765400	That's fancy.
1766920	1767960	It sounds like...
1767960	1769320	Did you go to school there?
1769320	1770040	Are you on Oxford Bridge?
1770040	1771240	No, I'm a local.
1771240	1771880	I'm a local.
1771880	1774280	I could have gone, but, you know.
1774280	1774680	Right.
1774680	1775480	Yeah.
1775480	1777000	You're 23 now, you said?
1777000	1777640	I am, yeah.
1777640	1780840	What's it like to be a 23-year-old European?
1782280	1783800	Give me a taste of that life.
1785240	1788280	Are you a Washington student loans or...?
1788280	1790200	No, I skipped all of that.
1790200	1794600	I just went into being self-employed and making my own art and stuff.
1797080	1797800	How does that work?
1797800	1799080	Are you comfortable doing that?
1802280	1802760	Well, I don't...
1802760	1803560	I mean, do you pay your rent?
1803560	1806360	I'm having a bit of a yearly crisis of confidence right now,
1806360	1808600	so comfortable, I'm not quite sure.
1808600	1809640	You yearn for more.
1810360	1812600	Yeah, I yearn for a pass.
1812600	1816520	Right now, with the internet, it seems like everything's got easier,
1816520	1818440	but actually, everything's...
1818440	1821320	Especially because I didn't go to uni, it's gotten much harder.
1821320	1824120	And as a 23-year-old, I'm right between the millennials
1824120	1827800	that have been dealt a hard kind of hand and the Gen Zs,
1827800	1829880	who basically have no idea what they're doing.
1829880	1832760	So I'm kind of right in the middle of that limbo.
1833720	1834360	Yeah.
1834360	1835000	It's no fun.
1835080	1838440	What is your dream gig?
1839080	1839880	To be a musician?
1840680	1841400	Are you a singer?
1841400	1841720	You play...
1841720	1844520	Sing a songwriter, producer, Gen Z.
1844520	1845400	We've got to be everything.
1845400	1846680	You've got to be your marketer.
1846680	1848280	You've got to be a YouTuber.
1848280	1849320	You've got to do your Instagram.
1849320	1851640	You've got to produce your own music, write your own music.
1851640	1852760	So I do all of that.
1852760	1856360	They're going to call you guys the aerosol generation.
1856360	1859640	You've got to be diversified in mutual fund.
1859640	1861560	You've got to be scattered across the...
1862520	1866280	Because you've got to be guarded against automation replacing anybody.
1866280	1868600	We used to joke when I was your age.
1868600	1872120	It was like, obviously, they're never going to replace writers.
1872120	1873000	So we're safe.
1874040	1875880	It's really not really...
1875880	1876360	It's like...
1878280	1879240	No, I don't think so.
1879240	1884120	Well, I mean, well, the thing is is that the next Dan Harmon is going to be...
1884120	1884920	A robot.
1884920	1885480	Writing...
1885480	1886040	Not well.
1886920	1890360	Maybe the next Dan Harmon, but the next Dan Harmon,
1890360	1893640	the person that's coming up behind you is making YouTube videos where they're also
1893640	1897560	shooting the whole thing and they're also sourcing the location and they're sourcing
1897560	1902840	their own kind of outfits and makeup and hair and they're doing the whole production
1902840	1904120	just to get a foot in the door.
1905320	1907080	Yeah, that's what Dan did, though.
1907080	1907640	Exactly.
1907640	1910760	But and I think we have more of an outlet, but like,
1911720	1913160	maybe it just seems like this way to us.
1913160	1914600	So you can correct me if...
1914600	1917240	And I will, as a European, I will bow to your better wisdom.
1917400	1923560	But for us, it seems like you guys, it was simple.
1923560	1929480	You kind of got your thing, like you did something that got a little bit of buzz,
1929480	1932440	and then maybe you got an agent or you got someone that was going to kind of help you
1932440	1933960	get in a couple more doors.
1933960	1937000	And then there was just the progression where you do one thing gets better.
1937000	1940680	For us, it feels like you get that one viral moment or you get that one successful thing
1940680	1942200	and it goes away for 10 years again.
1942200	1943400	Maybe that's not new.
1943640	1947480	I will pitch you something as an armchair biologist.
1950120	1955640	I look at it as like a reversal of how biology developed where
1957320	1961800	when you have capillary tissue arteries and things,
1961800	1965400	like you have channels that shoot you from point A to point B.
1965960	1967960	So then you have things like privilege like,
1967960	1970520	oh, you're born white and you're born in this neighborhood.
1970520	1972200	You're born into the in this class system.
1972840	1977640	It's easier for you to shoot up to these branching trees of like,
1977640	1979000	oh, you end up in the writer's room.
1979000	1983080	You're getting Gary Shandling sandwiches and you end up being a writer and things.
1983080	1988600	And then comparatively today, what you have is more of a sponge.
1989720	1995320	So it's almost like because the way that that stuff evolved was like you start with moss
1995320	1998600	and moss is like growing on a rock and it didn't have...
1999560	2000840	I've been lost. I'm so sorry.
2002040	2003400	Well, it's just like the idea that there's...
2003400	2006680	Probably a pay attention. It's about Gary Shandling sandwiches.
2006680	2008840	Right. Right. I have no idea.
2009320	2009800	Exactly.
2011720	2013400	That doesn't matter. That part doesn't matter.
2013400	2014680	Okay. No, I'm this thing. I'm this thing.
2014680	2017560	But I'm saying like, in terms of biology,
2017560	2024520	like if you fast forward from moss to trees to humans,
2024520	2029720	the key element is like this, the increasing sophistication of channels
2029720	2034920	by which you're like delivering nutrients from the earth to like these upper parts.
2034920	2035720	If you go back...
2035720	2037400	Only four more shows to go, you guys.
2039400	2043800	If you go backwards, you end up with just like this sponge shit on a rock.
2044600	2049560	And you're reliant on just getting splashed with water.
2049560	2051400	I think that's what millennials are.
2051960	2057160	And certainly Gen Zers and Gooby Goobers or whatever come before them.
2057160	2057640	That there's...
2058360	2059720	Fame is just fucking...
2061400	2063800	YouTube is just like, everyone's famous.
2063800	2065320	Fuck everyone.
2065320	2070360	And everyone's just like, subscribe and like, subscribe and like, subscribe and like.
2070360	2071640	And it's like, you can't...
2071640	2077400	You have no recourse to individuality. You have no recourse to being subversive.
2077400	2079320	Like, subversive. Are you kidding?
2079400	2081400	You'd be fucking checked in a second.
2081400	2082120	Are you kidding me?
2082120	2084040	Like, you fucking have a subversive opinion?
2084040	2084840	Fuck you, fucking fuck you.
2084840	2086840	Not even just subversive opinion.
2086840	2091800	But like, if you do anything that's not gonna get a wide audience, you're screwed.
2091800	2092280	Yeah.
2092280	2093000	Nothing's gonna pick up that way.
2093000	2093960	And they fucked us.
2093960	2099480	The corporations have succeeded in reverse evolutionizing the youth
2099480	2105000	so that they're in charge of the sea water and all the humanity is now moss.
2106200	2108680	No one's gonna grow up above the skyline.
2108680	2111880	No one's gonna fucking make their own biosphere.
2111880	2112920	But she gets it.
2112920	2113800	You don't!
2113800	2115640	I know, I get it. I get it.
2115640	2117400	I think what you're trying to say is...
2117400	2118520	Bad for glass.
2118520	2119240	It's waiting.
2119800	2122360	All of it's now kind of, it's not as connected anymore.
2122360	2124200	So it's all just happening randomly.
2124200	2126360	And you're waiting for that rainfall.
2126360	2130280	I warned kids about this at a million media conferences.
2130280	2133720	They go, they summoned me to these things they used to before I got me too.
2133720	2134920	They'd be like, Dean Herman, come.
2135400	2140760	You and Russell Simmons and Norman Lear and fucking Jay Leno come sit on this table in Miami
2140760	2145560	and fucking talk about the future of media with the CEO of Heinz Ketchup and Howie Mandel.
2145560	2149880	And I'd be like, okay, I'll do that.
2149880	2152520	And then there'd be this kid and I have a cooking show on YouTube.
2152520	2157080	And he'd be like, bro, why should I have to be at this table when the truth is on Vine?
2157080	2159480	I could have a million hits before I walk out of this room.
2159480	2164360	And I'd be like, bro, the reason is because your antenna is built out of this.
2164360	2167320	Is built out of ones and zeros by a fucking corporation.
2167320	2169560	And they're going to pull the rug out from under you.
2169560	2170760	And you're dependent.
2170760	2179400	Like right now, the biggest, the most democratic of the platforms is YouTube.
2179400	2183720	And it's awful because every five minutes something gets pulled.
2184440	2188200	They're converting everything to this labor intensive thing.
2188200	2191800	They don't want any individual to have power.
2192520	2198520	They reward popularity for the same reason that we did in high school,
2198520	2203080	which is that it's like this human impulse to go, actually the least remarkable,
2203080	2207880	the most average, you need the dough and like the most smooth,
2207880	2211880	fucking most caucasoid fucking average thing.
2211880	2214040	Like who's the least offensive?
2214040	2216280	Oh, wow, wow.
2216280	2220120	And let that rise to the top, but then let that fall because it's mediocre.
2220120	2221240	So it will fall.
2221240	2224200	Don't let anything shoot up and create a stalagmite.
2224200	2226600	Don't let anything actually affect the skyline.
2227880	2232280	I mean, I'm 23 and I'm finding myself having the same cynicism
2232280	2235800	as people that are much older than me because I'm just kind of going,
2235800	2237960	that sounds like the person that made that single last year,
2237960	2239880	but they're all different people, but they all kind of look the same.
2239880	2243480	And that's probably me just kind of being a bit of a judgmental artist,
2243480	2245720	but I do feel like it's becoming homogenous.
2245720	2248120	And you can, unless you play that game,
2248120	2250680	it's like you've got the people that really stand by you
2250680	2252360	and the rest is kind of just a soup.
2252360	2254040	I wish I had advice for kids your age.
2255480	2257160	I have this urge to say to kids your age,
2258200	2259640	but I don't think this is good advice,
2259640	2261480	but I have this urge to say to you guys,
2262360	2265880	put your money into infrastructure digitally.
2265880	2267640	Put your money into servers.
2267640	2270040	Put your money into creating your own antenna.
2270040	2273160	Don't rely on Google and these corporations
2273160	2274360	that present you with these platforms.
2274360	2275720	Why do you think that's good advice?
2275720	2277000	That's really good advice.
2277000	2280360	Because the truth is Mickey Mouse
2280360	2283160	was supposed to be public domain a couple of years ago,
2283160	2285560	and they'll change the rules on you quick as can be.
2286440	2288440	So I can't advise you to go like,
2288440	2291160	you should keep all your money in your mattress.
2291160	2294040	I can't tell you that because they will make mattresses.
2294040	2296600	Yeah, they will buy all the mattresses.
2296600	2297720	They'll say, that's federal.
2297720	2298680	That's imminent domain.
2298680	2299480	Like, what?
2299480	2300120	You sleep on that?
2302120	2302680	And then you'll be like,
2302680	2304520	Dan, you told me to put all my money in my mattress.
2304520	2305640	I'll be like, sorry.
2305640	2306680	No, I get it, exactly.
2306680	2307160	I get it.
2307160	2307640	I get it.
2307640	2312120	But what I want to say to you kids is defy these.
2312120	2314600	Don't let these corporations trick you
2314600	2316200	by virtue of their access.
2316200	2317800	They keep selling you kids.
2317800	2320600	They keep going like, hey, it's this app.
2320600	2321320	It's that app.
2321320	2323880	And you can do whatever you want.
2323880	2325080	You can say whatever you want.
2325080	2326680	But you notice the noose is tightening.
2328520	2330600	They always maintain control.
2330600	2332280	They own everything that you do.
2332920	2335240	I don't know what to tell you, though.
2336040	2340040	For you to invest your money in a fucking server,
2340040	2341160	there is no recourse.
2341160	2343000	Also, what if you have no money at all?
2343000	2343640	What if you're just?
2343640	2344360	Yeah, exactly.
2344360	2345880	Like, I would never tell you if you have $7.
2345880	2347640	Like, almost all of us have.
2347640	2349880	Yeah, like, you spend $3.
2349880	2351560	Yeah, Anya, can I give you some advice?
2351560	2352120	Sure.
2352120	2353480	Plan your estate right now.
2356920	2358440	It's never too early.
2358440	2359880	My home and town subscription.
2361560	2362200	Well, that'll be free it up pretty quick.
2362200	2364360	Have you ever gotten anything pulled down?
2364360	2364760	Sorry?
2364760	2366040	Have you ever, you said?
2366040	2367880	Luckily, well, God, yes.
2367880	2372440	What happened is, so to try and catch the algorithm,
2372440	2375000	I did covers of other people's songs.
2375000	2376920	They were fine because I didn't monetize them.
2376920	2379960	But YouTube said, you're spamming, which I wasn't.
2379960	2383640	It was just regular, like, normal posting.
2383640	2386360	And they took away my monetization on my original videos,
2386360	2387560	as well as all the rest of it.
2388200	2388600	Yeah.
2388600	2389080	How many?
2389080	2391080	But I don't make that much money from it anyway.
2391080	2392600	I'm, like, basically a bomb.
2392600	2395720	I don't make any money from my online stuff because.
2396760	2397240	Obama.
2402360	2403400	Thanks, Obama.
2405400	2407560	I mean, no, no, no, I'm kidding.
2407560	2411000	But can I just change tack really quickly?
2411000	2413320	Because it's been in my head, literally,
2413320	2414760	for the whole of this show.
2415960	2417880	The whole, not just this show, but the whole time
2417880	2419080	I've been listening to this show.
2419080	2420520	And this is going to sound really out of the blue,
2420520	2422440	and I may be the only person thinking this.
2422520	2425160	And I get to say this because I'm British and I'm black.
2425160	2425480	Shit.
2425480	2426120	Oh, my God.
2427800	2429720	Let me make one couple of predictions.
2429720	2430360	Cheers.
2431400	2431880	No, I don't know.
2433880	2434360	Blood.
2434920	2436760	It needs to be remarked to that.
2439240	2441000	And I may just be speaking for myself.
2441000	2442760	I think you're too harsh on yourself.
2442760	2443080	Oh.
2443080	2444440	When you're talking about all of these issues.
2444440	2445640	Holy shit, wait, British and black people
2445640	2446360	are telling me that?
2449880	2450040	No.
2450040	2451000	Holy fuck.
2451000	2453320	It took seven years, but we finally fucking figured it out.
2453320	2454200	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
2455160	2456520	No, no, I'll be specific.
2456520	2459640	That's like a vice grip of self-esteem,
2459640	2461560	like squeezing me right in the center.
2461560	2462760	I'll be specific.
2462760	2466200	It's on issues where you are like worried about
2466200	2470440	how moral you are or how like woke you are.
2470440	2472920	And I think sometimes you worry too much.
2472920	2476120	You are not on that side of the spectrum,
2476120	2480440	just because it's fancy to say that every white guy
2480440	2481800	is on that side of the spectrum.
2481800	2486840	Like you are surprisingly woke for your circumstances
2486840	2490040	and we need people like that on the team.
2490040	2491560	Hi, thank you.
2491560	2492920	We need you on the team.
2494120	2498040	Yeah, I'm not secretly thinking to myself as I go home.
2498040	2499640	God damn it, I'm Joe Rogan again.
2500680	2503880	Like I know that I'm left of everything productive.
2506760	2508520	I think it's only fair for me to say that
2508520	2510440	Dan paid Omnia to come here tonight.
2511560	2514440	I wish, I mean, I could use the money.
2514440	2514920	No, I'm kidding.
2516360	2517960	To give her money to buy her server.
2519880	2521080	Which I would not, I know how to use.
2521080	2523080	But the reason I say it is not because I think
2523080	2524600	that you think you're right of center,
2524600	2527240	but that I think, I mean, again,
2528040	2530200	if you listen to everything that Obama said this week,
2530200	2531720	it makes sense in context.
2531720	2534440	He was saying like it doesn't help to kick people
2534440	2535640	out the team that mean well.
2536200	2538520	And y'all mean well.
2538520	2540600	And so you're part of the team.
2540600	2542440	And yeah, every now and then we're gonna go,
2542440	2544120	okay, that wasn't great.
2544120	2547400	But it's better that than, oh, Nazi.
2547400	2550200	Like you don't have to do all of that sidelining
2550200	2550840	all of the time.
2550840	2553080	It can be a group effort and move forward together.
2553080	2555000	You don't perceive me as somebody who's like,
2555000	2557160	I think I've been pretty vocal about the fact
2557160	2560440	that we need to definitely forgive the ignorant.
2560440	2562520	Yeah, but I think that the,
2562920	2566760	I can't even remember what the specific context was,
2566760	2569240	but at the time, there was a situation
2569240	2571400	where you were kind of worried that,
2571400	2573480	or maybe I misinterpreted that you were worried
2573480	2576120	that all of these ignorant people
2576120	2578200	that are ignorant for the sake of being ignorant.
2578200	2580520	They're not ignorant because they actually wanna learn.
2581560	2583560	We forgive all of them.
2583560	2586680	There is a very small line and distinction.
2586680	2589320	And I think because maybe I'm online a bit more,
2589320	2592040	I see it more that there's a difference
2592120	2594760	between forgiving everybody that's ignorant
2594760	2598120	and forgiving those that are operating in good faith.
2598120	2600040	And so when you sympathize with the people
2600040	2601560	that aren't operating in good faith,
2601560	2603080	they're not on the team.
2603080	2604120	But again, I've taken this
2604120	2605320	in a completely political direction.
2605320	2606920	I didn't mean to like hide it.
2606920	2608200	But I wanna make sure, I mean,
2608200	2612440	you, I totally agree with you.
2612440	2614200	And like, do you think,
2614200	2618120	because I feel like that's the position that I'm in.
2618760	2622920	Or I'm like, gosh, I wish that we weren't so hard
2622920	2625800	on each other because by each other,
2626440	2628600	I include like people who are like,
2628600	2632520	they don't know if someone's like five years off a Twitter,
2632520	2635000	they don't know that they're supposed to say this
2635000	2635800	instead of that.
2635800	2636600	Right, right, right, right, right, right.
2636600	2638040	Like I can dog pile them.
2638040	2642440	Like I find myself saying the same thing
2642440	2644200	that a piece of shit might say.
2645400	2647320	However, for the better reason,
2647400	2650520	which is like, gosh, we can't tear each other apart.
2650520	2651080	Absolutely.
2651080	2652600	And so like, I don't know.
2652600	2654520	This is British black girl stamp of approval
2654520	2655160	on that opinion.
2655160	2656680	I, yeah.
2656680	2657960	Just in case you needed it,
2657960	2659000	but you probably didn't
2659000	2660200	because Brad also is on this list.
2660200	2663400	Well, maybe, here's some advice you could give me
2663400	2664920	as a British black girl, I think,
2664920	2670280	because like, I feel as British and black
2670280	2673080	as a white American can feel,
2673080	2675160	which is that I feel like,
2675560	2678280	we'll be right back.
2678280	2683560	This is blue, blue apron has a few words to say.
2683560	2687320	I really do hope we cut to me on these ad right there.
2687320	2692120	In that I just feel like I, I, I'm so,
2692120	2694120	and I, I cop to this where I'm like,
2694120	2699400	I, I am so unaccustomed to strife and confusion
2699400	2703240	that I just like, I'm, I, I've bailed.
2703240	2706040	And that, like, I think you could speak to
2706040	2707800	where you're like, you're British
2707800	2709480	and you're black and you're a woman.
2709480	2711560	Like, I think if you, you could probably
2712360	2713320	talk some sense into me.
2713320	2716280	Cause I'm like, this is fucking hard
2716280	2718040	when you're getting it from all sides.
2718040	2718600	Right.
2718600	2722280	Like, cause I feel like if I advocate for,
2722280	2724200	Hey, everybody should be allowed to say
2724200	2725880	whatever the fuck they want.
2725880	2728120	It's like, I just, I always feel caught
2728120	2729480	in the middle of everything.
2729480	2733880	I feel maybe I would listen to you on any of that.
2733880	2735560	Like, like if you were to, for instance,
2735560	2737640	tell me grow the fuck up, you're 46.
2737640	2739000	Like suck it up.
2739000	2741160	No, no, I mean, first of all,
2741160	2742760	anything that you're feeling is valid
2742760	2744200	because it's 2019.
2744200	2745960	Anything you're feeling is valid.
2745960	2747480	You're not invited to the conversation.
2747480	2750040	Yeah. Listen, but, but no, what I'm,
2750040	2751320	what I was going to say is like,
2753640	2756920	it's down to kind of, you have to start
2757000	2759560	from a place of, listen, life,
2760280	2762120	how, how are we even here?
2762120	2764120	And you go into the full philosophical thing of
2764120	2765960	we're on this planet and we're only here
2765960	2767080	for a certain amount of time.
2767640	2769560	So how are we going to make this as good
2769560	2770760	for everyone as we can?
2771320	2772440	How are we going to make this as pleasant
2772440	2773560	for everyone as we can?
2773560	2774440	And how are we going to be fair
2774440	2776920	to everyone historically and moving forward?
2776920	2779720	Once you think of everything in that macro sense,
2779720	2783160	this micro stuff contextualizes.
2783160	2785320	So if you're feeling it like it's happening
2785320	2786440	and it's coming from all sides,
2786440	2788600	it's like really, really intense.
2788600	2790040	Take a step back and think of like
2790040	2792280	the overall movement we're trying to make.
2792280	2795240	You're advocating for a thing that looks like
2795240	2797720	long ago in this podcast when I was going on tour.
2797720	2799400	I was like, we need a code.
2799400	2800440	We need an algorithm.
2800440	2802360	We need a simple algorithm
2802920	2805480	that we can fall back on in any situation of conflict.
2805480	2806600	And we go, wait, wait a minute.
2806600	2806920	All right.
2806920	2808440	I'm getting my tempers up.
2808440	2810920	My politics are getting in the way of micro stuff.
2810920	2814200	But like, let me fall back and go, for instance,
2814200	2816040	is there a human being hurt right now?
2816760	2817400	That kind of thing.
2817400	2818600	We need a code.
2818600	2819560	Like, for instance,
2819560	2821640	the reason I find the Green New Deal
2821640	2823720	to be the best set of policies
2823720	2826440	that have been put together for climate change
2826440	2827960	is that it takes into account
2827960	2831000	historical ways of taking care of the planet,
2831000	2832760	peoples that have been wronged.
2832760	2835880	All of that stuff needs to be part of the conversation
2835880	2837240	while we move forward.
2837240	2839000	Everything has to take in history.
2839000	2841240	Everything has to take in people that hurt now,
2841240	2842120	people hurt in the past,
2842120	2844680	people hurt maybe even by things in the future.
2844680	2846760	And I know it's a very happy-to-be way of doing things,
2846760	2848200	but I just feel like if you come
2848200	2851000	from a place of like love for one another
2851000	2855320	and also just kind of just acknowledging everybody.
2855320	2859560	And I think it's tough to do when people are refusing
2859560	2860600	to do the same thing.
2860600	2864840	It's tough to stay very kind of open heart
2864840	2866600	and stuff for people.
2866600	2869160	But as long as you're operating from that on a macro scale,
2869880	2873560	when the Nazis come out, you know that they are the Nazis.
2874920	2877000	And we move together, right?
2877000	2879400	And I mean, I'm not sure how helpful that is.
2879400	2880280	And you know who you are.
2882040	2883640	They were clapping, everybody clapping.
2884520	2885320	You're all Nazis.
2885320	2887720	You were clapping because you love your name being mentioned.
2888600	2889800	No, that's very helpful.
2889800	2891320	You said you don't know how helpful that is.
2891320	2892440	It's incredibly helpful.
2892440	2894600	Look, you don't know how lost I feel sometimes.
2894600	2898120	And I feel like I'm 46 and I don't suck my thumb about it anymore.
2898120	2899720	That's part of my struggle too, is like,
2899720	2900920	Dan, you're 46.
2900920	2902440	You're not allowed to suck your thumb.
2902520	2904840	It's like, I'm not allowed to be a baby anymore.
2904840	2906280	That's not inspiring.
2906280	2912200	Like Garrison Keeler, he has an obligation to be 85 years old
2912200	2915080	and go like, beep-bop, Aruba, Aruba, pie.
2915080	2919080	Like, I can't, like, I, this podcast was found for me.
2919080	2921000	Can you explain to me who Garrison Keeler is?
2922920	2925080	I don't know who Garrison Keeler is, y'all.
2925080	2925800	Ask your parents.
2927400	2929400	And hopefully one of your parents is American.
2929400	2929960	I don't know.
2930200	2933480	But it's an old guy that did a show for 1,000 years.
2934760	2937240	And it was funny in 1930.
2937240	2939400	And then he slowly turned 1,000.
2939400	2941480	And then he got me too to anyway.
2941480	2944120	And it was like, there is no guard against it.
2944120	2945080	Historical wrongs.
2946600	2949240	Like, there is no, I just don't want to be that guy.
2951080	2955400	I started this podcast from a standpoint of the joy of going,
2955400	2956600	I'm a baby.
2956600	2957800	I'm crying out.
2958360	2961000	And the world has shifted under my feet.
2961000	2964760	Like, it's not right, and it's not charismatic,
2964760	2968120	to be the baby that I was five years ago.
2968120	2970680	And that is a credit to the world that we live in.
2970680	2971880	An absolute credit.
2971880	2973640	Do you think then that that's part of the reason
2973640	2975800	why this is going away when you said I want you to stop?
2975800	2979960	Yes, because I don't think that it is appropriate to go,
2981480	2982520	it's hard to be me.
2982520	2986760	I don't find that, it doesn't matter whether it's right or wrong, objectively.
2986760	2987480	But that's valuable too.
2987480	2991320	I don't feel right doing it anymore.
2991320	2992680	I don't like it.
2992680	2997480	It doesn't come out of my throat with the same beautiful,
2998120	3002680	Hershey's syrupy sweetness that it did when I was 35.
3002680	3005720	Is there a purpose to the show aside from going wah, wah, wah?
3005720	3007560	Kind of, is this, there could be something to it.
3007560	3010200	I've tried going down that aisle in my mind,
3010200	3013000	where I'm like, let me signal boost this socialist
3013000	3014760	and this fucking charity and all these things.
3014760	3017160	And it's kind of like fumbled, there's a socialist over there.
3018280	3021320	I, you know.
3021320	3022360	Thank you for coming, Bernie.
3023880	3025640	I think there's a million versions.
3025640	3029320	I just, you know, I need to hit the bench and think about it.
3029320	3031640	Also, we thought the show, I never thought the show
3031640	3034200	is going to go longer than like a couple of weeks.
3035000	3036440	It's been amazing.
3036440	3040040	The fact that I just wouldn't die and went on for, how many years is now?
3040040	3040440	Seven years?
3040440	3041240	Seven.
3041240	3044600	But yeah, like it's, nothing has to last forever.
3044600	3051240	And it's like, whatever it becomes afterwards will be something else.
3051240	3052760	I think it's an amazing thing to say.
3052760	3054760	There's an issue I'm pitching called Omnia Town,
3054760	3056440	where Omnia is the host of the show.
3058120	3059240	The population of the podcast.
3059240	3061160	I mean, because we're all trying to do everything.
3061160	3063240	I also already have a podcast.
3063240	3065960	No one listens to it, but I have a podcast.
3065960	3066920	What is your podcast?
3066920	3067880	You want to plug it real quick?
3067880	3068360	Oh, sure.
3068360	3069480	It's called Nerd You.
3069480	3072520	I just review like movie stuff and TV stuff and...
3072520	3073080	Nerd You?
3073080	3073800	Yeah, Nerd You.
3073800	3075480	I just covered, I'm about to cover.
3075480	3079000	I went to a London film festival and watched a bunch of movies in advance.
3079000	3080200	Everyone go see Jojo Rabbit.
3080840	3083560	Everyone go see Jojo Rabbit right now.
3083560	3087720	Would it be too much of an onus on you to put...
3087720	3090920	Like Dan, you got your little musical thing over there and we got beats up there.
3090920	3095400	Can you do some of your music and maybe Dan like adds into it?
3095400	3100440	And then we'll put that shit on YouTube and we'll fucking boost that shit like crazy.
3101320	3102280	Okay, I mean...
3103000	3105640	Dan could rap and then you could do the break.
3107080	3109560	Also, and before that, do you want to shout out with your...
3109560	3110760	Do you have a YouTube channel that you want to...
3110760	3111240	I do.
3111240	3114200	It's just my name, U-M-N-I-A, Umnia.
3114200	3114920	Oh, it's Umnia.
3114920	3116760	I've been spelling it wrong on my notebook.
3116760	3117240	Umnia.
3117240	3118440	Umnia, U-M-N-I-A.
3118440	3119320	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3119320	3119800	Okay.
3121000	3122520	That's my mom.
3122520	3125000	Oh, your mom.
3125000	3125720	Hello, mom.
3128280	3130520	My mom, the only person in the world calling me.
3130520	3131560	Hey, mom, mom.
3131640	3132360	Come on.
3134360	3135240	Oh, shit.
3135240	3136520	They're going to do it, duet.
3137560	3139000	I can't believe this.
3139000	3140600	She's wearing a very dazzling outfit.
3140600	3142200	Am I even alive right now?
3142200	3142920	Oh, shit.
3143800	3145240	Am I even living right now?
3145240	3146440	This is lame.
3146440	3146920	Yeah.
3146920	3148120	Oh, my God.
3148120	3149160	What is happening?
3149960	3150440	Oh, my God.
3150440	3151320	This is what every 23-year-old wants.
3151320	3152920	Everybody needs a British mom.
3154040	3156600	That accent coming from the audience is like...
3156600	3157720	She shouted out clearly.
3157720	3159560	It was like one of your tracks.
3159560	3160120	She's like,
3160120	3161480	Do cold water at all?
3163480	3164280	I was like...
3165160	3167000	My American instinct was like,
3167000	3167800	Mom, shut up.
3167800	3168280	And I was like,
3168280	3170040	Goddamn, if my mom was James Bond.
3171720	3173000	I was like, fine with it.
3173400	3173960	Momnia?
3173960	3174520	What is your name?
3175080	3176040	Momnia.
3176040	3176520	Momnia.
3176520	3177880	My name's Sarah.
3177880	3178360	Sarah.
3179640	3180600	I don't think this is working.
3180600	3181400	But that's actually...
3181400	3181880	Yeah, it's not.
3181880	3182380	It's not.
3183640	3184840	Sharp doesn't need a voice.
3184840	3185880	My voice carries.
3188200	3189080	That one doesn't work.
3190440	3191160	It does now.
3191800	3192600	I'll take this one.
3193560	3194840	You said your name was Sarah.
3194840	3196040	My name is Sarah, but actually,
3196040	3197240	everybody calls me Momnia.
3197800	3199000	Oh, shit.
3199000	3200040	I mean, that's too easy.
3200040	3200600	Of course.
3200600	3203160	I'm going to go home and listen to this on Spotify,
3203160	3205080	and it's going to have me and my mom on it.
3206040	3207000	We're on Spotify?
3207000	3207960	I've been listening to this.
3210280	3210920	Holy shit.
3212840	3214680	That is so 2018.
3215800	3216920	It's British Spotify.
3216920	3219400	It's Sputify with a U.
3221080	3223800	Yeah, it just got poppin' in the UK, so...
3223800	3226040	Did you guys get to Sputify with a U.S.?
3226040	3226520	To get it.
3226520	3227080	Someone did.
3228280	3230040	Anyway, yeah, people call her Momnia.
3230040	3230760	That's crazy.
3230760	3231720	Sarah, how do you feel about...
3232600	3234680	Well, first of all, what's your...
3235240	3238600	Fill us in on what your life is, and you still live in Cambridge?
3239320	3240600	We live in Cambridge.
3240600	3244120	I am the amazingly gifted mom.
3244120	3245160	Yeah, keep the mic close, yeah.
3245160	3245560	Sorry.
3245560	3247320	You can tell I don't do this for a living.
3248360	3249480	Not from the jacket.
3251080	3254600	I'm pretty sure it feels like you just came from three different shows.
3254600	3255560	Read her!
3256440	3257320	Read her!
3257320	3258760	How can you tell, Dan?
3258760	3261000	You are fantastic.
3261800	3264840	But no, I'm blessed with two amazing girls.
3264840	3266120	Umnia's my eldest.
3267240	3272120	She's our musician and actress, and she's insanely talented.
3272120	3275880	The song that I shouted out, well, she has a few that are amazing,
3275880	3278840	but that particular one is really good, so...
3278840	3280680	Are you a musician too, Sarah, or no?
3280680	3281400	No, I sing...
3283400	3284120	Does that mean she is?
3284120	3287560	She is the most amazing jazz singer.
3287560	3288440	Oh, my God.
3289720	3291640	And it's where I get it from.
3291640	3293560	But that's not what I do for a living.
3293560	3295640	But you have that gift in you.
3296520	3297320	Yes.
3297320	3298360	This is complicated.
3298360	3298840	Thank you.
3300360	3301720	I'd love to say it's a gift.
3301720	3305400	I would just say it's a thing, and it's always been a thing.
3305400	3306840	So it's like Marvel movie shit.
3306840	3307800	I've never pursued that.
3309800	3310920	You've never been show busy.
3312360	3313080	I've done gigs.
3313080	3315160	I've worked with bands, but it's not my day job.
3315160	3315880	Oh.
3315880	3318360	My day job is saving kids' lives.
3318360	3319080	Just a little.
3319080	3319640	Just a little.
3319640	3321160	God, you feel so much alike.
3321160	3321720	Crazy shit.
3321720	3323880	Like, you're like, oh, it's not for me.
3323880	3326680	I raise a daughter, and it's buried under concrete.
3326680	3330440	It's like a microphone and a stand-up bass,
3330440	3332680	and she has to chisel it open, and it's like...
3333320	3336280	Well, no, but it's because there is no time,
3336280	3339000	because my daytime job is a doctor.
3339560	3340280	Oh, shit.
3340280	3341480	So there is no time.
3341480	3342600	You're a superhero.
3343240	3343800	Yes.
3343800	3346120	You're like, I could have been a jazz musician,
3346120	3347480	but I had to be a doctor in a space jacket.
3347480	3349240	Not just any old doctor.
3349240	3351080	She's a pediatrician.
3351080	3352520	She takes care of kids.
3352520	3353000	Oh, my God.
3353000	3354600	That's right.
3354600	3358680	Now, O'Neill, is your musical...
3360040	3361480	Is that a chip off her block?
3361480	3361560	Yes.
3361560	3362360	Oh, God, yes.
3362360	3362760	Yes.
3362760	3365480	I mean, you grow up with someone that loves music,
3365480	3366440	and you're gonna...
3366440	3366920	Yeah.
3366920	3367240	Yeah.
3367240	3369960	What was the music that you played, Sarah?
3369960	3372040	What was the music that O'Neill grew up around?
3372040	3373080	Like, what did you play?
3373080	3374840	She grew up with Prince, number one.
3374840	3375560	Fuck, yeah.
3375560	3376280	Yeah.
3376280	3376760	Yeah.
3376760	3377560	Love to see it.
3377560	3380360	So Prince, when they were little, I mean, like, really little.
3380360	3381960	When we were little, can you imagine?
3381960	3383560	Yeah, even when they needed to, like,
3383560	3385880	nobody was going to go to sleep, and everybody was sick,
3385880	3388760	would be in the car, and they would be sick.
3388760	3391240	Tiny little babies in their sort of seats,
3391320	3393960	and we'd be blaring Prince up and down the highway.
3393960	3395240	Even the dirty stuff?
3395240	3395720	Yeah.
3397080	3399080	His lyrics are pretty frisky.
3399080	3399880	Darling, Nicky.
3402680	3404600	That early frisky stuff, you don't understand
3404600	3405560	when you're four months old.
3405560	3406120	It's true.
3406120	3406840	Right?
3406840	3407880	So it was okay.
3407880	3409960	So windows would be down, sunroofed down,
3409960	3413800	and we'd just fly on sort of the little country roads
3413800	3416520	in Cambridge, trying to get a baby to sleep with Prince on it.
3416520	3418600	It worked, and it worked.
3418600	3419720	And it wasn't easy.
3419720	3420680	What's your vocal range?
3421240	3423560	Who do you, where would your vocal quality fall?
3423560	3426360	Like, who's a singer that we know?
3426360	3427160	Dinah Washington.
3427160	3427800	Oh, I'm a Dinah Washington.
3427800	3428520	Dinah Washington.
3428520	3430200	No way, because she's the greatest.
3430200	3431000	Well, thank you.
3431000	3431400	Thank you.
3431400	3433000	But I'm not, but I try.
3434200	3436040	Just, like, what's a good Dinah Washington song?
3437320	3438280	Oh, I just, I just-
3438280	3439080	What a difference, David.
3439080	3442200	It's always late, any time we have a date,
3442200	3443240	but I love him.
3444200	3446200	Yes, it's always you and my baby.
3446200	3448920	That's Louis Jordan, but Dinah does a good job of that.
3448920	3450760	Yeah, well, that's the song I grew up on,
3450760	3452200	and she used to sing at her gigs.
3452200	3452680	Okay.
3452680	3453240	And relax, Max.
3453240	3453880	Yes, you is.
3453880	3454920	Yes, you is.
3454920	3455720	My baby.
3456760	3457000	Go.
3458760	3460440	Go, no, keep going.
3461720	3465640	The way you acted lately makes me die.
3465640	3466760	Oh, you are good.
3466760	3469400	You is still my baby.
3469400	3470360	Sing with me.
3471720	3473560	No, listen, my memory's rotting.
3473560	3474200	You keep going.
3474200	3475240	My baby, baby.
3475240	3476600	Baby, keep going.
3476600	3480120	Seems my fame in your heart don't go down.
3481160	3486200	A man is a creature that has always been strange.
3486200	3490600	Just when you're short of one, you'll find he's gone and made a change.
3490600	3491480	Woo!
3491480	3492280	Hey.
3492280	3494280	No, you still here.
3494280	3495880	No, you still wait.
3495880	3497400	My baby.
3497400	3498680	Okay, I'm really done now.
3498680	3499720	Because I'm shaking, too.
3499720	3500920	Oh, shit.
3500920	3507880	They don't want them babies coming round the bend.
3507880	3508760	Get it.
3508760	3513400	Everybody wants them babies coming round the bend.
3514440	3519320	Don't want them babies coming out of me.
3520840	3524760	Everybody's babies are gonna be free.
3525800	3527240	Only three shows left, everybody.
3527240	3528120	Only three shows.
3529080	3531240	I'm gonna miss this show so much.
3531240	3531720	I'm sorry.
3531720	3532920	No, I was just gonna say I'm gonna miss it.
3532920	3534520	No, I'm not gonna miss it.
3534520	3535640	I'm so confused.
3535640	3538200	You said you were having confidence problems this year,
3538200	3542600	and you do not strike me as an unconfident person at all.
3542600	3544440	Something about this show feels like home.
3544440	3547080	I've been having a really rough year.
3547080	3551960	But you know, just like both of you, also, you're identical.
3551960	3555320	From where I'm sitting, you're so beautifully the same mother and daughter is beautiful.
3555320	3555800	Thank you.
3556600	3559480	Also, I feel like there's certain people that are born with microphones in their hand.
3559480	3563160	And I think that you're probably more confident if you have a vehicle.
3563160	3566200	No, you, and Sarah, for sure.
3566200	3566680	And me.
3571080	3574760	And I grew older and replaced the mic with a drink.
3574760	3575160	I was talking.
3576840	3577160	All right.
3577160	3578360	It's not about me.
3578360	3579000	It's not about me.
3580440	3584280	But the fact that holding a microphone, when you have a voice like that,
3584280	3586120	it must be fun just to let that out.
3586120	3587560	That's why showers were built.
3587560	3590120	So you can sing in that, and the acoustics are-
3590120	3590760	And the other thing.
3592600	3593720	Yeah, I mean, yeah.
3595160	3595640	Yeah.
3595640	3596680	I don't even use the water.
3596680	3597400	I just sing, and I'm-
3598280	3599080	Just get in there.
3599080	3599880	The acoustics.
3601320	3602360	Do you often sing together?
3603400	3604280	Around the house, or no?
3604280	3605800	We, I mean, around the house, yes.
3605800	3606520	Yes, we do.
3607480	3609480	Because we're all quite close as a family,
3609480	3611960	so we tend to finish off each other's sentences.
3611960	3612840	And we do that-
3612840	3612920	Sentences.
3612920	3614200	And we'll do that with songs.
3614200	3614680	Yeah.
3616680	3617160	And we'll-
3619560	3620600	That was a good part, though.
3622440	3624040	And we'll do that with songs.
3624040	3626680	So somebody will walk into the room singing a phrase,
3626680	3629240	and we'll just pick it up and harmonize.
3629240	3632120	What's your favorite print song?
3632760	3633320	Oh, gosh.
3633320	3637400	Like, if you walk around the house and you wanted to just pipe up on a print song.
3637400	3640040	Well, it depends whether I want to sing it or whether I want to hear it.
3640040	3640520	Party Man?
3640520	3642440	Thunder is one of my favorites.
3642440	3643880	I love Diamonds and Pearls.
3644840	3645720	You know, they're-
3645720	3649160	If I gave you diamonds and pearls.
3649160	3649560	Yeah.
3649560	3650280	No, no, no, no.
3652040	3654280	I'm trying to make this show great by you singing.
3655080	3657240	Well, shall I- shall I sing Summertime for you, then?
3657240	3658040	Yeah!
3658040	3658440	Hell yeah.
3660280	3662920	Oh, this holiday has been the best one.
3662920	3663880	I'm sorry, Sarah.
3663880	3665000	We're just out of time.
3667000	3667480	Bye.
3668200	3669320	No, please, please do.
3669720	3670200	Okay.
3670200	3670680	Billie.
3671640	3672520	Allahu.
3672520	3673160	Which version?
3674200	3674920	Gosh, I don't know.
3675720	3676440	Pearl Bailey, maybe?
3676440	3677160	You'll pick, you'll pick.
3677960	3680680	I'd say maybe, I don't know, maybe Billie.
3680680	3681640	Oh, Billie, Billie.
3681640	3683320	But I'm not that- no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3683320	3684280	No expectations.
3684280	3685640	No, but you're doing it, Allahu.
3685640	3687640	Yeah, keep- yes, keep your expectations low.
3687640	3687880	No.
3688600	3689240	Lay it on a second.
3689240	3690200	It's a travel visa.
3692360	3693640	And I don't want to get chucked out.
3693640	3694200	Yeah.
3694200	3695480	Yes, that's what I want to say.
3696200	3696680	Okay.
3697640	3700040	Summertime
3703320	3707720	and the living is easy.
3709480	3711160	Them fish is jumping
3713080	3715720	and the cotton is high.
3718600	3720920	Your daddy, he's rich.
3721640	3722280	No, he wasn't.
3723240	3727320	And your mama's good looking.
3727320	3728200	Yes, she is.
3728200	3729240	She sure is.
3729240	3730120	She sure is.
3731400	3739720	So hush, little baby, don't you cry.
3741960	3748200	One of these mornings, you're gonna wake up smiling.
3748200	3749000	Smiling.
3749000	3753080	And you're gonna spread your wings.
3753080	3754200	On two, not white people.
3755560	3758680	And you're gonna fade to the sky.
3761000	3761480	Thank you.
3763000	3765000	But till that morning.
3768840	3769640	I missed something.
3769640	3771080	I'm so sorry for my audience.
3771080	3771560	I'm sorry.
3771560	3772280	What happened?
3774360	3776200	Yeah, the white people are tapping on one and three
3776200	3777160	and that affects the whole thing.
3779000	3782040	One of these morning.
3783080	3786520	You're gonna wake up smiling.
3787480	3788520	I'll try and guide you.
3789800	3791480	And you spread your wings.
3794120	3796840	And you'll take to the sky.
3800040	3801960	But till that morning.
3804680	3806440	There ain't nothing can harm you.
3807320	3807820	That one.
3809320	3817960	Mommy and daddy standing by.
3819960	3820460	Yeah.
3825800	3828520	Summertime.
3828520	3830840	You have no idea how happy that makes me.
3830840	3832920	You have no idea how happy this makes me.
3832920	3836200	I haven't sang with mom jazz for so long.
3836280	3838040	How happy does it make you?
3842120	3846920	This mom, I don't have this kind of relationship with,
3846920	3850760	I don't get this as mom, do you think you kind of bury your,
3851320	3853560	I mean, what are you, are you a PhD?
3854840	3855560	I'm an MD.
3857160	3858440	Is that better than a PhD?
3859320	3861800	She has a PhD which allowed her to be an MD.
3862440	3864600	Yeah, a PhD means you aren't a doctor, right?
3864600	3866360	And an MD means you are a doctor.
3866360	3869720	Yes, PhD is like an ornamental book.
3869720	3871160	So, so, so.
3871160	3871800	No, it's no, no, no.
3871800	3872680	It's no shade.
3872680	3874200	I just, so you can.
3874200	3875160	Fuck you PhD.
3876120	3876840	No shade.
3876840	3877720	There's no shade.
3878440	3879480	Sarah said it first.
3880440	3881560	It's doctorate.
3881560	3883720	It's just, it's the terminology.
3883720	3887240	So, so, so when you become an MD, you become a doctor,
3887240	3889080	which is like a clinician doctor.
3889080	3891640	And then if you want to do some extra research,
3891640	3893800	whether you are already an MD
3893800	3897240	or whether you're anyone else who does sort of extra super research,
3897240	3899240	then you become a PhD doctor doctor.
3899240	3902360	So if you do a PhD and an MD, then you're a double doctor.
3903080	3905960	But in any case, is singing like a thing that you,
3907080	3910360	what's the relationship between you and your daughter and singing?
3910360	3911480	And how does that train?
3911480	3913560	Are you known as the singing doctor?
3915320	3916680	Oh, wouldn't that be great?
3916680	3917560	No, no.
3917560	3919880	Are you sort of like, like, let me speculate.
3919880	3921080	Her patients call her Mary Poppins though.
3921080	3923480	She has a big doctor bag and she had this hat
3923560	3924520	that used to collapse.
3924520	3926360	So she was like proper Mary Poppins.
3926360	3930200	Are you as a mom, maybe, are you like a person
3930200	3933000	that went through a lot of hardship and you're like,
3933000	3937000	man, if singing was a thing that could support a family,
3937000	3939000	then God damn it, I'd do it.
3939000	3942440	But actually, I think I'll use, I'll use my brain
3942440	3944200	and I got to raise my daughter up.
3944200	3946360	And then your daughter has a proclivity for that.
3946360	3948280	And you're like, go girl, go.
3949160	3951880	And, but she's looking at you and going,
3951960	3953640	why didn't you go girl, go?
3953640	3956920	And you're like, I couldn't go girl, go.
3959160	3959800	Do you know?
3959800	3964840	Well, in a way, you kind of read me, but, but,
3964840	3966120	but not a hundred percent.
3966120	3969960	So, so my family, my father was also a doctor,
3971080	3972680	but very traditional.
3972680	3976280	So this idea of doing anything but medicine was like,
3976280	3976920	oh no.
3977720	3981320	And so even though my mother was musical and I was musical,
3981320	3983640	there was no way that was going to happen.
3983640	3985720	Well, it did because, you know, when you're a teenager,
3985720	3986840	you don't listen to anybody.
3986840	3988520	And so, so it did.
3988520	3990520	And it even did after I graduated,
3990520	3993560	but they weren't ever part of that part of me.
3993560	3997800	And so when this little one at the age of three months
3997800	4000920	was literally mimicking my singing,
4000920	4004120	so I'd be vacuuming around her court and she'd be singing.
4005320	4009160	She'd be singing what I should be humming what I was singing.
4009160	4011480	And my husband would say, you're just an indulgent mom.
4011480	4013240	And I'd go, no, the child is singing.
4013240	4014200	All right.
4014200	4018040	And so that happened from the age of kind of three months onwards.
4018040	4021400	And so when she said that was what I want to do, I said,
4021400	4022440	you go girl.
4022440	4023080	All right.
4023080	4023560	Yeah.
4023560	4027080	Sarah, oh, yeah, sorry.
4027080	4027640	Yeah.
4027640	4028600	I'm a lucky kid.
4028600	4029480	I'm a lucky kid.
4029480	4031160	Not everyone I know knows how to do that.
4031160	4034440	How old was Zimnia when you guys could harmonize together?
4034440	4035960	Like, was that something that she had to learn?
4035960	4036520	Or is that something?
4036520	4037080	No.
4037080	4040040	She had that was just an innate skill.
4040040	4043000	And it just turned out one day, literally turned out one day.
4043000	4043880	So I'd be singing.
4043880	4049800	And suddenly I heard this incredible harmonic sort of response.
4049800	4051400	And she's been like that ever since.
4051400	4053960	And I think I developed it later.
4053960	4057720	So as I sang jazz, it was when I sort of hit my mid-40s
4057720	4060600	that I could riff or I could improvise.
4061240	4065320	This child has been doing it since she was pretty much vocal.
4065400	4067400	But really harmonizing, no big deal.
4069880	4071160	Jeff, like, give me a note.
4071160	4072120	I'll harmonize with it.
4074120	4074920	Who?
4074920	4075420	Hi.
4078120	4079960	That's scale somewhere.
4079960	4081480	That's sometimes scale.
4081480	4082840	Some scale has that in it.
4082840	4085320	I'm going to look at it.
4085320	4085960	I'll walk up.
4085960	4087720	We're going to graduate a little bit.
4087720	4090280	Dan, I'm going to go.
4090680	4092680	All right.
4092680	4098680	And this is the end.
4098680	4102360	He's got it.
4102360	4104200	I mean, it's really no big deal.
4104200	4106840	I don't mean to take anything away from your relationship.
4106840	4110040	But honestly, harmony.
4110040	4112280	If Harmontown doesn't serve us at all,
4112280	4114600	it's to demystify innate talent.
4117560	4119960	I've never understood harmony for real, though.
4119960	4123400	I've never gotten that, like the idea of harmonizing.
4123400	4124200	I don't get that.
4124200	4126360	Well, there's all these notes.
4126360	4128040	And then there's notes that fit together nicely.
4128040	4130120	And by all of these, you mean eight.
4130120	4130680	There's eight.
4131720	4134360	No, there's like 13 maybe in our day-to-day.
4134360	4135400	If there's 12, 12.
4135400	4136600	It's 12 on a 12.
4136600	4137720	All right, there's 13.
4137720	4138520	Oh, it's octaves.
4138520	4142120	Right, so like if you want like a one, three, five.
4142120	4142920	Like a one.
4142920	4143420	Yeah.
4144280	4147160	Three, five, one, two, three.
4147160	4147960	You haven't got there.
4150200	4151480	All right, all right.
4151480	4153800	Sarah and Umia, I'll do a note.
4155480	4156440	Sarah, add a note.
4156440	4157240	Umia, add a note.
4157240	4160680	And then Dan, I want you to lay a sexy jazzy note on top of it.
4160680	4161080	Me?
4161080	4161480	Me?
4161480	4161880	Yeah.
4161880	4162280	Me?
4162280	4163160	Yes.
4163160	4164120	I'd be honored.
4164120	4166120	Mm.
4166120	4168120	Mm.
4168120	4170120	Mm.
4170120	4172120	Mm.
4172120	4174120	Mm.
4174120	4176120	Mm.
4176120	4178120	Mm.
4178120	4180120	Mm.
4180120	4180840	You'd love to sing it.
4180840	4182920	All right, well that I'll give you.
4184200	4187880	That made it seem like not a thing.
4187880	4189560	Now, Dan, you start.
4189560	4191240	All right, let me start.
4191240	4193240	Yeah, but you, but hold on.
4193240	4195240	Mm.
4195240	4197240	Mm.
4197240	4199240	Yeah.
4199240	4201240	See, I did it.
4201240	4206280	Okay, now, start from Spencer and go all the way through the whole stage here.
4206280	4208280	From stage right to stage left.
4208280	4210280	Uh.
4210280	4212280	Uh.
4212280	4214280	Uh.
4214280	4216280	Uh.
4216280	4218280	Uh.
4218280	4220280	Uh.
4220280	4222280	Sorry, uh.
4222280	4224280	Uh.
4224280	4226280	Okay.
4226280	4228280	I'm sorry.
4228280	4230280	Uh.
4230280	4233280	I'm sorry, I can do it for real though.
4233280	4235280	Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.
4235280	4238280	Just a nice, nice and easy, just a nice soft, single tone.
4238280	4240280	All right, you start it.
4240280	4242280	Is there any guidance that when he lays it down?
4242280	4244280	You gotta harmonize.
4244280	4246280	All right.
4246280	4248280	It's in your name.
4248280	4249280	Our next show is called Harmonized town.
4249280	4251380	He's home and tired, exactly.
4251380	4252320	I'm gonna do it for real.
4252320	4253160	Sorry.
4253160	4253980	All right.
4253980	4254820	Just sustain.
4254820	4255660	Just sustain.
4255660	4256500	All right.
4256500	4257340	Oh.
4257340	4258160	Oh.
4258160	4259500	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
4259500	4260360	Straight over, straight over.
4260360	4262140	That actually would have been kind of a jazzy note.
4262140	4263540	Because I don't wanna fuck up these guys.
4263540	4265860	Dan, Dan, he could sing his name.
4265860	4267700	Then it'll be easier to hold the note.
4267700	4268540	Yeah.
4268540	4269360	Who, me?
4269360	4270200	What do you mean?
4270200	4271040	Hi.
4271040	4273420	If you sing your name, it's easier to hold the note.
4273420	4274260	Spencer.
4277260	4278100	Dan.
4279280	4280960	In the end.
4280960	4282320	Sarah.
4282320	4283160	John.
4286160	4288160	And what about Dan?
4288160	4289000	Bob Weaver!
4292500	4293340	Whoo!
4295000	4295840	Oh shit.
4297840	4299400	Why does saying your name help?
4299400	4300240	It doesn't help.
4300240	4301920	Cause you focus on, I think, what you're saying.
4301920	4302940	On who you are.
4302940	4303780	To Dan.
4303780	4304600	Yeah.
4304600	4305420	That's it.
4305420	4306260	Wow.
4306260	4307100	That's it.
4307100	4308160	And it's not some kind of nebulous thing.
4308160	4309360	It's like, oh, I know that.
4309360	4310440	Yeah, I know myself.
4310440	4311160	Yep.
4311160	4312000	Oh, my god.
4312000	4312720	And you hold on there.
4312720	4314280	That's like people that say they can't sing.
4314280	4315160	I'm a firm believer.
4315160	4319000	And a friend of mine, Michael Pollack, taught me.
4319000	4321160	I grew up musically, and I can't always sing.
4321160	4324560	I grew up in a very musical family, kind of.
4324560	4326000	He said everybody can sing, but people
4326000	4327800	have been talked out of singing at a young age.
4327800	4328200	Yes.
4328200	4329560	And people that say, I can't sing,
4329560	4333000	some asshole relative told you at a birthday party
4333000	4333960	that you should not sing.
4333960	4335160	Correct.
4335160	4336600	Or your auntie, or your grandma.
4336600	4337280	Right, exactly.
4337280	4338760	It's called sing shaming.
4338760	4339240	Yeah.
4339240	4340040	Whoa.
4340040	4342280	But everybody can sing happy birthday.
4342280	4343240	Everybody can whistle.
4343240	4343760	Yes.
4343760	4346880	Or maybe you have some thing with your mouth that you can't.
4346880	4349680	But people can go like, happy birthday.
4349680	4351400	Everybody can do it.
4351400	4353600	And you've been talked out of singing,
4353600	4357960	and talked out of the fact that we can all share a tune.
4357960	4360840	And I think that's so cool to grow up in a family.
4360840	4362280	My mother thought she couldn't sing.
4362280	4365560	My dad was just too stoic and didn't really sing.
4365560	4367840	But they put me in the theater and stuff like that.
4367840	4370440	So I was always around musical people.
4370440	4371940	But when they would leave the house,
4371940	4375880	I would put on Duke Ellington records, and Sinatra,
4375880	4378720	and Gershwin, and Nat King Cole.
4378720	4381160	And I thought it would be important one day
4381160	4383800	to know all that stuff.
4383800	4384720	You know why, Jeff?
4384720	4388880	Because it's important to Spencer and Dan.
4388880	4389380	Uh-oh.
4389380	4389880	Dan.
4389880	4390380	Dan.
4390380	4390880	Dan.
4390880	4391380	Dan.
4391380	4391880	Dan.
4392120	4392620	Hey.
4392620	4395120	Sorry.
4395120	4396400	It's important to Spencer.
4396400	4401400	You guys, we open in three nights.
4401400	4402640	Hey.
4402640	4403360	Hey.
4403360	4403880	Hey.
4403880	4408280	I hate to interrupt right now, but I'm interrupting.
4408280	4410280	It's the funniest thing in the world,
4410280	4415320	is Spencer with the microphone coming down.
4415320	4416560	45 degrees.
4416560	4417060	Spencer.
4417060	4419980	Spencer.
4419980	4422420	That's not a note.
4422420	4423060	It's a note.
4423060	4423820	It's a note.
4423820	4424460	It is a note.
4424460	4425260	I don't mean it.
4425260	4425760	OK.
4425760	4428820	Spencer might be the, like, Spencer.
4428820	4429580	It's funny.
4429580	4430540	That's not an easy one.
4430540	4432620	You want a one syllable open vowel sound.
4432620	4434340	Spencer's a little difficult.
4434340	4437540	My mom said everyone could sing or dance,
4437540	4438860	but no one could do both.
4447580	4448700	And I think that's true.
4448700	4451220	I think that bears out.
4451220	4453060	I take that from the stare.
4458260	4459940	Could she do either, Spencer?
4459940	4460820	Yeah, yeah.
4460820	4461380	Which one?
4461380	4462260	She could sing.
4462260	4463380	OK, but not dance.
4463380	4465100	No, no, no.
4465100	4466660	She took the world out with her.
4466660	4468340	She did learn how to dance.
4468340	4468840	Yeah.
4468840	4469700	What kind of dance?
4469700	4470700	Like ballroom and stuff?
4470700	4472140	Yeah, ballroom.
4472140	4472660	Swingser.
4472660	4474660	Swingser.
4474660	4475460	What?
4475460	4476580	Let's all do Spencer.
4476580	4477860	Let's all harmonize.
4477860	4479260	Wait, how about this?
4479260	4480180	Let's all Spencer.
4480180	4480820	OK, how about this?
4480820	4481340	Let's do this.
4481340	4482220	Here's an experiment.
4482220	4484900	This might be a total disaster.
4484900	4488060	I want Umnia and Sarah to start.
4488060	4489820	Umnia, you go.
4489820	4491340	Sarah, you go.
4491340	4494180	And then the audience finds it as one.
4494180	4496060	Dan and Spencer and I, we lay off this one.
4496060	4496540	OK.
4496540	4497940	So it's going to go Umnia, Sarah.
4497940	4500820	So should I say my name, or should I just pick a note?
4500820	4501540	Let's Spencer.
4501540	4502540	Umnia.
4503540	4504040	Sarah.
4504040	4504540	No, no, no.
4504540	4505540	It's the whole of us.
4505540	4506100	Sorry, sorry.
4506100	4506940	I fucked it up.
4506940	4508020	Umnia.
4508020	4508500	Spencer.
4512220	4513460	It's my favorite.
4513460	4514300	It's the moon.
4514300	4514800	Cut.
4514800	4516300	Cut.
4516300	4516800	OK.
4516800	4517300	Sarah.
4517300	4518060	It's Sarah.
4518060	4519620	Everyone just say their own names.
4519620	4520740	Sarah, you're going to say Sarah,
4520740	4521820	and then they're all going to say Sarah.
4521820	4523220	Oh, everyone's saying Sarah.
4523220	4524220	I'm not saying Sarah.
4524220	4524720	Sarah.
4524720	4525940	Sarah, and then y'all.
4525940	4527940	I'm saying Sarah.
4527940	4529420	Sarah.
4529420	4529920	Sarah.
4533540	4535020	And what about Sean?
4541020	4543700	I like that Spencer added a sexy sixth on top of that.
4543700	4544700	Oh, yeah.
4544700	4547620	That's the beauty is almost every 95% of you
4547620	4549700	all sing the fifth note on that.
4549700	4550700	That's just logical.
4550700	4551220	Yes.
4551220	4552140	I think it's human.
4552140	4553220	And they can all sing.
4553220	4555820	Yeah, I think it's part of, I think
4555820	4557940	we all can move to a beat, no matter
4557940	4559780	how malindeficient we may be.
4559780	4561860	I think we can all sing to it.
4561860	4562860	Give us a beat.
4562860	4563360	Let's go.
4563360	4563860	Boom.
4563860	4564620	Zach, everybody.
4564620	4565700	Lay a beat on us.
4565700	4566260	Zach, everybody.
4566260	4567620	Let's see if we can put this to music.
4567620	4569620	Mm.
4569620	4571120	Yo.
4571120	4571620	You go.
4571620	4572120	You go.
4572120	4572620	You go.
4572620	4573120	You go.
4573120	4573620	You go.
4573620	4574120	Yeah.
4574120	4574620	Spencer.
4574620	4575620	Yeah.
4575620	4576120	Yo.
4576120	4578120	Yeah.
4578120	4579620	Yo.
4579620	4580120	Yo.
4580120	4581620	Yo.
4581620	4583120	Yo.
4583120	4584100	Yo.
4584100	4585100	Spencer.
4585100	4585600	Yo.
4585600	4586100	Spencer.
4586100	4587100	Yo.
4587100	4588100	Spencer.
4588100	4588740	Yeah.
4588740	4591620	My name is Mr. Raph, and I'm here to say
4591620	4595940	I'd like to rap all day and also all day.
4595940	4601580	When I rap all day, I like to rap all day and then stay.
4601580	4605300	I'd like to rap till the beat expires.
4605300	4609540	Then I'll defeat the rap itself, and then I'll
4609540	4611740	put the rap up on a shelf.
4611740	4618140	It's predictable rhymes, but these are predictable times.
4618140	4620620	These times are predictable.
4620620	4622820	I'm like, well, fuck your mama, because her pussy's
4622820	4623300	delectable.
4623300	4624300	Woo-hoo.
4624300	4624800	Yeah.
4624800	4625300	Yo.
4625300	4625980	I want to eat it.
4625980	4626480	Uh-huh.
4626480	4626980	Yo.
4626980	4630280	I'll put it in a bowl to feed it, and I take a spoon,
4630280	4632420	and scoop it in my mouth, going to do it
4632420	4634580	in the north, and the east, and the south.
4634580	4635580	Say what?
4635580	4637420	Eat your mama's pussy with my lips.
4637420	4638140	Oh, no.
4638140	4638780	Yo.
4638780	4640300	I put it on 100 ships.
4640300	4643820	Take it from Europe to the US.
4643820	4645980	Put it up to my mama's breast.
4645980	4647460	Oh, no.
4647460	4648860	Rub it on my mama's titties.
4648860	4649360	Oh, no.
4649360	4650180	Yo.
4650180	4651660	Rub it on the 100 cities.
4651660	4652460	Stop that.
4652460	4655300	New York to London town.
4655300	4658100	Everybody's going to fucking Pennywise clown.
4658100	4661020	They all float down here, motherfucker.
4661020	4663380	Oh, my name is Zucker.
4663380	4664860	Spencer.
4664860	4665340	Spencer.
4668100	4670420	My name is Spencer.
4670420	4671900	Spencer.
4671900	4673860	Spencer.
4673860	4675340	My name is Spencer.
4677620	4678100	Spencer.
4680900	4683100	Let me tell you a little story about me.
4683100	4687060	My name is Professor Alexander P. I
4687060	4688900	live in the bottom of a urinal.
4693860	4695860	Go, Dan.
4695860	4697420	Where are you now?
4697420	4698380	You know what?
4698380	4699380	It's OK.
4699380	4703860	All right.
4703860	4704660	All right.
4704660	4705140	That's good.
4705140	4706740	That's good.
4706740	4709260	That's enough of that song.
4709260	4710460	That's all we needed.
4710460	4712620	Yeah.
4712620	4714700	We know we're capable of generating hits.
4714700	4715700	Yes.
4715700	4716220	Absolutely.
4716220	4716700	This jacket.
4716700	4717540	God damn.
4717540	4718540	Isn't it amazing?
4718540	4719980	I love it.
4719980	4726500	Sarah, I loved you in the Apollo missions to the moon.
4726500	4727740	So you noticed me, huh?
4727740	4729140	Good, good, good.
4729140	4730900	It's a cheap shot.
4730900	4731940	He took a cheap shot at you.
4731940	4734740	You just did a rap and didn't let the two talented people sing.
4734740	4737420	They did great.
4737420	4738620	My mom's a kind of person.
4738620	4741620	She goes out with a regular coat and comes back and says,
4741620	4743900	look what I found at the shop.
4743900	4746220	She'll come in with like a full, like this.
4746220	4748180	And I'll go, where did you buy it?
4748180	4749540	Oh, you know, I can't remember.
4749540	4751500	But it was just like this great coat that was corning to me.
4751500	4753780	And I'm like, so now she has coats like this.
4753780	4754900	And like, what's the other?
4754900	4758780	You have like a geometric dress that has like corners in it.
4758780	4760260	And it's just like, you just come back
4760260	4762980	with the craziest clothes.
4763300	4765820	But you know what she said to me in the queue waiting to come in?
4765820	4767060	Your swag is out of control.
4767060	4767860	She goes, she goes.
4767860	4769860	It is, right?
4769860	4772700	Your swag is out of control.
4772700	4774500	Oh, now that would have been so cool.
4774500	4777420	Now she says, mom, you look just like a jacket potato
4777420	4778820	all wrapped up in foil.
4778820	4779860	No, no, no, no, no.
4779860	4780700	Don't make me sell me.
4780700	4781620	Oomnea, how dare you.
4781620	4783100	No, no, what I was saying was she
4783100	4784860	was kind of wrapping herself up.
4784860	4786300	And I was like, you look like a little big potato.
4786300	4786580	I did.
4786580	4787220	I looked like a potato.
4787220	4788420	She's like a little big potato.
4788420	4789740	She looks like a hot potato.
4789740	4790740	Hot potato.
4790740	4792060	Oh, shit.
4792060	4793020	All right, come on.
4793020	4796500	Do another rap, and I'll set them up better.
4796500	4799380	I don't like this critique that I wrapped it wrong
4799380	4800500	and they didn't get a chance.
4800500	4802260	Let me do the rap that frames them singing.
4802260	4804780	Do you think you could lay one of your own songs
4804780	4805500	on top of a beat?
4805500	4807660	Or does it have to be specific to?
4807660	4809660	She has to do Cold Air like Water in my life.
4809660	4810460	She has to.
4810460	4811860	Yeah, she has to.
4811860	4815220	You guys will be the Rihanna hook of my rap, which
4815220	4818500	will be purely to set you guys up.
4818500	4821020	My rap will be fucking.
4821020	4827100	And I'm going to take a, like I, it's uncharacteristic of me.
4827100	4828100	Two more shows, everybody.
4828100	4828580	Only two left.
4828580	4830060	I'm going to downplay the magnificence.
4830060	4833500	I'm going to spit less fire than I usually would so
4833500	4835220	that it frames you guys.
4835220	4835740	Thank you.
4835740	4839180	I'm going to lay in a relatively unremarkable rap
4839180	4842100	framework around you guys as a scaffolding.
4842100	4842900	Thank you.
4842900	4843500	You're welcome.
4843500	4844900	Yeah, we appreciate it.
4844900	4846660	Appreciate it.
4847300	4849300	Yeah.
4849300	4850780	Yeah.
4850780	4852100	Yeah.
4852100	4852820	Yeah.
4852820	4853780	Yeah.
4853780	4854860	Sing them, man.
4854860	4855460	Yeah.
4855460	4859020	My name is Mr. Rappy Rap.
4859020	4861020	I like to be in your lap.
4861020	4863780	I like to lay my head down on both of your thighs.
4863780	4866620	I like to put my ears up into the skies.
4866620	4870740	There are two skies and two clouds.
4870740	4872140	Yo, the rap's too loud.
4872140	4875540	I'm going to turn it down and let the people take over.
4875540	4879460	Fuck your mama roller over in the clover.
4879460	4881940	Oh, no.
4881940	4886420	Cold air like water in my lungs.
4886420	4891420	All day like water, and it's booming me under.
4891420	4895420	Oh, cold air like raindrops on my tongue.
4895420	4896420	Sing.
4896420	4897420	Take it down.
4897420	4902380	Cold air like sunshine, oh, make me like I was before.
4905860	4907860	Yo.
4907860	4910020	Go dance.
4910020	4910820	Break it down.
4910820	4914220	Mel, my name is Mr. Pants.
4914220	4916980	I like to sing and dance.
4916980	4921940	I went to your house, and I shrunk down to the size of a mouse.
4921940	4925060	I looked through your underwear drawer.
4925060	4927340	I saw your privacy and more.
4927340	4932020	I looked through your postcard, saw your dad, or the dad
4932020	4932740	you used to have.
4932740	4933220	Excuse me.
4936180	4941140	Cold air like water in my lungs.
4941140	4941620	Yo.
4941620	4946620	Don't get like water, oh, make me like I was before.
4946620	4951420	Oh, cold air like raindrops, raindrops, raindrops,
4951420	4953420	raindrops, yeah.
4953420	4955540	Woo, yeah.
4955540	4956540	Excuse me.
4956540	4958300	Knock, knock on the door.
4958300	4962540	I'm a lawyer, and I'm looking for, is there a Mr. Pants here?
4962540	4965020	Woo, woo.
4965980	4968980	Spencer.
4968980	4974340	Well, I'm here to deliver you a subpoena.
4974340	4977820	I heard that you called my mama, and you took out your wiener.
4977820	4979900	I want to find out if you're bad.
4979900	4982500	I want to take you to court, make your face up with my dad.
4982500	4984220	You're going to have to go down.
4984220	4986340	Also, I don't want to get too wise,
4986340	4988700	but now you're going to have to harmonize.
4988700	4989180	Woo.
4989180	4993500	Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.
4993500	4994980	Good girl.
4994980	4996980	Yeah, you're looking to harmonize with me.
4996980	4999580	Mr. Pants, that was better than I expected.
4999580	5001580	Uh-huh.
5001580	5003420	Oh, that was good.
5003420	5007660	I guess a Mr. Pants is a representation.
5007660	5009140	Woo.
5009140	5013140	And I'm telling you, this ain't Mr. Pants you're looking for.
5013140	5015140	This is the wrong house, guys.
5015980	5019460	Yeah.
5019460	5020460	Wrong subpoena.
5020460	5021340	All right.
5021340	5022420	I can't afford it.
5022420	5024180	Yeah, thank you.
5024180	5025660	All right.
5025660	5026500	That is amazing.
5031260	5032540	You see, I don't improvise.
5032540	5033940	I don't improvise very well.
5033940	5035860	No, I think you did a great job.
5035860	5039340	I think we're trying to coach mama into the spotlight,
5039340	5042220	and she was like, nope, PhD.
5042220	5044260	And the whole time, she's whispering in my ears,
5045180	5048380	you see, I've got to that time in my life
5048380	5051700	where I step back, let the young ones shine.
5051700	5052660	And they shine.
5052660	5054140	But you're probably our age.
5056700	5057700	Oh, be careful.
5057700	5058700	I'm 57.
5058700	5059700	Maybe we should step back.
5059700	5060700	Yeah.
5060700	5061700	Close.
5061700	5062700	I'm older.
5062700	5063700	Yeah.
5063700	5064700	Yeah.
5064700	5065700	And what kind of medicine again?
5065700	5066700	What kind of doctor?
5066700	5067700	I'm a pediatrician.
5067700	5068700	I'm also an adolescent physician,
5068700	5070700	so I see kids from like birth to like 23.
5070700	5071700	Nice.
5071700	5072700	Yeah.
5072700	5075780	So in other words, it's the kind of medicine
5075780	5080260	that's cowardly and won't come into this rap.
5080260	5082260	Hit it.
5082260	5084140	Oh, shit.
5084140	5086980	Because you don't give a shit.
5086980	5088940	You don't give a shit.
5088940	5090140	She don't give a shit.
5090140	5093500	She won't come into this rap because she don't give a shit.
5093500	5095700	My name is Mr. And Standy Rap.
5095700	5098860	I like to stand and rap the rap.
5098860	5100860	I always rap this rap.
5100860	5103860	I know, and I rap this rap, I never set a trap.
5103860	5106860	But you really don't think I'll come into this shit?
5106860	5107860	No.
5107860	5108860	No.
5108860	5109860	I'll come into this shit.
5109860	5110860	No.
5110860	5111860	No.
5111860	5112860	No.
5112860	5113860	Just wait.
5113860	5114860	I'll come and get you.
5114860	5116860	How dare you lady with your space jacket.
5116860	5119860	I don't think that your singing could even hack at you.
5119860	5122860	You need to deal with my rapping skills.
5122860	5125860	I wrecked your mama so hard on the hill.
5125860	5126860	Close.
5126860	5127860	You should talk about it.
5127860	5129860	I can't rap that tone down, Harmon.
5129860	5132860	How dare you speak to me that way, John Harmon.
5132860	5134860	Here I gotcha.
5134860	5136860	Go rap, go rap.
5136860	5137860	You're gonna have to talk back.
5137860	5139860	Go rap, go rap.
5139860	5140860	Gonna have to talk back.
5140860	5142860	I ain't showing nothing more to say.
5142860	5144860	I can't rap.
5144860	5148860	I don't, I don't believe that you can sing it.
5148860	5150860	I'm gonna do it instead.
5150860	5151860	It's another thing.
5151860	5161860	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
5161860	5164860	Can you handle that?
5164860	5169860	I was going to say, I was going to say that I'm gonna give up,
5169860	5172860	and then I heard and I thought that's crap.
5172860	5173860	Oh, shit.
5173860	5177860	So whether you want to or not, you gotta talk back,
5177860	5179860	because I don't know how to rap.
5179860	5180860	Oh, shit.
5180860	5182860	But you can sing, so that's another thing,
5182860	5187860	and here I'm gonna put out my ding-a-ling, and here, oh, here it is.
5187860	5189860	One, two, three, four.
5189860	5192860	And then going to four, I don't know.
5192860	5196860	I mean, can't, I mean, what does it take to get you to sing?
5196860	5204860	At last, my man has come along.
5204860	5205860	Sing it, son.
5205860	5209860	My lonely days are over.
5209860	5213860	And my love is like a song.
5213860	5215860	My love is like a song.
5215860	5221860	Now I all sing before she'll sing.
5221860	5222860	How about that song?
5222860	5223860	Well, it's a good day, and it wasn't a song.
5223860	5224860	Let me give her mom a song.
5224860	5225860	She's ready to go.
5225860	5226860	She got the flavor.
5226860	5228860	You got it?
5228860	5232860	Then this God shall give.
5232860	5236860	Well, then this not shall lose.
5236860	5242860	So the Bible says, and it still is new.
5242860	5249860	So your mama may have, and your papa may have,
5249860	5256860	but God bless the child that's got his own.
5256860	5259860	That's got his own.
5259860	5260860	Mom!
5260860	5264860	Yeah!
5264860	5266860	All right, we coach you now, mama.
5266860	5270860	Why didn't it take us seven years to perfect Harman Town?
5270860	5277860	No amount of academia can bury the musician in you.
5277860	5278860	Thank you.
5278860	5279860	Thank you.
5279860	5280860	Thank you.
5280860	5282860	Well, can I just say it's a shame,
5282860	5286860	I mean like an enormous shame, that this is ending.
5286860	5289860	I'm so hoping that you do lots of other things,
5289860	5292860	because when we first really got to know about you,
5292860	5294860	Dan, it was with community.
5294860	5296860	Actually, my kids came and said,
5296860	5299860	you've got to come and watch this, mom, because it's so meta.
5299860	5301860	It's got all...
5301860	5303860	That's what we said.
5303860	5309860	They said it's got all these different levels of psychic thinking,
5309860	5313860	and this man is insanely brilliant,
5313860	5316860	and it's layers upon layers,
5316860	5319860	and it's the most intelligent thing, and they were right.
5319860	5322860	And then we watched these crazy episodes,
5322860	5324860	and then you did one with stop motion,
5324860	5326860	and then you did one with different timelines,
5326860	5330860	and you just go, whose brain is this?
5330860	5333860	And then you did the one with the puppets.
5333860	5334860	Zero Emmys.
5334860	5335860	Zero Emmys.
5335860	5343860	No, but I think Zero Emmys says more about them than you.
5343860	5347860	Because, right? Right?
5348860	5349860	You want to talk about meta.
5349860	5352860	He did a season where he wasn't even on the show.
5352860	5354860	That's fucking punk rock.
5354860	5356860	Can I just say, for the record,
5356860	5357860	I didn't watch it.
5357860	5359860	To this day, I still haven't watched it.
5359860	5361860	In protest, I was freaking mad.
5361860	5362860	Yeah.
5362860	5363860	I was so angry.
5363860	5364860	But then you knew we knew that.
5364860	5365860	But it tanked.
5365860	5367860	I mean, it tanked that season, and my girls,
5367860	5369860	and out of protest, they really did.
5369860	5371860	They refused to watch it.
5371860	5377860	And so I think that if people like you exist,
5377860	5379860	and the way that you write exists,
5379860	5383860	you've got to be out there doing a lot more.
5383860	5386860	Yeah, you got to.
5386860	5390860	Sarah, you might not be familiar with his morning workouts.
5390860	5391860	I am.
5391860	5392860	I am.
5392860	5393860	Oh, you are?
5393860	5394860	Oh, shit.
5394860	5396860	Now it's getting freaky.
5396860	5398860	Well, my daughters follow him.
5398860	5401860	So I know quite a bit about what else is going on.
5401860	5404860	But yeah, no, he needs to be doing more.
5404860	5405860	He really does.
5405860	5408860	Sarah, can we expatriate you to the States,
5408860	5411860	and we just keep you here in California?
5411860	5413860	Do you know we were thinking of getting a place here?
5413860	5414860	That's true.
5414860	5415860	Yeah?
5415860	5416860	Yeah.
5416860	5417860	Is it hard to emigrate from anywhere?
5417860	5418860	Yeah.
5418860	5419860	It's hard for me, because, of course,
5419860	5421860	I've got all my patients back in the UK.
5421860	5422860	No, no, like...
5422860	5423860	Oh, generally?
5423860	5425860	Yes, I think so.
5425860	5426860	Yes.
5426860	5427860	You'll find out.
5428860	5431860	As long as you're in a shithole country.
5431860	5433860	Before we move forward, can I just say, Jeff,
5433860	5435860	I didn't know that on my bucket list
5435860	5437860	was hearing you sing with my mom.
5437860	5438860	Like, that was...
5438860	5440860	Like, anyway, this is...
5440860	5441860	That was...
5441860	5442860	I'm going to wake up in five minutes.
5442860	5443860	Some of my favorite moments of my life,
5443860	5445860	I've been singing with strangers or people I've just met.
5445860	5447860	Like, I love to sing along more than anything in the world.
5447860	5448860	So nice.
5448860	5449860	It was so nice.
5449860	5450860	Anyway, you got a great voice.
5450860	5451860	Well, thank you very much.
5451860	5452860	Yeah, yeah.
5452860	5453860	I know you, that's for sure.
5453860	5454860	Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
5454860	5455860	No, no, thank you.
5455860	5456860	Thank you, but no.
5457860	5459860	Dan, you sounded good, too.
5459860	5460860	You sure did.
5460860	5461860	Thanks, guys.
5461860	5463860	You sure did, my hero.
5463860	5464860	Thank you.
5464860	5466860	Summertime.
5467860	5470860	And the living is easy.
5471860	5473860	Now, you see, that will be easy to harmonize, too.
5473860	5474860	Yeah.
5474860	5475860	Whatever that means.
5475860	5476860	Let's try it.
5476860	5478860	You know the melody to that, right?
5478860	5480860	I don't know the melody to that.
5480860	5481860	What do you mean?
5481860	5482860	You know the song.
5482860	5483860	No, I don't know.
5483860	5485860	Summertime and the living is easy.
5485860	5490860	Yeah, just sing that lightly and let one or both of them just sing along with you.
5490860	5496860	Summertime and the living is easy.
5496860	5497860	What are you making me do?
5497860	5498860	I don't know what you're making me do.
5498860	5500860	Jeff, this plan is really falling apart, Jeff.
5502860	5505860	I was trying to hear where your key was.
5505860	5507860	I don't know what I was making you do.
5507860	5508860	You picked a tough key.
5508860	5509860	You picked a tough key.
5509860	5510860	You were doing well.
5510860	5512860	Spencer.
5512860	5514860	Spencer.
5514860	5515860	Spencer.
5515860	5517860	And that's something we all enjoy.
5517860	5518860	Ice cream.
5518860	5519860	Spencer.
5519860	5520860	Ice cream.
5522860	5523860	Oh, man.
5523860	5524860	What a nice time.
5526860	5528860	So, let's make a record.
5528860	5529860	That would be awesome.
5529860	5530860	Do it.
5530860	5531860	Let's do that.
5531860	5533860	We leave on Saturday, so...
5534860	5535860	We've got some booth times.
5535860	5536860	We've got some time.
5536860	5537860	Dan, you know Kanye.
5537860	5539860	Let's fucking pull this shit together.
5539860	5541860	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
5541860	5542860	He's in Sunday school.
5542860	5543860	No, no, no.
5543860	5544860	No, no, no, no, no, no.
5544860	5545860	No, no, no.
5545860	5546860	Not Kanye.
5546860	5548860	He's the first Republican I've ever loved.
5548860	5549860	Whoa.
5550860	5551860	No.
5551860	5552860	No.
5552860	5553860	Not it, Chief.
5553860	5554860	No.
5554860	5557860	Do you feel let down by him?
5557860	5558860	Yes.
5558860	5559860	Like, yes.
5559860	5560860	Yes.
5560860	5562860	It's actually a British perspective on Kanye.
5562860	5563860	It's painful.
5563860	5565860	The British perspective on Kanye is basically...
5565860	5569860	Well, I mean the British black perspective on Kanye is basically the black perspective
5569860	5570860	on Kanye.
5570860	5572860	Like, we loved you during Katrina.
5574860	5575860	What?
5576860	5581860	We kind of feel that he's flown the coop a bit and we're like, what's going on?
5581860	5582860	How could you not?
5582860	5587860	When you have the power to build your own geodesic domes, he's just like, what do I do
5587860	5589860	to rebel against myself?
5589860	5590860	Yeah.
5591860	5594860	He's become a Ralph Bakshi cartoon.
5595860	5596860	Again, I don't know.
5597860	5600860	It's kind of the story of everyone I know now.
5600860	5603860	And like, meet these icons and I'm like, God damn it.
5603860	5604860	Can we all fuck him up?
5604860	5605860	You met Kanye?
5605860	5606860	Yeah.
5606860	5607860	Oh, yeah.
5607860	5608860	I met Kanye.
5608860	5609860	They're good friends.
5609860	5610860	You know, I thought that was like a known thing.
5610860	5612860	He came to the Rick and Morty office.
5612860	5613860	He was fucking cool, man.
5613860	5615860	Is he going to be on the show?
5615860	5617860	They made an episode together.
5617860	5618860	Is that a secret?
5619860	5621860	I may just not be in the loop.
5621860	5622860	No, don't say that.
5622860	5626860	I talked to him for like two and a half hours.
5626860	5629860	I found him to be truly like...
5630860	5632860	Didn't he steal Rob's hoodie?
5632860	5635860	He threw Rob's hoodie in the garbage.
5637860	5639860	We didn't talk about this.
5639860	5642860	Like Kanye came in because Kanye has like this thing.
5643860	5647860	The story sounds like I told it and none of you will believe it.
5648860	5651860	Kanye had this hoodie and he's like, the hoodie is the most important
5651860	5654860	article of clothing in the history of America or whatever.
5654860	5657860	And to his point, he's like, he's saying like,
5657860	5660860	because it's like poor people can buy a hoodie,
5660860	5661860	rich people want a hoodie, whatever.
5661860	5662860	That was his thing.
5662860	5665860	And then he was like, they had this big thick hoodie on.
5665860	5669860	And then he kept, he's pointing at Shrob and he's like,
5669860	5671860	what's that hoodie?
5671860	5672860	What's the deal?
5672860	5676860	Shrob with this fucking shitty sweatshirt.
5676860	5681860	And Kanye put it on and was like, see, what the fuck is this?
5681860	5683860	No, he didn't put it on right away.
5683860	5686860	And he looked at the tag and he was like, H and M.
5686860	5689860	And he was like, bewildered by it.
5689860	5691860	He's like, H and M.
5691860	5693860	And then we lost track of it for a while.
5693860	5696860	And an hour later, we're like, where's Shrob's hoodie?
5696860	5698860	It was in the garbage.
5699860	5704860	Kanye West threw Rob's hoodie in the fucking garbage.
5704860	5707860	Like it was a dirty Kleenex he found on the coffee table.
5707860	5712860	And it wasn't a bit like, I'll be the first guy to tell you,
5712860	5716860	Kanye West is an intelligent guy with a huge,
5716860	5718860	he's capable of having a sense of humor about himself.
5718860	5721860	We talked a bunch about how it would be funny.
5721860	5724860	You could change my mind about him because the only reason
5724860	5727860	I don't feel happy about Kanye is because I haven't talked
5727860	5729860	to Kanye about what the hell is going on.
5729860	5731860	And I never will because I'm a pleb.
5731860	5735860	He's super charismatic and there's absolutely nobody that's going to,
5735860	5738860	everything you've seen about him is curated through.
5738860	5741860	And if you wear the wrong hoodie, that's in the fucking trash can.
5741860	5744860	But that was crazy.
5744860	5747860	It was like, Rob's hoodie was in the trash can.
5747860	5750860	And we were all like, Rob's hoodie is in the trash can.
5750860	5755860	And Kanye was like, he didn't, he didn't own it.
5755860	5757860	Like it was like, did he,
5757860	5760860	did he have somebody else around or he actually said this,
5760860	5763860	I truly believe this isn't even clothing to me.
5763860	5767860	So this belong to Rob's hoodie in the garbage.
5767860	5770860	He didn't even care that you saw it because no one saw it until it was
5770860	5771860	in the garbage.
5771860	5774860	He wore it for a while because he wore it for a while.
5774860	5775860	And he was like...
5775860	5776860	Well, he actually tried his on to prove a point.
5776860	5778860	Yeah, he was wearing Shrobs hoodie for a while.
5778860	5781860	And he was like, man, I look built in this.
5781860	5783860	Like because Shrobs hoodie was smaller.
5783860	5786860	But then it disappeared after a while and it was just gone.
5786860	5788860	And then we were like, where's Shrobs hoodie?
5788860	5790860	It's in the garbage.
5790860	5794860	And they were like, Kanye, did you throw Rob's hoodie in the garbage?
5794860	5798860	Kanye West, did you throw Rob's hoodie in the garbage?
5799860	5802860	If he had done it as a joke, he would have been like, ha ha.
5802860	5804860	He was like, huh?
5804860	5809860	And that's when I knew that guy is fucking on top of the world.
5809860	5812860	Or he was like, he actually, when he was realizing in that moment,
5812860	5815860	he was like, yeah, I probably did.
5815860	5818860	But actually, I shouldn't have.
5818860	5821860	When you mind him being on the phone while you asked him that,
5821860	5824860	was he ordering Shrobs a new Kanye hoodie?
5824860	5826860	No, we were in a room together.
5827860	5829860	The waste craft was next to him.
5829860	5832860	And he was on his phone and he was like, huh?
5832860	5835860	But there was no contrition, no acknowledgment of the crime.
5835860	5840860	He was like, we were like, Kanye, did you throw Rob Shrobs hoodie
5840860	5843860	in the garbage can with all of the garbage?
5843860	5847860	And he was like, including all his entourage,
5847860	5849860	he had these cool dudes with him.
5849860	5851860	I will also say that.
5851860	5854860	Kanye's got fucking cool dudes around him.
5854860	5855860	How cool?
5856860	5862860	Two really cool dudes who have been hanging out with him forever,
5862860	5864860	like super cool dudes.
5864860	5869860	And then one dude who scared the shit out of me.
5869860	5871860	That's the security, right?
5871860	5878860	Yeah, like this crazy white dude in fucking paramilitary gear
5878860	5883860	who I didn't notice until I went to the bathroom outside the writer's room
5883860	5885860	and then I was like, huh?
5885860	5888860	And the guy was like, huh?
5888860	5892860	His job was, he had one job just to make sure.
5892860	5893860	I'm going to say he has two jobs.
5893860	5898860	One is when Kanye hands off a hoodie, his job is to dispose of the hoodie.
5898860	5900860	No, that guy had nothing to do with any of that shit.
5900860	5902860	That guy's job was to fucking,
5902860	5905860	as soon as he checked the perimeter of the writer's room,
5905860	5908860	his head ducked in and he was looking around
5908860	5910860	and he's like, what's going on?
5910860	5912860	What's this room that Kanye's going into?
5912860	5915860	And then he fucking stood post outside the writer's room
5915860	5916860	and he was out there.
5916860	5920860	I went to pee and I made the huge mistake of like,
5920860	5922860	I came back from peeing and I was like,
5922860	5925860	I made some joke or something like,
5925860	5928860	thanks for letting me pee, like nothing, stupid.
5928860	5932860	And he just steered through me like a terminator
5932860	5936860	and I was like, holy shit, he will kill me.
5936860	5938860	Like if I make the slightest wrong move,
5938860	5942860	his job is to keep anyone from getting in this room and killing Kanye.
5942860	5945860	Because his boss is a motherfucking monster.
5945860	5946860	No, he's not a monster.
5946860	5947860	Don't, don't.
5947860	5948860	I won't let it.
5948860	5951860	I've defended Kanye from the fucking moment.
5951860	5953860	No, it's a lyric from a song, Dan.
5953860	5954860	Don't get afraid.
5954860	5955860	Can I...
5955860	5956860	He's not a monster.
5956860	5957860	He's not a monster.
5957860	5959860	Can I poke holes in his logic?
5959860	5962860	If his idea is that, oh, hoodies, they're for everybody
5962860	5966860	and that even the people who can't afford very good hoodies
5966860	5970860	can work hoodies, why did he throw Robs in the trash?
5970860	5972860	If the idea was that hoodies are egalitarian...
5972860	5974860	I don't think he knew he threw Robs in the trash.
5974860	5975860	Oh, it was just like, every flex.
5975860	5976860	That's the thing is, I don't think...
5976860	5977860	He's cleaning up.
5977860	5978860	He...
5978860	5980860	I truly think that, consciously, in his mind,
5980860	5981860	he thought he was throwing it on his diaper.
5981860	5982860	Can I extend...
5982860	5983860	Oh, no.
5983860	5987860	Can I extend Kanye's some meaningless benefits of meaningless doubts.
5987860	5990860	He tried on Rob's Rob's hoodie.
5990860	5992860	It was a little too small for him.
5992860	5995860	He felt a little flexed up and he goes, you know what?
5995860	5997860	I didn't take a shower today.
5997860	5999860	Or I put on too much cologne today.
5999860	6001860	I can't give this back to him.
6001860	6002860	He's gonna...
6002860	6003860	Or I spilled some...
6003860	6004860	No.
6004860	6007860	I spilled some chili on it while I was wearing...
6007860	6008860	He liked the structure.
6008860	6009860	And he felt bad about it.
6009860	6010860	And he fucking loved to Shropp.
6010860	6012860	Like, Kanye was fixated on Shropp.
6012860	6014860	Aww.
6014860	6015860	Like, he loved Shropp.
6015860	6016860	Really straight.
6016860	6017860	Who doesn't?
6017860	6018860	Okay, so he has good taste.
6018860	6019860	It's really straight.
6019860	6020860	And then he left...
6020860	6022860	And I won't let anybody talk shit.
6022860	6024860	Wasn't there a dissertation on why one hoodie
6024860	6025860	was better than the other?
6025860	6026860	You let me and Elon Musk.
6026860	6027860	I won't let anyone say shit about Elon Musk.
6027860	6030860	Elon, Elon, I won't let people talk shit about him either.
6030860	6032860	And Kanye won't let people talk shit about Elon.
6032860	6034860	Well, probably won't talk shit about Elon Musk.
6034860	6035860	But it's not like...
6035860	6037860	Because Kanye was like...
6037860	6039860	His favorite movie is The Aviator.
6039860	6040860	And I'm like, me too, me too.
6040860	6042860	Show me all the blueprints.
6042860	6045860	Let's all look at all the blueprints.
6045860	6047860	It's like, what are we doing?
6047860	6048860	I wanna...
6048860	6052860	Don't you have security cameras at the Rick and Morty
6052860	6054860	to know exactly what happened to Rob's hoodie?
6054860	6056860	He threw in the fucking garbage.
6056860	6057860	What are we telling you?
6057860	6058860	It's not a mystery.
6058860	6059860	It's not a mystery.
6059860	6061860	If Kanye would be here and he'd go,
6061860	6063860	yeah, he threw Rob's hoodie in the garbage.
6063860	6065860	Because it was tragic.
6065860	6066860	Because he didn't want it anymore.
6066860	6069860	Because for a second, he was like, this is garbage.
6069860	6070860	That was his whole point.
6070860	6071860	He had this whole hoodie.
6071860	6074860	What a privilege to be able to just work on your impulses.
6074860	6075860	This is garbage in the trash.
6075860	6077860	He's married to Kim Kardashian.
6077860	6079860	Exactly.
6079860	6081860	He's got all the privileges.
6081860	6083860	He's got Kanye West privileges.
6083860	6086860	To his point, the US press has been totally...
6086860	6092860	They never said, hey, Kanye is a fucking billionaire.
6092860	6096860	They'll celebrate a Kardashian before him.
6096860	6098860	I get that.
6098860	6101860	I get his fucking...
6101860	6103860	I got the shtick while it was a stick
6103860	6105860	that some people didn't like.
6105860	6110860	I think this bent towards republicanism is a bit weird
6110860	6113860	because he was like, George Bush doesn't care
6113860	6114860	about black people.
6114860	6115860	I know.
6115860	6116860	He's not the same guy.
6116860	6117860	He's not the same guy.
6117860	6121860	Trump is crazy for black people.
6121860	6123860	Trump loves his black people.
6123860	6125860	Truly, I don't even come from a position of like...
6125860	6126860	I've kind of almost gone to the point
6126860	6128860	where I just don't pay attention to what he does
6128860	6130860	because I'm confused.
6130860	6132860	Well, you don't want to put your eggs in that basket.
6132860	6133860	You shouldn't.
6133860	6136860	I've got a friend who knows that he's like kooky
6136860	6138860	and does his weird stuff, but he loves his music
6138860	6140860	and he's like, the new record's really good.
6140860	6141860	Is it?
6141860	6143860	And he goes, I listen to it ten times a day.
6143860	6144860	I can't get invested.
6144860	6145860	Twelve platinum albums?
6145860	6148860	How many fucking platinum albums does a guy have to do
6148860	6151860	before you go like, whatever you say is fucking...
6151860	6154860	I can't do whatever you say no matter how many platinum albums
6154860	6155860	you got, my dude.
6155860	6157860	But if he was white...
6157860	6161860	If he was white, there are white people
6161860	6163860	that have done really great things,
6163860	6164860	who have done stuff that I don't agree with,
6164860	6166860	that I still don't kind of support.
6166860	6167860	With twelve platinum albums?
6168860	6169860	Well...
6169860	6171860	Umni, if you're going to make it in this music industry,
6171860	6173860	you're going to have to drop some of that fucking integrity.
6176860	6178860	Cliff Hager!

6224860	6225860	I'm your fucking comptroller.
6225860	6227860	Maybe one day I will be.
6227860	6229860	Only 17 more shows to go.
6229860	6230860	I'm Jeff Davis.
6230860	6233860	Let's give it up for your mayor, Dan Harmon, everybody.
