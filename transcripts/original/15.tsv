0	13240	Ladies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session.
13240	14640	Welcome to the Nerd Melt Theater.
14640	16440	How are you all tonight?
16440	20320	Thank you, loyal Harmonians, for coming.
20320	26080	Thank you for listening out there in the podcast to Ether.
26360	28840	Please put your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown,
28840	29840	Dan Harmon.
41840	42960	Thank you.
42960	44160	I got nothing tonight.
44160	45840	I got nothing.
45840	47160	Nothing to talk about.
47160	49160	See me after the show.
49160	51560	You may have your $10 back.
51560	55320	I'm looking at my phone because I said to people,
55400	56680	what do you want me to talk about?
56680	57480	Got any questions?
57480	59280	Hashtag Harmontown.
59280	62920	Some people are, you guys did good.
62920	64200	Thank you.
64200	65280	I'm a good audience.
65280	67480	I don't want you to mistake my low energy tonight
67480	72120	for lack of love because I often edit the Harmontown podcast.
72120	74400	We took a little break.
74400	77680	So I edited two in a row over at Puny Studios
77680	78560	with Dustin Marshall.
78560	82600	And you know, I missed you guys.
82600	84760	And you're a good audience.
84880	86880	You're good people.
86880	87680	Shut up.
92120	94400	I got nothing tonight.
94400	95600	I have no passion.
95600	96920	I have no topics.
96920	99560	I'm not sad.
99560	102000	I don't have anything to be sad about.
102000	103120	I have a lot of money.
103120	106880	And I have so much food that I have extra food
106880	107840	stored in my body.
111840	113960	I have extra beds in my house.
113960	115640	So I'm like the opposite of homeless.
122280	125000	I'm so I got nothing to complain about, really.
125000	127560	Why are you so sedate?
127560	130080	I think it's just bio-biorhythms.
130080	132600	I've been really negative the last few days.
132600	133600	I've been really cranky.
133600	136520	And I've been in a bad mood all the time for no reason.
136520	138000	Everything's great.
138000	140320	You kind of gave my girlfriend a dressing down
140320	141800	at the drawing room.
142680	143680	I was pleasant about it.
147680	150080	Seemed from her reaction that you were pretty mean.
150080	151920	She has a high value on your opinion.
151920	152520	That's wrong.
152520	155880	And I told her how I felt.
155880	157960	I didn't beat her up about it.
157960	159120	You said how you felt.
159120	162040	It was her behavior in the last show,
162040	164640	where she called on her cell phone.
164640	168200	He said that was the last straw.
168200	169720	Like you have a last straw.
169720	172640	No, the words was that was the limit of my endurance.
176840	180520	I'm not cliche.
180520	183240	Well, she's not not here tonight because she killed herself.
183240	185720	You'll be happy to know.
185720	186720	It never occurred to me.
186720	190040	She's doing a show or something.
190040	192480	But you know, she could have killed herself.
196680	199600	Then maybe you would have apologized.
200200	202200	Maybe.
202200	204920	She called you in the middle of the show.
204920	205840	So what?
205840	209240	Adam Goldberg wanders up here like a nincompoop.
209240	210600	This show has no format.
210600	212160	There's nothing to protect.
212160	213600	It's not a diamond mine.
213600	216120	It's a tree house.
216120	220560	It's full of empty popcorn bags.
220560	222240	I'm Tori Amos all of a sudden.
222240	227840	It's a turtle racing a grapefruit.
231080	233520	I thought I favorited some of the questions.
233520	234680	I'm sorry for the live people.
234680	237040	They're looking at a guy looking at his phone, which is now a new.
237040	238560	It's like sending a signal to you that I'm not
238560	241040	interested in what you're saying.
241040	241560	I am.
241560	242840	I'm looking at my phone because I.
242840	244760	This is a new jacket you're wearing tonight, Dan.
244760	248640	You kind of have like an Al and Alda mash field jacket kind of thing.
248640	250880	Yeah, well, we've got a break in the weather.
250880	252160	Oh, I know what I did wrong.
252160	258840	I pressed the Dan Harmon button, which is my favorite button.
258840	261680	What I have to do is I have to search for Harmon town.
261680	264480	OK, and then I should see some of these two dads.
264480	266000	I think I don't know.
266000	267600	Did I fuck it up somehow?
267600	270800	I thought I welcome to Hollywood, California, everybody, the entertainment
270800	272480	capital of the world.
272480	274720	OK, so here's an example.
274720	277720	Dopaminee at Dopaminee.
277720	280840	Says if you were born 200 years ago, what would you do for a living?
281840	283680	That's a really good question, right?
283680	286600	That's just an example of a great question.
286600	290240	So like if I if I was if I had some passion tonight, I would have like
290240	291600	an amazing answer for that.
291600	292840	I think that would be very intriguing.
292840	295560	So you were born in the year 1870.
295560	296880	What are you two 73?
296880	298280	I guess, yeah.
298280	299680	OK, so 1873.
299680	303320	Yeah, let's make it 1820.
303320	304640	No, no, no, no, 1830.
304640	305880	You're 17 years old.
305880	308520	What are you doing in 18 1830?
308520	309720	Obviously, I would be a writer.
309760	311960	I'm I'm I'm a timeless genius.
314000	318240	I'd love to be able to say I'd be an elephant trainer because the World's
318240	322200	Fair would be coming up and Mr. Edison would need a new elephant.
322760	324760	No, no, it's like I transcend.
324760	326720	I'm like a I'm like a time lord.
327760	334520	My talent is if I was born in the year 3000 B.C., I'd I'd I'd invent writing.
336440	338320	I'm I'm I'm a god.
339920	343440	What do you think you would write about if you were in the year 3000 B.C.?
343440	344760	Whatever, whatever, whatever.
344760	347840	Got me a nice piece of cave.
349400	352960	Remember in ABC's cavemen, they used to say in ABC's cavemen,
352960	354480	they used to say stuff like that.
354480	355480	They were at one time.
355480	357400	They use cave like the Smurfs you in Smurfy.
357400	358840	Yeah, they would get they were looking at it.
358840	361680	They were looking at a female cave cavewoman that was working
361680	365800	at like a pink berry and Nick Curl's character was looking at her butt
365800	368600	and said, man, I'd like to carve me off a nice piece of that cave.
369320	370320	What?
371960	374320	First of all, that doesn't make any sense.
374320	377520	Second of all, to the extent that I forced my brain to make it make sense,
377520	379280	gross because caves are holes.
379280	380680	And then I start to think of vaginas.
380680	383280	And now I'm thinking of carving off vaginas.
383280	385880	And that's and you made me do that, Geico.
389000	391000	Anyways, here's another great one.
391000	393760	Is there a plan to take Harmontown on tour anytime soon?
394000	395800	I'm going to I'm going to have to say yes.
395800	397360	Yes. We're going to.
397400	400560	I I thought that would get a bigger response, but then I realized you guys are.
400840	402760	Why would you?
402760	404080	You don't care.
404080	406040	Yeah, you're leaving.
406880	408840	Get the hell out of here.
408840	412400	It's the it's the applause from a little little iPhone that I'm hearing
412400	415960	from the people in in New York and Chicago and things.
416120	418560	Yeah, I think I think in January, that's where we're having
418560	420120	preliminary conversations about this.
420120	422400	I think what I'm going to do, because I'm turning 40,
422800	426800	like maybe get 50 people or so to show up in little cities
426800	427880	across the country.
427880	432400	So I think in January, we'll we'll take a little bus and we'll go around
432400	437400	and we'll we'll we'll do this to two people in different cities.
438840	442520	And I want to record it and take some Channel 101 kids with us.
442720	445080	They're not kids anymore. They're they're 48 years old.
446760	449520	But, you know, take them with us, do some nice recordings in the
449520	452920	in the little little little black boxes and cabarets throughout the country.
453240	456000	And then come home with hundreds of hours of footage.
456200	459640	And then just throw it on some other Channel 101 kid and go, edit this.
460720	464440	And I'll just I'll just sit at home snorting coke off of a piranha.
468600	470440	That's the only way I get high anymore. Yeah.
471400	475600	Speaking of addictions, I'm all I think this might be part of why I'm all
475600	476800	like I got nothing tonight.
476800	478840	I'm addicted to five hour energies.
479200	482120	I even I call them I call them five H E's now.
483280	485360	It barely takes less time to say.
485360	489800	Like it's basically the same amount of energy, but I'm obsessed with energy,
489800	492040	I guess it's fucking up my throat.
492040	493240	I got bad acid reflux.
493240	496480	I'm taking like Zantac on top of Prilosec to counteract
496480	498120	the effects of these five hour energies.
498120	500160	I'm taking one or two a day.
500160	503440	I mean, if you need 10 hours of energy, that's another way of saying,
503440	506960	just take a nap, like 10 hours of energy is your deficit.
506960	509400	Then just take take the day off and go to sleep.
509760	512680	What are you 10 hours of energy?
512680	514920	That's not good, Jeff.
514920	519400	I've been addicted to worse things, but but but this is making barf in my throat.
519600	522080	Yeah, does it taste like poop, too?
522760	523600	It doesn't taste good.
523600	526040	It tastes like energy, you know, it does it.
526040	527760	I don't think they want it to taste like too good
527760	530000	because then you wouldn't believe that it was giving you energy,
530000	532320	which I don't think it is.
532320	534520	To be quite honest, I've never felt energized by those things.
534520	536440	I think it's I think it's a much higher.
536440	540280	Well, I say I accidentally took two on top of each other once.
540280	542800	Like like like like like took one forgot.
542800	547680	I took one like an like I think an hour into one.
547680	551440	I took another and I there is something in them
552480	554720	because there is such a thing as too much.
554720	559200	I remember I remember like I like right before I took the second one,
559600	563800	I I picked a fight with Aaron and and then she heard
563800	567440	a totally justified response of what about what a piece of shit
567440	570960	I was that night was like coming back on me socially
571120	572760	as I was starting to freak out.
572760	573720	I was there.
573720	577320	I was just like laying in the bed that I made with my girlfriend.
577320	580120	But and also going like, baby, please, please come on.
580400	582200	Come on, take it easy.
582200	584080	I got I took two five hour energy.
584080	585080	I can't handle this.
585080	587040	Yeah. But why? What did you mean before? I'm sorry.
587040	589680	I'm sorry. It was it was a pretty it was pretty weird.
589920	591600	It was kind of it was like the scene in the fifth element
591600	594080	of the guys choking on the strawberry or whatever the fuck.
597080	599720	Yes, this is Rob Shrab clapping.
599720	601880	Rob, Rob Shrab is in the house.
601880	604520	Is that right? Hello, Rob.
607680	611800	Let's see, man, I really I sat I sat in the green room
611800	614680	and I favorited things that I wanted to respond to.
614680	617760	And but I guess I guess you guys did such a good job
618720	621200	of tweeting stuff at me that I.
621240	623000	Are you playing sparkle right now?
623000	626920	Eric Mezcaval says, I know you're a Joe, Joe Campbell guy.
628040	629600	Who else influences your writing?
629600	631680	Are you a McKee fan? Goldman?
632800	635240	No, I don't know.
635240	637200	I don't know why I favorited that, if that's all I was going to say.
640280	643200	I don't know what I was thinking.
643200	645840	Not really a question, but if you ever find your way to Colorado,
645840	649120	let me buy you a drink. OK, it's no problem.
651000	652160	Maybe this is hurting things,
652160	654120	me holding this phone and scrolling through the things.
654120	656080	Maybe I maybe I need to cut myself loose.
656080	659080	It's not Cirque du Soleil. I'll tell you that much.
659080	661840	Right. I mean, I don't know if it's going to be because I put the phone down,
661840	664680	but I don't think that I don't know if the phone is helping.
665280	667840	Are you preoccupied or are you just one of those weird like kind of
669880	672520	mental, I'm mad at you for being mean to my girlfriend.
672560	674120	Was it mean to her? You were there when it happened.
674120	676240	It was very brief. I said it very, very succinctly.
676240	679760	I didn't I didn't hear what you said, but it took a couple of seconds.
679760	681960	And I just I just I told her she was bumming me the fuck out.
682120	688480	Well, I mean, you but yeah, I mean, you you you
689200	693200	like told her that she I'm curious to know
693240	697440	did a bad thing to the show and that the audience didn't like what I said.
697440	698400	It's not what I said.
698400	700880	I really wanted to know what the I would love to have heard
700880	702640	the journalism that she reported to you.
702640	704120	I didn't know that you guys were going.
704120	707600	I didn't know we were at the drawing room and I told there.
707600	710720	And I was like, oh, I gave her like, you know, a little, you know,
710720	714120	a couple of minutes to get some shit off my chest.
714440	716120	And then I didn't know that right after that,
716120	718080	you guys were going to go have a romantic dinner together,
718080	721280	which I apparently must have poisoned by having a conversation.
721280	722360	So I'm sorry for that.
722360	724640	Well, no, it was fascinating.
730400	733200	So there's that there's that putting a ding in my energy.
733440	736200	I'm not going to blame you for for for anything, though.
738880	740400	Let's blame Eric.
742400	745000	I got to blame anybody for anything.
745000	747960	Let's let's blame everything on NT.
748320	749880	How are you, NT?
754400	757040	And he wasn't was it? What's it like?
759840	762960	Come on, you know, we all want to know
763520	765480	to be a student.
765880	768120	Oh, you're not a student. OK.
770960	773520	Is anti literally the only black?
773520	775640	No, no, OK. All right.
776560	779160	My my searchlights went bang.
779160	780000	I was I was scared.
780000	784720	Sometimes it is literally the only African-American Armenian here.
784720	786840	And I what's that like?
786840	788200	That's what I'm really curious about.
788200	790640	Although I know words that it doesn't the words don't matter.
790880	792200	It's not like anything.
792200	795600	It's like I think I have I have five black friends, maybe.
795720	799080	And I think if you got them all in a room together,
801000	802640	I think the one thing they would all agree on
802640	805480	is that they're pretty sick and tired of being reminded by me that they're black.
805640	811880	And probably that would probably a microcosm for white America.
811880	812560	They probably are.
812560	816080	They probably wish that they could they could get through a day for like
816360	818520	and just forget about it.
818520	822040	That's a that's a that's a luxury that white people have.
822040	824280	When's the last time you stopped in the middle of the sidewalk and went,
824280	826400	oh, shit, I'm white like so.
826400	829640	So it probably had something to do with a black person being involved.
830120	833400	Like you didn't just do it in a vacuum.
833920	838200	This is this is this is it's not it's not a homogeneous society yet.
838800	840440	It's not happening.
840440	841360	It's black people out there.
841360	843000	They're in pain. Next time you see one.
845280	846920	Don't don't give them money.
846920	849280	That's that's not what they want.
849280	851520	That's racist.
851520	854360	Give them don't give them five.
854360	857080	It's even more racist.
857080	859280	What is the give them a hug?
859280	861200	What if the fight was really high?
861200	864720	Well, I don't know, because if it's if it's if it's if it's high enough,
864720	867000	then the next one's going to be way down low.
867000	870560	Yeah. And then you were the risk of being too slow. Yeah.
871520	874000	And by the time you finish with that whole thing,
874000	876520	you're the most racist person in the world.
879720	881720	Let's talk about race.
882720	884280	Finally.
885960	888120	What's your favorite race?
888120	889800	That's a good question.
889800	893640	And by that, I mean, which which which is more fascinating to you,
893640	894920	black people or Asian people?
894920	897080	Who's more fascinating? Oh, easily black people.
898160	900680	No, black people hands down like like like like.
900680	903160	Favorite favorite race to think about.
903480	905640	What race would I want to be?
907560	909000	No offense to our Asian friends.
909000	911080	It's it's you know, you're doing fine.
911080	913880	There's billions of you.
915200	919280	But I just the hit, you know, America was literally built
919280	925600	on this this this practice that is that we then were the first country
925600	927640	to say, OK, now this is illegal.
927640	932440	It's just a fascinating the national psyche, the fact that the social implications,
932440	938160	the the the swirling meta like like like racism within non-racism,
938160	941120	within racism, within non-racism, what the definition of it is.
941120	943440	Like there's no there's no better
944920	948240	way to examine it than with white people and black people.
948240	952040	And no offense to our our our beautiful beige friends.
953120	954280	But but fuck you.
954280	957360	I mean, it's bush league stuff like who cares?
957800	962920	White and black's where it's at when it comes to race obsession.
962960	965760	How racist would 1830s writer Dan Harmon have been?
968240	969400	I mean, you've got to be kidding me.
969400	972200	Because that was kind of the sweet spot for American racism.
972320	974760	Well, really think about it's an uncomfortable thing to think about.
974760	976800	Like, like, really think about the world.
976920	980400	Well, I was thinking about this just recently and I can't remember why.
980680	983920	But it's like because somebody was like somebody was getting kind of high
983920	987360	handed in some conversation and I didn't like I didn't want to be like a David
987360	991360	Cross character and like kind of like call him out on it and have a big argument.
991360	994240	But I was talking to somebody and they were kind of like
994840	999640	it they said something that made me realize that they very much take it
999640	1005680	for granted, the fact that as a nation, we were very, very wrong
1005680	1009560	for a very long time and that we haven't changed that much.
1009600	1014320	It's only been a certain amount of time and that we all we all kind of
1014320	1017680	inherit this world. We act like, oh, those aren't my sins.
1017680	1020120	Those aren't some of us are kind of nasty about it.
1020120	1023200	You're like, well, I didn't have slaves.
1023200	1026200	So, excuse me.
1026680	1028760	You're making quite a bit of noise in the popcorn line.
1030520	1032280	And it's not my fault.
1032280	1033240	And you know what?
1033240	1035760	I saw that movie that you guys made.
1035760	1038360	And if a white person made that movie, it would not be fair.
1039120	1041160	You'd get all mad about it.
1041160	1045800	I think that I think that there's a there's like people don't.
1045840	1050440	There's a naiveté there because like really like like like as recently
1050440	1055680	as the 1930s, there was this whole thing in Europe that got really on a hand.
1055680	1061520	I know I know none of us were there,
1061520	1066560	but I also know that that it wasn't an entire generation of monsters.
1066560	1071560	Like they weren't like vampires from a from a cereal box that that all decide.
1071600	1075840	It's like we all humanity has it in it to be, you know, very cruel, very evil.
1075840	1079200	And and if the person to the left of you
1079200	1082760	and the person to the right of you is doing something wrong,
1083000	1086760	it we have the capacity in us to not look at it as wrong.
1087120	1089760	And it's the reason that's important isn't because
1090440	1094800	isn't to make ourselves feel guilty or to pat ourselves on the back for knowing it.
1095000	1098160	The reason why it's important to know that is relativity
1098160	1100880	so that you can actually extrapolate from that and go, OK,
1101080	1106440	so what's going on right now that everyone accepts is completely right
1106440	1110800	that 100 years from now might be absolutely fucking ridiculously wrong.
1111040	1114120	There could be a million things like that ghost hanging there.
1114120	1116800	What's that? Maybe that's offensive.
1116800	1119800	I don't know. I think that's not that's distracting.
1119800	1122680	I think we'll certainly look back on like not letting gay people get married.
1122680	1123760	We'll look at that.
1123760	1125080	Oh, yeah, we're definitely.
1125080	1127200	Yeah, we're doing that with the with the gay people now.
1127200	1130800	We're we're we're we're finally giving them up, giving them some props
1130800	1133120	and saying like, sorry, sorry about that.
1133120	1134680	Sorry, by the way, sorry.
1134680	1136840	Right. Last last last show.
1136840	1138440	I talked about that gay lesbian thing.
1138440	1143560	You know why I why I know about that gay lesbian shelter in in Los Angeles?
1143720	1148120	A guy tweeted me because in the wake of this big brew.
1149120	1151120	It was a small brew house like three in the morning.
1151120	1156480	It was between me and like three gay guys because my my brother tweeted.
1157280	1159000	God, I love my daughter.
1159000	1161760	And I tweeted at my brother fag.
1166000	1167000	Because it's funny.
1167000	1168320	I thought I thought it was funny.
1168320	1169880	I'm not defending it. It's funny.
1169880	1171680	It was it was a spur of the moment thing.
1171680	1174000	Like my brother tweeted, I love my daughter.
1174000	1175760	And I raised the 70s.
1175760	1176840	My big brother.
1176840	1178120	I'm from Wisconsin.
1178120	1181560	I just I just without thinking, without remembering that I'm like
1181560	1184600	the Colonel Sanders of NBC sitcom.
1184600	1188440	And, you know, like I just just kind of lost myself and kind of like we're on
1188440	1190480	Twitter like I'm not representing anybody.
1190480	1192480	I was just like fag.
1192480	1196560	And then like three guys who happen to be awake, you know, we're like you just
1196560	1198240	call one guy.
1198240	1201440	One guy said you call your brother a fag for loving his daughter.
1201440	1202240	What kind of monster are you?
1202240	1204200	I was like, well, that guy is just explaining the joke.
1204200	1208880	Like that's that's like I'm not I'm not apologizing to that guy.
1208880	1210040	That's you just don't.
1210040	1210920	I mean, that's funny.
1210920	1212320	That's ironic. It's funny.
1212320	1215040	But then other people were like, you know, that word is really hurtful
1215040	1217600	and you know, kind of like bringing me back down to Earth.
1217600	1219480	And it's it's it's it's really true.
1219480	1222160	Like, like, like, do you know when when I was
1222920	1225880	when I was eight years old, nine years old, 10 years old.
1227160	1229360	And I'm so glad you're here so you can forgive me for this.
1233320	1236720	Just like, like, like we're going to give
1236720	1240840	anti a black people wand and he's going to he's going to touch me with it after this.
1244480	1245600	Maybe he won't.
1245600	1246960	I don't know.
1246960	1248560	Well, let's just let's just be clear.
1248560	1250680	On one point, he represents all black people.
1251440	1257520	I think it was fair when when I was a kid and to.
1259840	1263280	When we would play like tag flashlight tag,
1263800	1267360	kick the can, whatever, when somebody had to be it and we went,
1267360	1271440	we would the kids would gather in a circle and we would go eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
1271880	1274200	And it wasn't to catch a tiger by the toe.
1275560	1277560	It was it was it wasn't tiger.
1277560	1278960	It was the Chevy by the.
1278960	1282560	It was about about half the time it was catch the catch a tiger
1282560	1286440	and about the other half of the time, this is the late 70s, early 80s
1286440	1289280	in the in the in the middle of the Midwest and someone's backyard.
1289520	1293360	There were and there were, you know, there were there were maybe
1293360	1296600	maybe the half the time was when maybe when Billy Peavy from Down the Block,
1296600	1298280	who was black, like, was was playing or not.
1298280	1300040	I can't remember if it was related to that.
1300040	1302400	But it's like I didn't I didn't even know I wasn't.
1303000	1304880	I never pictured like anything.
1305120	1306680	It was just like a word.
1306680	1310520	But it was it was I'm bringing that up
1310520	1315600	because also as late as my like late 20s, early 30s.
1315800	1316720	No, fuck that.
1316720	1322440	I was editing community with Steven Sprung, my very gay editor for community.
1322440	1325320	And I didn't I didn't really I didn't know it was good and bothered.
1325320	1326680	I wasn't processing that.
1326680	1330480	And I kept going like I had this habit would go like I would see an edit.
1330480	1333040	I didn't like and I go, oh, that's fucking gay. Fix that.
1333480	1336360	Like I just I just I like gay.
1337320	1342400	Like like I just meaning dumb, retarded, stupid, bad, like like.
1342720	1348480	And then I like it was it was weeks before and I was just gay, right?
1348480	1353080	I wonder if I wish I wish she's just retarded.
1353080	1355120	I wish she was gay.
1355120	1358320	If she wasn't so retarded, maybe there's a way we could put her on some dates
1358320	1362240	and like like like make her gay so that I could also use her as an out for everything.
1362240	1364880	She'd be like, my sister could be a Swiss army knife.
1372920	1377360	But I was like, like, like, like out of line, you know, like I and it's like, like,
1378560	1380080	God, I'm a writer.
1380080	1384080	So it's like, like the idea of people telling you that something's not funny
1384080	1386600	or something's off limits or you have to censor yourself.
1386600	1389800	It's like, that's the more important enemy all the time.
1390440	1394440	Because then you're in the in the den of what what what evil, you know,
1394440	1396560	you have to guard against those people.
1396560	1402480	And those are the real people that that like like the like the like
1403080	1404960	I'm still convinced of that.
1404960	1408320	But at the same time, I'm like, maybe maybe this is just getting older.
1408320	1410760	Like maybe you just get old and then you get you get bored
1410760	1412800	and then you start getting sensitive or something like that.
1413400	1415440	I don't know what my point is.
1415440	1417480	I don't say fag or gay anymore.
1417480	1420400	And I, you know, I was like.
1422160	1425240	Just saying, like, maybe there's a maybe there's a new thing.
1425240	1427680	Maybe what do we say now? Awesome.
1427680	1430080	Are there any awesome people in the audience?
1430080	1433920	I don't know. I don't know what the maybe is gay people the last frontier.
1433920	1435840	Is there anything left?
1437680	1440720	Are we going to be are we going to be like homogenized after this?
1440720	1442960	Are we going to be like Star Trek?
1442960	1447920	Or I think it's a it's a human impulse to marginalize certain people
1447920	1449320	to to point out differences.
1449320	1452480	I think we're fascinated by we're all insecure.
1452480	1455600	We all have our own kind of needy hang ups.
1455600	1459360	And we all we have a desire to point out anybody that's different.
1459760	1462160	Even the best among us, I think it's it's a it's a weird.
1463080	1466160	Yeah, you know, people worry the slippery slope argument is OK.
1466160	1467760	Well, so we're all going to get along.
1467760	1471600	And then the next thing will be tall people, redheads, people with freckles.
1471600	1475040	I think the big one, I think that that that humanity
1475240	1478600	has a better chance of overcoming racism before sexism.
1478600	1483400	I think I think that men are going to hate women longer than they'll hate other races.
1483400	1486880	I think that I think I think sexism is the maybe the most pervasive
1486880	1488120	and the most ingrained.
1488120	1490000	What was the order again?
1490000	1491200	Black ladies, come on.
1491200	1493240	Hi. Couldn't black man.
1493240	1495400	I can't I can't remember my history now from eighth grade.
1495400	1499040	Black black men could vote in America before women. Right.
1499440	1501200	Was it? Yeah, it was like it was first.
1501200	1504200	It was like, OK, these people are human beings for God's sakes.
1504200	1507000	Like, like, let's give them a say in who's president.
1507000	1510040	Yeah, yeah, I agree. Shut up, Tracy.
1511720	1513920	Get back in the kitchen.
1514560	1516400	I love you.
1519360	1520920	That is that is kind of amazing.
1520920	1523280	It's it's it's it's noteworthy.
1523560	1529560	Men's hatred of women is just like just palpable and so justifiable. No.
1531200	1532680	See, that's not it's not funny.
1532680	1535320	It's not even funny to say it.
1535320	1537440	It's it's it sounds so real women.
1537440	1539760	Women are women walk down the street.
1540320	1541800	They have to deal with that all the time.
1541800	1546360	They feel like they like they that that's something that like nobody
1547000	1550680	it the shit that I hear from women, like you want to reject it.
1550680	1553880	Like, come on, you know, it's not that bad, is it?
1554240	1557560	Like, like when you ever hear like women talk about when they walk down
1557560	1560200	the sidewalk by themselves and then they just like like somebody
1560200	1562640	drives the car by and they say something about the window.
1562640	1564720	They make a noise or a face or something like you.
1564720	1566040	You want it to not be true.
1566040	1568440	Like, come on, this life isn't a cartoon,
1568880	1571440	but I've heard it enough from enough different sources.
1572000	1574440	First three women that told me that I was like, fuck you, you're lying.
1576880	1580160	But now I realize they were heroes.
1580160	1581920	I should write them a letter.
1581920	1585600	No, it sounds like sounds like men are pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty frightening.
1587280	1589000	They are frightening.
1589560	1590560	Sorry.
1592320	1595760	If only there was an empty of women here that could somehow.
1596360	1597640	But no, it's not.
1597640	1599400	You mean a black woman? No.
1602440	1604360	What do you what's an empty of women?
1604360	1606040	Well, I was making the joke.
1606040	1609320	Like, like who's who's here to represent the women in the audience?
1610080	1612320	Because it's a bunch of women is the answer.
1614120	1617560	Adam Goldberg, ladies and gentlemen, Adam Goldberg, start the stage.
1617800	1619720	All right. How's it going?
1619720	1620760	Hi, Adam Goldberg.
1620760	1623320	Those ladies can't live with them.
1623760	1625880	Got to live with the fear of never living with them.
1626160	1628560	Am I right? Yeah. Yeah.
1628560	1629320	Let's hear it for him.
1629320	1631400	I don't go everybody. Thank you, Adam. Thank you.
1632560	1633240	He's still here.
1633240	1636600	I just thought that doesn't that was called an outro.
1638840	1640960	Man, you're treating me like Aaron up here.
1641800	1644640	I think it's amazing for Jeff to come out and say, you know, women,
1645000	1646680	women are just unfairly hated.
1646680	1648840	Your girlfriend's bad at D&D.
1648840	1651560	I know I've only played it three times, but I play it twice.
1651560	1653720	And she's not making Aaron the empty of women.
1653720	1656760	I just don't like the thing that she did that last night.
1656760	1659840	The thing that she did, the irony is that the thing that she does
1659840	1662440	that upsets you is calling you gay.
1662440	1666560	So we've gotten to the spiral and cat's asshole of prejudice
1666560	1670280	about prejudice, leading to prejudice about fantasy prejudice.
1670960	1672040	This is interesting.
1672040	1674280	It's literally fantastic racism.
1676760	1680440	Fine. All right, Adam, that's it.
1680440	1682440	You got to do it. Fair enough. Fair enough.
1682440	1686960	I just I just want to absolve the show of this aura of, you know,
1686960	1691280	it's hard to be mean to feel for other people who have different circumstances
1691280	1694200	because, you know, it's hard to because they I don't want to believe it,
1694200	1695400	but I guess I do.
1695400	1698360	I'm heroic saviors of my fucking face.
1698680	1700200	Dan Harmon, what else?
1700200	1701200	What mean of me?
1701200	1703920	That's that's that clearly worked in this side of the room,
1703920	1705400	but it's too mean of me.
1705400	1708040	What what else is going on?
1709880	1713120	I don't know, made a YouTube video that might be big, might not.
1715280	1718240	And that's not what I'm not going to mention it because it's not about promotion.
1718240	1723840	But, you know, I had a job in because promotion would be tacky and crass.
1723840	1727440	Like we want to maintain a baseline of integrity here.
1727480	1730360	I'm the I'm the product and I'm unsellable.
1730360	1733200	God, I was errant so much right now.
1734040	1736920	Well, what what about what about race, Adam?
1736920	1738040	What do you think about race?
1738040	1741120	I think there are plenty of them and there's just going to be more.
1742960	1745440	Wait, wait. He's like, wait, wait, wait.
1745440	1747760	What do you know that I don't know?
1747760	1749160	They're making new races.
1749160	1751400	Have you have you have you been to Pinkberry lately?
1751400	1754320	I haven't. No, they'll swirl the flavors for you.
1756800	1758360	Pinkberry is making new races.
1758360	1759880	Pink, Pinkberry is making.
1759880	1762600	It's just they got a green tea chocolate chip.
1762600	1765160	Green tea chocolate chip Filipino. Yeah.
1766480	1770080	But I'm not just to be the devil's advocate because I got nothing.
1770120	1771360	Of course not to talk about it.
1771360	1773320	Don't work for the devil, but go on.
1773320	1775800	But isn't there going to be less races as we go on?
1775840	1779080	That's that's true. That's another another take on it. But
1781360	1784840	it's been highly theorized that humanity will eventually get to the point
1784840	1788200	where once you can get all your brain data backed up,
1788800	1790440	you can have whatever body you like.
1790440	1791960	You can have. Well, that's for sure.
1791960	1794160	Yeah. Ten years from now, humanism.
1794160	1797240	That's the end. The end of racism won't end until we're not,
1797600	1800160	you know, related to the body we're born in.
1800320	1801680	That's going to be the end of everything.
1801680	1803200	That's going to be like 15 years from now.
1803200	1806760	You're going to be able to buy the equivalent of a video game
1807040	1810440	and you're going to get to just go into your office and close the door
1810760	1813480	and and type in some variables.
1813480	1817360	And you could be a female dog getting fucked by an octopus.
1818840	1821280	Like, and then just experience what that's like.
1821280	1824240	And then and then end the program and never tell anybody about it.
1826400	1829720	Like, so how is that going to like, like, like, like, what then?
1829720	1831360	Then what's marriage?
1831360	1834560	Like, what's the what's the priest supposed to say then?
1835320	1839360	Like, well, I now I now pronounce you like, I now pronounce you two people
1839360	1842040	who who are kind of points of departure.
1842040	1844400	Yeah. You may kiss whatever.
1844400	1846680	And whoever pronounce you any and outie.
1847600	1850760	The fact society will collapse when we can fuck whoever we want,
1850760	1852080	whenever we want.
1852080	1855600	Jeff, you know that the future of our society is being being the octopus
1855600	1858160	or being the dog. It's that's going to be the Democrats and the Republican.
1858880	1861080	You're preaching to the choir, baby.
1862040	1865440	I just I just I think we need to answer a few more questions.
1865440	1867400	We being you, this is this is harm in town.
1867400	1870400	And Adam, we got an election coming up, Adam.
1870400	1872360	I don't know if you're aware of this.
1872360	1875040	Oh, boy. We got a big election coming up.
1875040	1877320	It's right around the corner. Who do you like?
1877320	1879080	This is this is a good one because
1881720	1884920	I campaigned for John Edwards in 2007.
1884920	1887160	Yeah. He's not going to get it.
1887160	1888320	Oh, he's not going to get it.
1888320	1890600	Well, you say you can't pay for it. That's a long shot.
1890600	1895040	He cheated on a woman with cancer, which is one of the life sublime glories.
1895240	1899280	It's the VR experience of the future is you get to be the kind of person
1899280	1902720	who's down with. So I was up in New Hampshire.
1902720	1905720	The thought ends itself.
1905720	1907360	You're you're a participant in that.
1907360	1912480	And God, the fact that I had to pay my own train ticket up to New Hampshire.
1912480	1913880	Got a ring on some doors.
1913880	1917160	And the thing about New Hampshire, everyone seems to own a dog there.
1917520	1919840	I don't know. That's my experience.
1919840	1920760	That person agrees.
1920760	1924160	But as a person of the Jewish persuasion.
1927000	1928280	Thank you. I'm sorry.
1928280	1929840	We don't mean to interrupt you.
1929840	1931160	Jewish people are horrified.
1931160	1932640	Oh, we're listening. We're listening.
1933120	1934440	This one. I know. I know.
1934440	1936080	I know. You have to drink to the get through this.
1936080	1939960	I've been so Jewish people terrified of dogs.
1940080	1942000	Everyone in New Hampshire owns a dog.
1942000	1944760	You can see that this is that was like, oh, knock, knock.
1944800	1945480	Oh, God.
1947720	1950760	Steal yourself, Adam. Political activism is its own reward.
1952040	1953160	Every single house.
1953160	1956680	This has become like a star search audition video.
1958800	1960960	That might as well be a hairbrush in your hands.
1960960	1964200	Oh, God. That's the point of my story.
1964280	1967160	So so Romney, you're saying. Oh, of course.
1967160	1969560	Whichever one is against dog ownership.
1970480	1974720	Freedom, freedom from for if you love your dog, you will let it free.
1975040	1977280	There's nothing. You're not helping it.
1977280	1979280	You're not. That's that's digging a hole.
1979280	1980880	But I'll gladly dig it.
1980880	1982480	All right. Dig it.
1982480	1984720	OK, just bring up, just bring up Steve if he's here.
1984840	1986440	Now, yeah, Adam Goldberg, everybody.
1986440	1988400	Let's let's let's say goodnight to him and.
1990960	1993320	Let's let's let's let's keep going with this momentum.
1993720	1995920	Hey, BJ, you want to come up here? It was BJ.
1995920	1998360	BJ's the guy that I arm wrestled that one night.
1998360	2001200	You probably you're not as eager as Adam, but I thought I'd pull you up.
2004760	2007960	I like I like this idea that we have a family starting to grow.
2011440	2014680	Dan, do we owe it to our podcast listeners to describe
2016960	2019920	in penetrating detail exactly?
2020720	2023240	He does stand up, please, so I can get a good look at you.
2023640	2025800	BJ, for those of you don't know,
2027800	2029920	he won the great race, the amazing race.
2029920	2032360	What was it called? Amazing race.
2033320	2035400	He won he won a million clams for a race.
2035400	2036960	He won and he's got a beard.
2036960	2039880	He has a what is it? Salmon coral?
2039880	2041280	What's that scarf? What do you call that?
2041280	2043240	Is that kind of a coral?
2043240	2044640	Yeah, kind of a coral scarf.
2044640	2046080	It's a silk scarf.
2046080	2050320	He's got a he's got a red flannel plaid
2052040	2055480	robe on, and then he's got a mix matched black and white
2055480	2058000	kind of plaid trousers like pajamas.
2058240	2059520	He's in pajamas.
2059520	2061920	He's in pajamas. He's pouring vodka into a coke can right now.
2064040	2067400	He's wearing a sea foam crux.
2068240	2070640	See, see foam green. Is that powder?
2071600	2075680	Different color. I yeah, one is green, one is light blue.
2075920	2079440	Because God forbid you would be a conformist in any way.
2080680	2083480	It's a Truman Capote after getting hit by a train.
2085360	2088240	But but non-lethally, like you get bounced off of the bounced
2088240	2090640	into the train yard and put himself back together.
2090640	2092800	Oh, God, what happened?
2092800	2094600	He's pulled up one of his trouser legs
2094600	2097440	and to reveal a pretty crude bandage.
2099240	2100520	You're wounded.
2100520	2102880	BJ, what the hell happened to you?
2102880	2104840	I fell down.
2106040	2108440	Do you care to elaborate?
2108560	2112040	I was going really fast.
2114320	2115880	Thanks. Thank you.

2144600	2145920	I'm sorry. Have you been here before?
2145920	2147760	No, I have not. Oh, OK.
2147760	2148520	I don't know.
2148520	2150480	There's probably don't don't be offended if you're
2150480	2152360	if you're a third black person and you're somewhere,
2152360	2154360	I can't see you and you're like, what am I chopped liver?
2154360	2156160	I just want to see who the other black guy was.
2156160	2159600	Oh, and he is and he always sits in the front row
2159600	2164240	and he's he's he's he's often been the lightning rod of my white guilt.
2164240	2168280	Dan, I don't want to send you into a spiral of a chaotic mania,
2168280	2170120	but we have a black woman in the audience tonight.
2170120	2171920	Oh, no. Yeah, it's like doubling down.
2171920	2174720	Yeah, it's a crazy like like how can I ever relate
2174720	2177480	to anything that you ever experienced?
2177480	2179720	We'll have you up in a minute.
2179720	2182120	Let's ease into it with a black gentleman first of all.
2182120	2185120	Yeah. And let's also buffer it with like, let's let's bring up
2185120	2188160	like an Indian guy in between, I don't know, or just a carpenter
2188160	2189840	like I can not so that it's not like a race.
2189840	2192480	Do you have any mini Kanju or any Arapaho in here tonight?
2193480	2194920	No, no, go ahead.
2194920	2200280	All right. So, Chris, do you have if there's anything you want to say
2200280	2202720	or else we can ask you questions? I don't know.
2202720	2205120	I mean, you can ask me whatever. OK.
2205120	2207440	Well, what is a student?
2207440	2210480	No, I am an assistant at a production company.
2210480	2211880	It's not really stupid.
2211880	2213480	No, it's nothing. There's nothing.
2213480	2215760	I mean, we didn't break, you know, it's not.
2215760	2218000	It's not that kind of you don't have to plug anything.
2218000	2221160	You know, I know. Oh, well,
2221240	2223760	can you tell us what kind of production that you're working on?
2225720	2226880	It's a TV show.
2226880	2230720	I don't really like a reality show or a sitcom or leverage on TNT.
2231640	2234160	Is that is that Timothy? Yeah, Timothy Hutton.
2234160	2237520	Timothy Hutton from from from the from the dark side.

2241480	2244080	The Stephen King story.
2244080	2246840	Dark side. Dark.
2246840	2250360	No, no, no, it was no, I wasn't mad at you.

2256680	2259240	And I emerge victorious.
2259240	2261520	Sorry, Chris.
2261520	2264000	This is Timothy Hutton, a producer on that show.
2264000	2267720	Um, no, he's just like the main talent.
2267720	2269120	Yeah, he swings a big dick.
2269120	2272320	He comes he comes through the office and he goes, well, fuck through this away.
2272320	2274760	Well, I mean, I don't really understand why, but whatever.
2275360	2281920	Oh, he was an ordinary people.
2282200	2283040	What are you doing in the show?
2283040	2284040	You are Piazza.
2284040	2287640	I work for the COO of the production company,
2288000	2289840	so I don't really like work for the show show.
2289840	2293000	All right. Oh, so you're on payroll with the with like the studio,
2293040	2294520	like a little production pod.
2294520	2296440	Yeah. Dean Devlin's company.
2296440	2299240	Oh, Dean Devlin.
2299240	2301080	He did Independence Day. No one knows who the.
2301080	2303960	I had a meeting with Dean Devlin.
2303960	2306720	We made shop back in our back in our heyday.
2306760	2308800	We had a meeting with him and Roland Emmerich.
2308800	2313080	And he he said that they were excited about Godzilla
2313080	2316640	because they took this thing that was cheesy and they turned into something awesome.
2321120	2322920	That they did.
2322920	2325400	And are you an aspiring filmmaker?
2326560	2329920	No, actually, it was I kind of just moved out of L.A.
2329920	2332800	on a whim and I just needed something to do.
2332800	2335040	So I worked at a production company. Fucking.
2335040	2336320	I'm moving away soon.
2336320	2338320	Oh, really? You've had enough.
2338320	2340080	Yeah, I mean, I've been here for like three years.
2340080	2342400	So that Timothy Hedden's really getting under your skin, huh?
2344640	2347400	You've had enough of that fucking asshole.
2347400	2349840	I just had sex, whatever.
2350920	2352800	Wait, but this is now you've got me curious
2352800	2354920	because there's people, the young people, they come to L.A.
2354920	2357040	They're they're they're hungry and they want something.
2357040	2360000	If you're moving away, what's the aspiration?
2360000	2362520	Is there something I'm moving to Peru?
2362880	2364440	To teach English.
2364440	2366880	Are you just? Oh, OK, OK.
2366880	2368880	I was about to say, are you just like a trust fund kid?
2368880	2370520	You've already got even a little.
2370520	2374360	So you're you're but you're you're like a you're like a kind of a hippie.
2374360	2377320	Like, I'm groovy, a drug or two.
2379400	2381680	And you're just kind of you're can I ask how old you are?
2381680	2383440	Are you twenty five? Yeah. OK.
2383440	2384800	Are you going to go to Peru and do that?
2384800	2386600	It was called ayahuasca or ayahuasca?
2386600	2389800	Oh, God, yes. Oh, really?
2389800	2390880	Are you really going to do it?
2390880	2395440	Yeah, like, that's my mission to find a shaman in Amazon for us,
2395440	2397360	like 200 miles away from civilization.
2397360	2400920	You get really fucked up and I go teach English.
2400920	2403520	I'd probably be better at it.
2403520	2407520	The first English phrase they all your students learn is, oh, look at my hands.
2410720	2414120	Jaguar is is asking me for a job interview.
2415840	2417440	The ayahuasca is the thing from that.
2417440	2419520	Well, this isn't going to help you from altered states.
2419520	2422760	The William Hurt movie, you guys are whatever.
2422760	2424800	It's it's Rob.
2426680	2428680	Rob's coming up next.
2429680	2433880	You drink, you drink this like it's made out of like herbs and root.
2433920	2436720	And they just crushed it up and make a drink out of it.
2436720	2439920	You go to the Amazon or this shaman like puts it down your gullet
2439920	2442440	and then you freak out and you barf your barf for a while.
2442440	2443400	Right. Don't you? Don't you?
2443400	2446760	You barf and have you done it before and just do everything?
2446760	2449040	Have you done it before? No, I know people who have done it. Right.
2449040	2451360	Like, yeah. So how primary is that?
2451360	2453640	Is that the primary thing you're going down there for?
2453640	2455200	No, no, not even a little bit.
2455200	2457200	Like, that's not my first goal.
2457200	2459240	First goal is to go out there and teach English.
2459240	2460840	OK, that's just a side mission.
2460840	2461800	How do you speak Spanish?
2461800	2464480	Do you speak Spanish? Well, no, but I speak French and Creole,
2464480	2467200	so it won't be hard to learn it.
2467200	2469040	I'll take your word for it.
2469040	2470720	What? I say I'm going to do it as I learn it.
2470720	2471680	That's awesome.

2481320	2484320	in the world. I don't know.
2484320	2486200	It's a it's a new thing.
2486200	2487880	They're reacting to Generation X.
2487880	2489400	They're like, why did you why?
2489400	2490760	Why did why? Why weezer?
2490760	2494240	Why? Why not? Why not?

2496280	2498640	What would be a I mean, I mean,

2502280	2503280	Yeah.
2503680	2506680	I don't ask black people time travel.
2514200	2518200	Just as a rule, I seriously don't like it because we can't go back.
2519360	2521000	Please let that be the title of the episode.
2521000	2522440	Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that's great.
2522440	2523680	That's the title of this episode.

2538680	2540320	Thank you, Chris. That was very nice.
2540320	2542480	Thank you for being a sport.
2545560	2549640	All right. Let's let's let's go to a black female.
2549680	2551000	Do you want to come up?
2551600	2552600	What's your name?
2555160	2557800	Char Char star star star.
2557840	2558640	Oh, she has a star.
2558640	2561240	She's wearing a star on her hair.
2562160	2564800	Star star with two hours, maybe.
2565360	2568760	No, just just spelled like the celestial body.
2568880	2572400	That's my my whole name, star lean, but I just go by star.
2572400	2574720	Nice. Just short for star lean.
2574720	2575920	That's awesome.
2575920	2577840	Is that star glow in the dark when you have on your head?
2577840	2580640	No, it's just it's like a Scott Pilgrim thing.
2581240	2583720	Like I'm just a big nerd. Sorry.
2584520	2585800	Are you from L.A.?
2585800	2587800	No, I'm originally from Miami.
2587800	2589200	But I mean, are you living in L.A. now?
2589200	2591000	Oh, yeah, yeah. North Hollywood.
2591000	2592000	How long have you been here?
2592000	2595000	About two and a half years.
2595040	2596640	What are your dreams and ambitions?
2596640	2601680	I would like to be a cartoonist and print books and stuff like that.
2601680	2603000	I just have a webcomic now.
2603000	2605200	So it's what's it called? Let's plug it.
2605200	2608680	Oh, candy candy comics dot com with an eye.
2608720	2609840	Candy with an eye.
2609840	2611240	Candy comics with an eye.
2611240	2613840	Yeah, it's short for candy up here.
2617080	2617720	All right.
2617720	2619280	So you want to be a cartoonist?
2619280	2620560	You're making it happen for yourself.
2620560	2621760	You're not a quitter like Chris.
2621760	2627200	You're not going to fling yourself off into ice fishing.
2627200	2630000	Go get high with a show.
2630000	2633840	That's pretty awesome, though, like no, no, he's he's more activated than us.
2633840	2635280	Far more noble to go teach.
2635280	2636000	You're like me.
2636000	2639200	You're going to stay here and you're going to you proclaim to God
2639200	2643680	that you would rather die of starvation while you do what you do.
2643680	2645240	And then 15 years from now, pretty much.
2645240	2648240	Yeah. Well, God help you star. Yeah.
2648240	2652080	Oh, you start twenty nine.
2652080	2653360	Twenty nine. You look so young.
2653360	2654600	You look like twenty two.
2654600	2659400	I moisturize a lot just naturally.
2659400	2663400	You know, my products are just you're like, well, she's a great sloth.
2663680	2666080	Well, you don't look ashy. You have to. You have to.
2666720	2668720	You get ashy. Yeah. Yeah.
2668720	2670480	I remember that.
2670480	2672720	I know. I know. I know about that culture.
2672720	2674040	I know what ashy means.
2674040	2677280	I went to predominantly black grade schools and middle schools, Jeff.
2677600	2680920	I was surrounded by people constantly struggling with ashyness.
2682520	2685320	You're a real hero. Yeah.
2685320	2687320	Well, I didn't know you'd been through so much struggle.
2687320	2691320	I I dwelt among them, Jeff.
2691320	2693600	I can't I'm sort of like a man called horse.
2695240	2699080	I was 80s references that don't I'm already out on a limb
2699320	2703320	being racist, ironically, and then I and then I'm busting out my Tron references.
2703320	2705840	And I was like, oh, it's like
2706280	2708800	there's no difference between the show and Christmas with your uncle.
2709680	2713720	It's just like, it's like you just, well, I'm sorry.
2713720	2716760	There's a difference. Ten dollars.
2717560	2719600	Like at least your uncle gives you socks.
2719600	2721480	Yeah. Oh, yeah. Your uncle gives you $10.
2721480	2723360	I'm so sorry, you guys.
2723360	2727520	You're all there's a pair of socks waiting for each of you by the by the She-Hulk section
2729120	2730360	on your way out. All right, star.
2730360	2733200	Well, let's see. Is it what is there anything on your mind?
2733200	2735320	You got it. You got an open pulpit here.
2735320	2738760	Oh, I just like hearing you talk. I don't really.
2738800	2739800	Yeah, I've heard that before.
2739800	2741920	Like people say, you know what?
2741920	2743600	Because sometimes the show's going bad.
2743600	2745080	I go like, ah, this show sucks.
2745080	2747560	And then people go, yeah, but, you know, at a certain point,
2747560	2749320	people just like to listen to you talk.
2749320	2752440	Yeah, like for whatever reason, all your ramblings end up
2752600	2756240	coming back to some type of like life affirming point.
2756560	2759120	Yeah. And I just I'm like, I don't know.
2759120	2763800	Somehow listening to you worry about everything makes me feel like comforted.
2763800	2766160	Like, OK, I'm not the only one that worries.
2766400	2767520	You know what I think it is?
2767520	2769240	I'm the least qualified to say it.
2769240	2774440	I feel like if I were not me, the thing that would comfort me about listening to me
2776560	2782080	would be like watching me thrash and flail so, so hard.
2782160	2786880	Like, like, and and and actually like be like, it's like, well, if they're
2787120	2790800	if they're if things were that bad, he would have knocked into something
2790800	2793200	by now that would really bum me the fuck out.
2793200	2796400	But really, it's I'm so pathetic.
2797040	2800720	I just kind of like it's like it's like if you if you if you take acid,
2800720	2803960	like, I don't know if you're like Chris, if you like like, you know, like a big drug
2803960	2809320	head, but like when I was Chris's age, like, you know, Chris, we're worried about you.
2809320	2812320	Take you take mushrooms, you take acid.
2812320	2814120	And there's such a thing as a bad trip.
2814120	2816320	You know, people are scared about a bad trip.
2816880	2821600	And then there's this idea that worrying about a bad trip can give you a bad trip.
2821920	2825120	So what happens is this fence goes up where you go like, no,
2825120	2826160	I don't want to talk about it.
2826160	2830440	It's very similar to any kind of like, like, like anything,
2830440	2832920	like just always that's the human mind at work.
2832920	2836720	We build these fences up because it's often very healthy of us
2836720	2839160	to sequester ourselves and limit ourselves.
2839160	2842800	So like, like humans under duress, you pay, put this on your tongue
2842800	2845480	and you're going to see spots and you're going to the owls might talk to you.
2845640	2849520	Also, you may fucking freak out and you think that the earth is opening up
2849520	2851840	and a hand made of logs is dragging you down.
2853200	2856120	But but but just keep eating oranges and that won't happen.
2856120	2858000	And like, don't talk about it.
2858000	2859080	You're going to make it happen, bro.
2859080	2860320	You're going to make it happen.
2860320	2864120	I I I try as hard as I can to make it happen.
2864120	2865160	And it doesn't happen.
2865160	2866560	And I think that's uplifting.
2866560	2871320	Maybe that's my personal theory is why people would possibly be willing
2871320	2875000	to tolerate me talking because they go, well, if you can't destroy the earth
2875000	2879000	with your mouth, then maybe it has some sturdiness to it.
2879000	2880600	Maybe things aren't that bad.
2880600	2882200	Do you agree with that star?
2882200	2883800	Yes, I do.
2884800	2887600	Star star, ladies and gentlemen.
2887600	2890080	Star, how lovely.
2890760	2891680	All right.
2891680	2895400	I'm starting to feel I think I might be the next Paula Poundstone.
2895800	2900680	Yeah, yeah, you're you're in Dick Cavett country right now.
2900680	2901200	This is nice.
2901200	2902400	Who's your Asian guy?
2902400	2902840	Come up.
2902840	2910960	Hey, what's your name, sir?
2910960	2912400	Jason Jason, everybody.
2912400	2915080	Welcome, Jason, to the stage.
2915080	2916720	All right, what's going on, Jason?
2916720	2918720	Jason, what's what are Asian people thinking?
2921200	2924240	So why why are Asian people second best to you?
2925240	2926040	Oh, yeah.
2926040	2926800	Oh, yeah. Yeah.
2926800	2927800	You take that to heart.
2927800	2930560	Make a make a pro make a comparison.
2930800	2935280	Well, because Asian to me, in my mind, Asian is half of the earth.
2935280	2938720	And in fact, the half of the earth that is like teeming with people.
2938720	2939960	So more than half of the earth.
2939960	2944600	But like it just means Eastern because we've gotten so tied up and like,
2944840	2950000	well, I don't want to be racist by ordering a Korean beer in a Chinese restaurant.
2950200	2953840	So we've started to you know, and the most racist thing you could ever do
2953840	2957440	is confuse a Chinese person for a Vietnamese person, et cetera.
2957640	2962200	So I'm pretty convinced that white people at one point decided, OK, Asian, let's go.
2963400	2968880	You used to be oriental like and then and then we rightfully decided like,
2968880	2971080	well, that sounds a little awkward and weird.
2971080	2973080	What is it? What is your heritage?
2973080	2975080	Korean, Korean.
2975080	2976520	Anyways, that's the answer.
2976520	2978560	It's like, I don't know, black's more specific, man.
2978560	2982160	Asian, come on. Daima doesn't.
2983080	2987000	I mean, to the point where, you know, there's some Asian countries that are like,
2987000	2989200	you you you have to have just one baby.
2989200	2990720	There's too many Asian people.
2990720	2992080	That's what they're saying.
2992080	2994640	Don't take it. The Asian people are saying it.
2994640	2996400	I didn't say it.
2997680	2999960	Jason, you're more than welcome here.
2999960	3002120	Just saying like, I read the news.
3002400	3004680	I don't read the news.
3004680	3005800	I don't read the news.
3005800	3010560	I get the news about Chinese people from my mother in 1983.
3010640	3012680	Where did you grow up, Jason?
3012680	3014360	What's that? Where did you grow up here?
3014360	3015120	You know, I yeah.
3015120	3016560	Where'd you go to school?
3016560	3018840	In the valley in North Hollywood and Burbank.
3018840	3020400	Oh, cool. Yeah.
3020400	3022280	Not that exciting.
3022280	3024120	No, nobody. Nobody's that exciting.
3024120	3025960	I bring in people because I'm not exciting.
3025960	3027680	Who care? You know, what's the who knows?
3029960	3031920	Hmm. What are you what are you doing?
3032520	3034920	What are your dreams? Aspirations.
3036320	3038200	I am living them already.
3038200	3040240	You live living them already. I don't.
3042920	3043760	Can we ask?
3043760	3045840	Can we can we pray?
3045840	3048040	Well, I work in music.
3048040	3050200	So I wanted to do since I was a kid.
3050200	3051560	So it worked out well enough.
3051560	3054440	What do you do? Are you a musician or do you know?
3054440	3057560	I work with a lot of musicians and also work for
3058480	3060880	BMG, do a lot of stuff for them.
3060880	3063880	An engineer or are you just?
3063880	3066680	Well, right now I'm doing royalty stuff.
3066680	3070560	But yeah, you like music that much that just being close to it
3070560	3073000	in that capacity is exciting for you.
3073000	3075400	Yeah, for money thing, I'm just doing
3075400	3078120	with the big companies, but also working with artists.
3078120	3080200	So I do that on the side.
3080200	3082920	Do you feel that Dan Harmon has been fair to the Asians
3082920	3084920	at Harmon town? Do you feel you feel represented
3084920	3087120	or do you feel there's a lack of Asian representation?
3087120	3088640	I think there's been favoritism.
3091640	3094760	But you to a large extent,
3094760	3098080	but you know, how are Asian people with time travel questions?
3098080	3105920	I think it depends on the country and the time.
3105920	3108880	OK, it's it's it's Burma.
3111200	3116520	1822. I think he's got something.
3117280	3119040	I know. I think Asians are cool with Burma.
3123040	3127640	I don't I haven't read anything about Asians versus Burmese.
3127760	3129880	Yeah, yeah, I haven't read any problems.
3129880	3131520	All right. You hear that 1822 Burma?
3131520	3133520	That's a that's a badge you can put on your website.
3133520	3134800	You're off the hook, Burma.
3134800	3136640	They get a pass.
3137720	3143480	What I say your your parents are they how how how how many generations deep
3143480	3146720	since we know since you're ethnically Asian,
3146720	3149280	that at some point in your lineage, someone
3151920	3154200	came over after a Mayflower thing.
3154560	3155760	That's all I know.
3155760	3157080	How many were you?
3157080	3158640	Are you parents, America?
3158640	3159640	Were they born American?
3159640	3164640	Were your grandparents moved here and your parents or your grandparents?
3164640	3168920	My parents. OK, so your second generation Korean, that's America.
3168920	3170160	I don't know how those things work.
3170160	3171760	Yeah, so I think that's what that means.
3171760	3174640	Second generation because your parents were immigrants, right?
3175200	3176480	Am I getting this right?
3176480	3177880	I feel like Archie Bunker.
3177880	3179240	He's first generation American.
3179240	3181520	Oh, oh, first generation Korean-American.
3181560	3182520	There you go. So what?
3182520	3185760	So his parents are zero, yeah, because they're they're Korean.
3189400	3190320	Interesting.
3191520	3193320	This is a great night at home in town.
3193320	3194440	You know, I need to know this stuff.
3194440	3195560	I'm going to start my own town.
3195560	3198320	I need to know what to say to the Korean people as they join the town.
3198520	3200920	You're zero.
3200920	3202920	Welcome aboard.
3203920	3208760	So this. So, OK, this is good because I like your parents there.
3209080	3211320	So English is a second language for them.
3211320	3213640	Yeah. So and they are they.
3214160	3216360	You call them pretty traditional.
3216360	3217920	I mean, compared to you, Shirley.
3217920	3220480	Yeah. All right. So all right.
3220480	3223440	Your mom and dad's thoughts about black people.
3226560	3228840	This is because this is what I find fascinating.
3229080	3233800	Like, like, what what's, you know, like, I'm up on Mount Olympus.
3233800	3238040	You know, I'm eating, drinking my Diet Coke and watching everybody fight it out.
3238040	3240000	Like, what's what are the like?
3240000	3243920	But you get these glimpses of like, oh, Koreans are the Korean shop owners
3243920	3245920	like, like so racist against the black guy.
3245920	3248160	You see it in a movie and you go like, what's going on?
3248160	3250240	What? Why aren't you guys all just burning down the White House?
3251120	3253800	Why aren't you just mad because you're all poor?
3253840	3256000	And the answer is fucking hegemony.
3256000	3260360	I'm like, like, like white people are genius manipulators.
3260360	3263520	So we've taken over the earth.
3263520	3266080	So I want to know what your mom and dad like,
3266080	3268440	what the weird racist shit they say in the living room.
3270800	3271840	About black people.
3271840	3273160	Also, what are their names?
3273160	3275280	First of all, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
3277280	3279120	They don't say anything racist.
3279120	3283880	Oh, see, we're just trying to get the vote based on what happened between Koreans.
3283880	3285640	And no, no, no, no, I'm fine.
3285640	3286560	I'm doing my thing.
3286560	3289800	I'm flailing around and proving that the world's not that bad. See?
3291120	3293680	See, you just get the kick every rock over.
3293680	3295040	There's not a scorpion under it.
3295040	3296880	There's nothing that thing's going wrong.
3296880	3298280	Do you ever go to Korea? Have you been there?
3298280	3299880	Yeah. Do you enjoy it there?
3300720	3302120	It's north or south, by the way.
3302120	3302720	South one?
3302720	3303800	That's important.
3303800	3304480	South.
3304480	3305120	South, yeah.
3305120	3306760	OK, those are good guys?
3306760	3307280	Yeah.
3310880	3311400	Good guys.
3311400	3312000	Those are the good guys.
3312000	3312520	Yeah.
3317520	3318360	All right, what else?
3318360	3318840	What else?
3318840	3319680	What's going on?
3322560	3327520	This is your last chance to ask a first generation Korean something.
3328680	3329920	Don't waste it, Dan.
3330520	3331280	Um...
3334000	3334640	Breaking Bad?
3334640	3335600	What do you think about Breaking Bad?
3336800	3337600	Like Breaking Bad?
3338440	3339160	Pretty great.
3339160	3340120	All right. Yeah.
3340120	3342920	So you're kind of like just like an American person.
3342920	3344160	I am. Yeah.
3344160	3346000	I am more American.
3346000	3347280	Pretty whitewashed.
3347280	3350440	Yeah, it's all it's almost like race is an artificial construct.
3350440	3350840	Yeah.
3350840	3351920	Boring.
3352920	3353520	All right.
3353520	3355000	It's Jason, everybody.
3355000	3355880	Jason.
3356240	3357120	Thank you, Jason.
3358720	3359320	May I make a...
3359320	3361000	I didn't mean you were boring.
3361000	3362200	May I make a suggestion?
3362200	3362920	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3363920	3367080	Keep going with the racial census of Hormontown.
3367400	3368600	Get a Hispanic up here.
3368600	3369640	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3370440	3372360	Yes, that's very important, actually.
3372360	3373320	And I'll tell you why.
3373320	3375000	Big failing on community.
3375000	3379960	We even had Ken Jeong, who's Korean, but who apparently
3379960	3382200	we ended up playing a Chinese character.
3382200	3383800	That was always a point of contention.
3383800	3387000	Then Danny Pudi, who was Indian, was playing a guy in the script
3387000	3388920	who was scripted as Palestinian.
3388920	3390520	That was a point of contention.
3390520	3394280	But there was basically no Latino people.
3394280	3396720	Latina, Latin people.
3396720	3398120	I thought Starbirds was Latino.
3399640	3400720	This is closer again.
3400720	3404360	All right. Who's who's who's going to represent the Latin America?
3404680	3405640	Here we go. All right.
3405640	3406240	Here we go.
3410080	3411120	What's your name, ma'am?
3411120	3413080	Piper. Piper.
3413080	3414080	Ay, ay, ay.
3419480	3420360	We did have Juliet.
3420360	3422160	I remember when she was in town, she came up.
3422160	3424280	She was she's she's full blown Mexican.
3424280	3428480	She's actually living in Mexico trying to get a job up here, too.
3428480	3429840	She's also an animator, too, right?
3429840	3430760	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3430760	3432800	Piper, what do you do?
3432800	3433960	I work in health care.
3439560	3442280	Well, I can be specific and say health care finance,
3442280	3445160	but that's a little bit more boring than just health care.
3445520	3447160	But it's it really is so boring.
3447160	3450600	It's fascinating to to to people who are sick and tired of hearing
3450600	3452800	about actors and headshots and scripts and stuff.
3453440	3454560	What is it like?
3454560	3456640	Like, like some health care is something you hear.
3456640	3458880	It just to me, it just bounces off of my head.
3459480	3461680	We're doing political debates right now.
3461920	3465600	We're talking about HMOs and hedge nuns and
3467240	3468400	the fucking hedging out.
3468400	3471640	But I don't know what the hell Medicare.
3471800	3473200	I don't know what any of that means.
3473200	3474680	I don't expect you to explain it to me.
3474680	3476760	What is your what is your heritage?
3476760	3478880	Where are your ancestors from?
3478880	3480000	I'm Puerto Rican.
3480000	3482720	I'm Puerto Rican. Yeah, I want to go home.
3485240	3486120	Are you going to take that?
3488440	3491800	I mean, I'm I'm only you don't even.
3492680	3494200	So right.
3494200	3496800	But wait, did you grow up in a bilingual household? Yes.
3497040	3500080	Did you. So how did you do in English classes in school?
3500080	3502160	Like, like writing essays and stuff?
3502160	3503600	Pretty well. Yeah.
3503600	3507520	I said there's a ex-girlfriend of mine was an English teacher
3507520	3509320	and in Los Angeles.
3509320	3513520	And there's a phenomenon where like very, very bright kids
3513520	3517040	who grew up in bilingual households, which is which is where L.A.
3517040	3518320	is teeming with that.
3518320	3519560	These are genius kids.
3519560	3522160	I mean, how many I don't speak two languages with these kids.
3522160	3526560	Like, you know, regardless of their IQ, they grow up in these households
3526560	3529280	where you're bouncing back and forth between Spanish and English.
3529760	3533080	For instance, and it's it
3533800	3538600	apparently it cause it's they suffer in the English grades
3538600	3541040	because they don't actually like they don't get to buckle down
3541040	3543240	and be Frasier at English.
3543240	3547320	They they're more acrobatic, which is a talent unto itself
3547320	3549440	that should be more valuable than it is.
3549440	3551640	But anyways, I was just curious about that.
3551640	3556440	Well, I mean, my mother grew up in the States, so it's not like
3556600	3562680	I just mainly got yelled at in Spanish or, you know, like any.
3562720	3564080	Do you speak Spanish?
3564080	3565960	I can read it and write it, but I don't speak it.
3565960	3568440	Well, you can say put that down.
3568440	3570600	You're grounded and clean your room.
3570800	3571800	You're not good enough.
3571800	3574440	You know, average things that every Hispanic mom says.
3574920	3578520	Is there anyone who feels they're more Hispanic than you probably are?
3578840	3580080	You probably know.
3580080	3581520	Well, I see silence.
3581520	3583880	You win the Thunderdome. You're fine.
3583880	3585440	I thought it'd be interesting if somebody came up
3585440	3588480	and like tried to knock your hat off the.
3588960	3590920	All right. Well, what do we what do we ask?
3590920	3592840	What do we ask, Piper?
3597400	3599720	What do you think of my writing?
3599720	3603800	You know, I think you're a genius,
3603800	3605720	which I'm not just saying to kiss your ass.
3605720	3608880	It's interesting. But I find it interesting.
3608880	3612360	I was I was told not to respond to any text tonight
3612360	3615080	because I'm with my hero and didn't want to get heckled.
3616160	3620040	Oh, do I do I bug people about getting texts and stuff in the audience?
3620080	3622240	No, just because I was sitting up front.
3622480	3625680	Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm it's pretty laissez-faire here.
3626320	3628080	So it's not it's not rigorously structured.
3628080	3630040	I didn't want to be rude. OK, Dan Harmon.
3630040	3633240	Although Jeff will come down on you pretty hard if you're my girlfriend.
3633400	3638880	That's as far as I can tell, that's the only standard that's that's actually upheld.
3638920	3640360	I mean, the night's not over yet.
3640360	3642960	Are you familiar with my girlfriend and Erin McGathey?
3643760	3646480	No, you know, I've got to be honest,
3646480	3651120	I really just started watching community because I'm in love with Donald Glover.
3651480	3654360	Can I just plug that? Yeah, no, you can plug that. Yeah.
3657120	3659520	He can use it.
3659720	3661320	I'd like to plug that.
3663160	3665320	Can I strap that on?
3666000	3667000	Yeah, no, it's good.
3667000	3670680	The kid could use a break like that's all do what you can tonight.
3670680	3674560	Spread the word that Donald Glover's out there and he's he needs your help.
3676920	3679520	He's amazing. I think he's I you know, I hate to play favorites
3679520	3683200	and people always like but I would always say people would go as your favorite.
3683200	3684720	And then I would go as well.
3684720	3685960	Nobody. I'm not allowed to say that.
3685960	3689200	Then I would always also supposedly ironically, I would go.
3689200	3690360	But Donald's my favorite.
3690360	3693400	But I should be. The beauty is I wasn't being ironic.
3693400	3695160	I was right. I mean, he's amazing.
3695160	3699080	He works really hard and he and he puts out rap albums
3699080	3703560	and all of his raps are about how hard he works and how women and women
3703560	3707040	need to get used to the fact that I'm I'm going to keep working really hard.
3708280	3710880	I'm going to stay up all night.
3710880	3713120	You got a problem with that?
3713120	3715120	I got work to do.
3717280	3720680	It's funny. It's it's he and he really means it.
3720680	3723920	Like in some of his some of his raps, they get really dark
3724280	3728280	like because he's like he's actually like literally talking about like working
3728280	3731640	until he dropped dead, kind of like like it's a it's poetic.
3732080	3734040	It's disgusting. It's beautiful.
3734040	3736400	Dan, do you think there's a way this might be too high concept,
3736400	3738360	but if it is, we can edit it out from the podcast.
3738360	3740760	Do you think we can bring Spencer up our dungeon master
3740760	3743360	and bring all of the people we have of different ethnicities
3743360	3746480	and put them in some sort of D&D Thunderdome together
3747280	3751560	and maybe settle some some some some weird racial Thunderdome.
3751560	3754680	I think the only person that's not that that would have a problem with that
3754680	3759960	is Spencer, because you're talking about your characters need character.
3759960	3762840	Spencer. Is that is that above and beyond the call of duty?
3765840	3768200	Spencer coming up. Let's try. Let's try it out. Come on.
3775000	3778840	I'm not sure what's on the table here, but I'm just saying it's like
3780920	3782600	we have Spencer, our dungeon master here.
3782600	3785800	We've we're going to try to settle some old racial scores here.
3785840	3788440	You're saying we have all of our ethnic guests.
3789880	3793200	Who feels unrepresented ethnically right now? Anybody?
3794560	3796160	All right, we're good.
3797800	3799800	Does Adam know that Asperger's is in a race?
3802480	3805080	Or is he or is he going to come bounding up again?
3806280	3808720	We can make him an honorary race.
3809720	3813560	But yeah, I mean, they're going to have to share a microphone.
3813560	3816000	I don't know. It might be it might be more trouble than it's worth.
3816000	3818120	It's the kind of idea that makes everyone clap.
3818120	3821000	But then turns out, like it doesn't really work.
3821000	3823920	But what do you think that way to make that work, Spencer?
3823920	3828200	And no, well, I mean, I don't know how to teach tons of people how to play.
3828200	3831280	But if you guys go along with like that, you're just acting in the
3831280	3834400	in the story of what the hell we're talking about on stage.
3834400	3836200	Like it should be kind of OK.
3836200	3837400	I could make a suggestion.
3837400	3839240	I don't want to put things too much on the rails,
3839240	3841560	but I am a writer by profession and a storyteller.
3841840	3843920	Well, my suggestion and a genius.
3843920	3847280	My suggestion would be that maybe perhaps at some point in the adventure
3847280	3850800	that unfolds, maybe we would we would we would encounter
3850800	3855000	some kind of spiritual situation where there would it would call for a chorus
3855000	3860360	of of of of of spirits from beyond multi.
3860400	3863080	And that would be like a Greek chorus.
3863280	3865280	I'm just trying to reverse engineer from what it's
3865440	3868760	the reality is going to be like eight people standing in front of a microphone
3868760	3871640	going like this. So so what would they be playing?
3871640	3874000	I don't know. Maybe or maybe a Hydra.
3876880	3878920	A racial Hydra.
3878920	3880360	Should we get Steve up here?
3880360	3883560	Yeah, Steve Agee, who was here last week.
3883560	3885680	Let's welcome Steve Agee to the stage.
3885680	3887800	I know you're you're wondering what you should do, Piper.
3887800	3889560	I wonder, too.
3889560	3892880	Well, well, first of all, let's give Piper her props and we'll
3892880	3896040	we'll see what you can have your seat so that you're you know,
3896040	3897160	I'm a little bit offended.
3897160	3901040	You didn't ask me what my family thinks about black.
3901080	3902920	Well, I didn't ask everybody.
3903920	3907360	I only asked the Korean guy what what his family because I didn't.
3907360	3908120	I mean, I don't know.
3908120	3910960	Somehow it felt funnier to do that.
3910960	3914200	Maybe that's a new that's I discovered a new form of racism
3915240	3917280	that that I think that's hilarious.
3917280	3920120	That Korean people and black people, like if they wouldn't get along.
3920120	3923600	But I didn't I didn't find anything funny about the idea of digging
3923600	3925280	that up with with with you.
3925280	3927600	That's OK. I was just feeling left out.
3927600	3928360	Well, don't know.
3928360	3931640	It's all because I am a horrible, weird, twisted, labyrinth of racism.
3931640	3933240	How do your parents feel about black people?
3933240	3934800	Yeah. Tell us now.
3934800	3938560	I mean, I solely date black guys, so they're pretty used to it by now.
3938720	3942280	But it's the reason you do it is because obviously they hate black people.
3942960	3946200	No, no, I mean, I think they're OK with it.
3946320	3948640	Which is why Donald Glover and I should get married.
3948640	3951880	Right. But your dad didn't sit on the edge of your bed at night and go,
3951880	3954760	well, you do me one favor.
3954760	3958400	If you could do one thing for me, Piper, please, just like really.
3960240	3964200	Not I mean, it's something I mean, like when you have a fetish like that,
3964360	3965280	maybe, well, I don't know.
3965280	3966720	My mom didn't like hate redheads.
3966720	3968800	Oh, I mean, I don't care.
3968800	3971200	I'm from Seattle. My parents are very liberal.
3971200	3971800	What are you thinking?
3971800	3975960	Oh, so you're saying you're owning a an actual physical fetish.
3975960	3979120	Like if you if you're walking down the street, you see an attractive
3979120	3984600	African-American man, you you you're going to like your senses are heightened.
3985240	3986720	Like my spidey senses.
3986720	3988960	Yeah, probably. Yeah.
3988960	3991400	So what do you think that's childhood experience?
3991400	3996000	Do you think there was some hot guy that like, you know, I don't even know.
3996400	3996960	Yeah, I don't know.
3996960	3998480	Because I don't know. I don't know.
3998480	4000520	I have a thing about redheads and I don't know.
4000520	4003080	You know, like I had a redhead ant. That's creepy.
4003280	4006040	Yeah, Batgirl was a redhead.
4006040	4009680	I used to watch Batman reruns and Batgirl when she would Yvonne Craig,
4009680	4013200	when she would become Batgirl, she'd she'd have this beautiful red wig
4013200	4016000	like flowing out from under her bat mask and then she'd be kicking around
4016000	4020840	in her tights and but then there was also Nicole McHugh in kindergarten.
4020880	4022960	Like she was this beautiful little redhead.
4022960	4024440	Well, you can't say a kindergartner is beautiful.
4024440	4026840	I was a kindergartner, too.
4028360	4030560	I was I wasn't in a van outside the school.
4031560	4034120	This is a hot kindergartner.
4034120	4036920	She had everything, man.
4037760	4040760	And could she fingerprints?
4045560	4048840	But I remember distinctly remember her as being a redhead.
4049000	4051120	That's got to be as far back as you can possibly go.
4051120	4052960	That was so but I don't know.
4052960	4056640	The question is, is my circuit board does have a predilection?
4056840	4059400	Do I see the red hair and it's instinctive?
4059480	4061880	Is there something or is it a childhood experience?
4061880	4065280	So we go to our graves wondering about that.
4065880	4068920	I mean, maybe it was the lack of growing up.
4068920	4071680	I mean, I grew up with like two black kids. Maybe.
4072280	4074880	I mean, I, you know, I don't know. Yeah.
4076680	4078800	It's like it's like it's like being in harmontown.
4078800	4081040	Yeah, except for entities, my neighbor.
4081440	4083600	So I get to see him all the time.
4083600	4085480	Sorry, Dan.
4085600	4089720	Any. I mean, I wish.
4091720	4093360	Hey, what's happening?
4093360	4096560	There's more. There's more to this than.
4098360	4099760	Oh, yeah, I know you can sit down.
4099760	4104600	Yeah, I, you know, like that, that's spiraled very quickly
4104600	4107200	because I was like, who's more embarrassed and who like what's
4107200	4109080	what's the backstory? What's going on?
4109080	4110680	I could right now.
4110680	4114240	Now it's forever rotating and I want to embarrass you guys.
4116480	4120200	Well, because obviously there's some some kind of weird platonic.
4121080	4122600	Maybe not. Maybe they're.
4122600	4124480	No, but I'm saying like we don't.
4124480	4126720	Maybe they're driving straight after the Madonna in after this.
4126720	4130120	You know, I don't I don't know who feels what and what's going on.
4130120	4132600	But I know I know a minefield when I see one.
4132600	4134840	I got it. And I've been in them.
4134840	4138360	And I've appreciated it if people didn't bother to exacerbate it.
4138360	4141080	Steve, how do your parents feel about black people?
4141080	4143400	My parents are dead. They were killed by black people.
4146080	4149240	Why don't you ask me how I feel about black people, Jeff?
4150600	4153640	Because you own everything.
4154640	4157000	I assume they're fine with them.
4157000	4160240	My parents are both alive, actually.
4160240	4162360	My parents were too fine with black people.
4162360	4165400	My parents were so fine with black people that they made me racist.
4165400	4169160	They made me the new definition of racist, which is racially obsessed.
4169160	4171320	I've talked about this a lot of a lot.
4171400	4174840	Like it's my my my origin story is my mom
4175080	4178040	had I was playing with these two Sesame Street figures.
4178680	4182360	One was Gordon and one was Lewis or maybe Mr. Hooper.
4182600	4184520	Let's keep it simple.
4184520	4187760	And we're playing with a Mr. Hooper character.
4188600	4190440	That's amazing.
4191720	4194240	He owned a store.
4195680	4198960	And my mom said, what's that?
4198960	4202560	What's the what's the difference between those two guys that you're playing with?
4202920	4205760	And I was like, I don't know.
4205840	4207280	She's like, really? You don't know.
4207280	4209600	You don't know anything's different about them.
4209720	4211480	I said, well, one guy's got an orange shirt.
4211480	4214320	I said, I said something like Trivial and my mom,
4214680	4219280	if she had stopped their fucking bullseye, great 70s liberal mom.
4219280	4222480	Instead, she goes like, that is so good
4222480	4225360	because the difference is one is black and what is white.
4226360	4228360	And it's so good that you don't know
4228360	4230960	because a lot of people do know the difference.
4230960	4233760	And it's a big thing in this country and you're going to learn.
4234200	4238080	But my mom has a well-intended like like stuff.
4238080	4239920	She just made a balloon animal out of my brain.
4239920	4243840	I remember and there was some there was a mini series about the Holocaust
4244560	4247520	on a network TV at some point when I was a kid.
4247520	4250600	And I remember my mom coming into my bedroom and sitting on the foot of my bed
4250600	4253440	and going, Daniel, wake up, listen.
4255600	4258640	It may not happen tomorrow, but it will happen at some point.
4258640	4261360	There is going to be a time when people start to deny
4261520	4263640	that something called the Holocaust happened.
4263760	4265720	Whoa, what?
4265720	4268040	And you need to remember that it happened
4269440	4270840	because I might be dead.
4270840	4272880	Saw Holocaust deniers.
4273240	4275200	Well, I think they were around at the time.
4275200	4277640	I think she read a crawl at the end of a fucking movie
4277640	4279440	and took it to the streets.
4279440	4280960	I don't think she was that imaginative.
4280960	4283520	This is the same woman who said of everyone loves Raymond.
4283520	4286920	Are these writers under our floorboards?
4286920	4289040	She's pretty impressionable.
4289040	4290560	That's why I moved to L.A.
4290560	4293040	Because I like, like, how do I get this woman to love me?
4293040	4297160	The answer was obvious, like, like, like make the talking box talk.
4299760	4302960	Still hasn't fucking worked.
4302960	4305520	She's still a bitch.
4305520	4306880	All right. All right.
4306880	4309280	Holy shit, it's 930. Yeah, fuck.
4309320	4312200	Spencer, I love race.
4312200	4314920	Spencer, our dungeon master, bring us up to date.
4314920	4316600	Where are we in our journey?
4316600	4319920	When we last met, our heroes had newly resolved
4319920	4322920	to end Admiral Darkstar's blight on the forest.
4323360	4326240	Coming upon the mound of corpses, Sharpie and company
4326240	4330800	discovered an unlikely ally in the form of Morris Goldbright, a cleric.
4331480	4334640	Swiftly, they came upon the dark ziggurat, thinking quickly.
4334640	4338600	Quark hit himself in among corpses, infiltrating the dark compound.
4339520	4342160	With a stolen cloak, Sharpie smuggled his compatriots
4342160	4345920	in through the front door after defeating a skeletal abomination.
4346080	4349880	Sharpie, Quark, Mulrain and Morris stopped taking a breather
4349880	4352720	before the climactic encounter upstairs.
4355000	4357360	Spencer, I love you so much.
4357360	4359360	That was really good. That was really good.
4359360	4361400	We should call it quits.
4361400	4363400	But more important, more important than me loving you.
4363400	4365560	I want to say because I never get a chance to tell you.
4365560	4367440	Everybody, everybody loves you.
4367440	4369640	Don't don't don't don't don't let that affect you.
4370600	4373240	Yeah, I love you guys, too. You're all really great.
4373240	4376000	Thanks for the comment that I hear all the time is, man,
4376000	4378160	did you hit the fucking jackpot? Was he a plant?
4378160	4379560	What do you ask for a dungeon master?
4379560	4381080	And he raised his hand and he came up.
4381080	4383520	Yeah, the original idea was that we were going to try out
4383520	4386000	different people every week and we'd find the best dungeon master.
4386000	4388800	But we found Spencer and like like everyone else can go.
4388840	4390280	Is that right? Yeah.
4390280	4392640	Can I tell you guys a weird story about that is like
4392640	4395600	I listened to your podcast a few times and I was going to come
4395600	4398400	like the week before I came up on stage and I couldn't.
4398600	4400520	And I thought it was a different time.
4400520	4403520	So I was just but when I was listening, I heard you and you never said it.
4403520	4405400	But I was like, you know, I bet if I went there,
4405400	4407280	I might be able to dungeon master for Dan Harmon.
4407280	4409360	Like that was literally a thought in my head.
4409360	4411960	It was the stupidest and, you know, you never entertained those thoughts.
4411960	4414880	But then I show up and then he asked and I was like, oh, shit.
4415120	4418520	Yeah, this one hand shot up and we brought him on stage.
4419200	4420280	Have you ever been a dungeon master?
4420280	4421480	He's like, yeah, today.
4421480	4424360	I was I was making character sheets this afternoon.
4424400	4425360	That was amazing.
4425440	4427680	This is the kind of connection that white people have with each other.
4429720	4431160	You don't know what it's like.
4431160	4434200	Star, Auntie, Chris, Jason.
4434480	4436680	What is your what is your heritage, Spencer?
4436680	4438560	What are your ancestors hail from?
4438560	4440240	I'm Viking.
4440240	4444480	Cleop, Cleveland, Izen guard, Cleveland.
4445480	4448480	I'm told I have some Native American in my blood, but I don't
4448480	4451520	I don't qualify for those scholarships.
4452720	4454920	So who cares?
4454920	4455960	Not enough.
4455960	4457800	See, so you're part Native American part.
4457800	4462360	Well, like like German, Polish, what are you, German?
4462480	4463440	I don't know.
4463440	4464600	Isn't you, Jack? I'm sorry.
4464600	4465560	Is that a thing?
4465560	4467040	Is that a thing that white people do?
4467040	4469160	Or they go like, I'm part Native American.
4469560	4471480	Not enough to qualify for one of this.
4472480	4474760	Can we not leave?
4474760	4479600	Can we not just strip all the buffalo and rape the earth
4480480	4482480	to exterminate them?
4482480	4484360	I was to just confine them.
4484360	4488040	And then put casinos where they live and take all that money.
4488360	4492400	And then that's not enough to go on fucking scholarship.
4494920	4497040	I'm just trying to be laughing.
4497040	4500600	But like, it's it's so amazing.
4500600	4503080	We are an amazing race.
4503080	4506160	BJ, BJ, everybody, BJ.
4506160	4508240	All right, so Spencer, let's examine those upstairs.
4508240	4509920	What do we got up there? Can we walk up there?
4509920	4513240	We'll hold up, you guys.
4513240	4516760	Standing at the foot of the staircase, ascending upwards into darkness,
4516760	4519160	you decide to take a quick break to catch your breath.
4519600	4522600	You reflect on all you've been through and everything you've overcome.
4524520	4526280	Ding. You gain a level.
4543240	4544240	Feels good, doesn't it?
4544240	4545240	God damn it.
4545240	4547240	Now, Spencer, what does that mean?
4547240	4550240	It means you are incrementally stronger.
4552240	4556240	With a sense of empowerment and a slight incremental advantage,
4556240	4558240	you decide to head upstairs.
4558240	4560240	Wait, a sense of entitlement or empowerment?
4560240	4562240	Empowerment.
4562240	4563240	And entitlement.
4563240	4565240	I increased my sense of entitlement.
4566240	4568240	I should kill so many more dragons than I do.
4568240	4571240	I'm level two. These stairs don't mean nothing.
4571240	4576240	All right, so I walk up the stairs.
4576240	4579240	You head up the stairs.
4579240	4581240	Do you guys follow or?
4581240	4583240	Wait for me.
4583240	4586240	Oh, Morris Goldbright.
4586240	4588240	I follow.
4588240	4593240	You head up the stairs for what seems to be five minutes.
4593240	4596240	Are there a lot of stairs, or are we just taking our time?
4596240	4598240	You don't even know.
4598240	4600240	You can't even tell.
4600240	4602240	Is it dark?
4602240	4604240	The stairway is dark.
4604240	4606240	Way to go, Morris.
4606240	4609240	The steps might be large or something.
4609240	4611240	I don't know.
4611240	4613240	I don't know.
4613240	4615240	Way to go, Morris.
4615240	4618240	The steps might be large or something.
4618240	4621240	You approach the second floor.
4621240	4623240	The floor of this room is black flagstone,
4623240	4626240	clean and shining from the light of several iron candlesticks
4626240	4628240	about four feet high.
4628240	4631240	A large altar form of bones and silver stands in the middle of the room
4631240	4634240	with a pile of corpses changed to it.
4634240	4637240	Underneath the corpses, you can see the struggles of an arm and a leg
4637240	4640240	and the terrified shrieks of a human female.
4640240	4642240	Someone's trapped in there.
4642240	4644240	It's trapped underneath what?
4644240	4647240	A pile of corpses on a silver and bone altar.
4647240	4650240	That's how you guys found me, remember?
4650240	4652240	You were under some corpses.
4652240	4655240	As memory serves, you had hidden there.
4655240	4659240	This is involuntarily under some corpses.
4659240	4661240	Can we speak to her?
4661240	4663240	Can we dig her out?
4663240	4665240	Can you call out for her?
4665240	4667240	I call out to the woman under the thing.
4667240	4669240	What do you say?
4669240	4671240	Denzel, what gives?
4671240	4678240	We're under a bunch of dead bodies.
4678240	4680240	How?
4680240	4683240	I run over to her aid and remove the dead bodies from her.
4683240	4685240	You remove...
4685240	4687240	The dead body pile is quite heavy.
4687240	4691240	You might be able to shift it over, but it may be easier to tug her out.
4691240	4693240	I tug her out.
4693240	4696240	You tug her out.
4696240	4698240	If you know what I mean.
4698240	4700240	She enjoys your tugging.
4701240	4705240	Successfully extricating the damsel from the pile of corpses,
4705240	4710240	she wretches on the floor before straightening herself out and thanking you properly.
4710240	4713240	Thanks, fine, sir.
4716240	4719240	I just vomited. I'm not too eloquent.
4721240	4725240	Come on, Sharpie. You're our leader. What do you got?
4725240	4728240	What's the haps?
4729240	4732240	I was captured by a dark warlord.
4732240	4735240	He sought to sacrifice me to his dark gods.
4735240	4738240	How'd you end up under those bodies?
4738240	4743240	Well, I was knocked out, and the next thing I knew, I was under bodies.
4743240	4746240	It smelled dark and terrible. It smelled dark.
4746240	4749240	What's your name?
4749240	4753240	Karen Broadleaf of the Butts Plains.
4754240	4760240	Sharpie realizes that these are the very plains that his father owns.
4762240	4768240	Are you a serf from my family's domain?
4768240	4773240	Not a serf, am I, but a great warrior in the Butts-a-Lot tribe.
4773240	4777240	I am of the Butts-a-Lot tribe.
4777240	4781240	Are you the Lost One?
4782240	4784240	Yes?
4784240	4788240	That is crazy. You are foretold of in prophecy.
4788240	4793240	The one who is tossed out by his father shall come to reclaim his father's throne.
4795240	4800240	If I had known that, I wouldn't have left, but then that would be ironic.
4800240	4803240	So what brings the four of you here?
4803240	4806240	Fortunate and glory. No offense to Jason.
4806240	4810240	That's an Indiana Jones reference. Okay, never mind.
4812240	4814240	Was that a short round reference?
4814240	4819240	Yeah, forget it. You have to do Rubik's Cube of racism.
4819240	4822240	I was trying to keep the racial theme going.
4822240	4824240	What was your name again?
4824240	4826240	Karen Broadleaf.
4826240	4828240	Karen? Hello, Karen.
4828240	4829240	Hi.
4829240	4832240	How do your parents feel about black people?
4834240	4837240	Are you speaking of the Drow?
4838240	4841240	They hate being called that.
4844240	4846240	Can I look around the room?
4846240	4853240	You look around the room and you see a dark figure who's been eyeing you this whole time waiting for a chance to strike.
4853240	4855240	Is this Admiral Darkstar?
4855240	4856240	You don't know.
4856240	4861240	I call out to him. Are you Admiral Darkstar?
4861240	4866240	There he stands holding a black longsword and wearing full black plate mail.
4866240	4870240	In his fist he has clutched a metal stone.
4870240	4875240	It appears to be like your fragment of power that you found at the Trove,
4875240	4879240	but this is dark and emanating vicious pulses of dark energy.
4879240	4880240	Dark.
4882240	4886240	You fools have played right into my hands!
4892240	4895240	He unleashes a wave of energy. You feel numb.
4895240	4896240	No!
4898240	4903240	Now you're taking will saves according to the rules to see if you actually are affected by his dark magics.
4903240	4904240	Fuck.
4906240	4910240	Sharpie and Quark manage to shake it off, but Maris is stricken and paralyzed.
4910240	4914240	Help me. Help me. Help me.
4916240	4922240	I knew that your star metal had revealed itself, but I didn't think you'd simply deliver it to me.
4922240	4924240	Deliver it?
4924240	4926240	Telekinesis!
4929240	4933240	You feel a tug at your pocket and you feel the fragment of power leave.
4933240	4935240	It is flying towards him.
4935240	4939240	I... Do I... Can I attempt to hang on to it?
4939240	4944240	You attempt to grasp it from the magical clutches of Admiral Darkstar.
4944240	4946240	But are you fast enough?
4947240	4949240	You were fast enough.
4950240	4952240	Yeah.
4953240	4958240	Clutching the stone out of mid-air, you seem to halt Darkstar's spell.
4959240	4961240	Oh, Admiral.
4962240	4966240	You're right about one thing. A delivery's been made.
4969240	4972240	You just forgot to write down the address.
4973240	4975240	You...
4977240	4979240	Ray of Frost!
4980240	4986240	As he is charging up with anger and energy, you cast a Ray of Frost directly into his face.
4988240	4993240	The Ray of Frost whizzes past his head and freezes a wall behind him.
4993240	4998240	Berserker rage! You fly into a Berserker rage.
4999240	5001240	Would you like to attack now?
5002240	5005240	Yeah, I'm not going to wallpaper the room.
5006240	5009240	Raging like a maniac, you wallpaper the room.
5013240	5016240	I struggle to stand up.
5020240	5022240	You pull yourself to the feet.
5022240	5026240	Whoa. Did someone get the number of that truck that hit me?
5027240	5034240	Wait, I have the power to heal light wounds if I'm not mistaken, right? Does he need that? Does Morris need that?
5034240	5035240	He does not.
5035240	5038240	Okay, well, fuck it. You are raging.
5038240	5040240	I want to attack him in a Berserker rage.
5040240	5047240	Pulling your flaming sword from its sheath, you activate its powers. It is reaved in flames.
5047240	5054240	You charge at the enemy, Admiral Darkstar. He blasts a mighty dark beam of energy at you.
5057240	5061240	It flies past you and blows a hole in the wall behind you.
5061240	5064240	Wait, how's the wallpaper?
5066240	5068240	I repair the wallpaper.
5068240	5070240	You quickly repair the wallpaper.
5070240	5073240	I attack him with my mace.
5073240	5075240	Rushing towards Admiral Darkstar.
5075240	5076240	My heavy mace.
5076240	5080240	You fling your heavy mace into his chest.
5081240	5087240	You strike him squarely in the chest. He steps back in pain.
5087240	5088240	Suck it.
5090240	5092240	He takes eight damage.
5092240	5093240	Is that good?
5093240	5095240	How many does he need?
5095240	5096240	I don't know. You don't know.
5096240	5097240	I'll go find out.
5097240	5101240	Reduce person. Before you cast reduce person.
5101240	5105240	He strikes his sword towards Morris Goldbright.
5105240	5106240	Uh-oh.
5106240	5107240	Oh, fuck.
5108240	5111240	My sword will cut you in two!
5112240	5118240	It does not. It hits painfully but not deadly on your armor.
5118240	5119240	You are fine.
5120240	5121240	Reduce person.
5121240	5122240	Reduce person!
5123240	5126240	He is entitled to a fortitude save, I believe.
5127240	5128240	What?
5128240	5135240	He fails his save. He shrinks from six foot two to a good three foot eight.
5135240	5136240	Nice.
5136240	5139240	Can I do my Berserker Rage with my sword right now?
5139240	5141240	You're already in your Berserker Rage.
5141240	5142240	I attack.
5142240	5144240	Swing your sword at the shorter target.
5144240	5147240	Let's see if you can adjust to his new height.
5149240	5152240	Your sword rings true against the foe's arm.
5152240	5156240	He drops his fist size crystal in anguish.
5157240	5158240	No!
5161240	5163240	I don't know who made this guy an admiral.
5164240	5166240	He takes eleven damage.
5168240	5169240	Oh, I'm sorry.
5169240	5171240	And five fire damage.
5173240	5174240	Yeah.
5175240	5177240	I don't know what that means but it sounds pretty fucking cool.
5177240	5179240	I pick up his crystal.
5179240	5180240	You pick up the crystal.
5180240	5183240	You feel the dark taint surging through you.
5183240	5185240	Negative energy.
5185240	5188240	Yeah, taint is a word. Look it up.
5193240	5196240	We might have a new title for the episode. Feel the dark taint.
5196240	5200240	Admiral Darkstar, Lord of all the distinct.
5202240	5208240	You feel the power of many demons surging through you, threatening to throw you off your alignment.
5208240	5212240	Only by focusing on the power of your gods can you maintain your sanity.
5214240	5216240	I focus on the power of my gods.
5220240	5222240	Stay neutral.
5223240	5226240	It's the spot, right, that's not right.
5226240	5230240	It's between the good and the evil. Right on the spot.
5230240	5232240	It's taint good.
5233240	5235240	What are you talking about?
5236240	5238240	He emanates a dark wave of energy.
5238240	5241240	You feel yourself knocked back five feet.
5244240	5245240	Oh shit.
5246240	5249240	Quark, you take a nasty blast of energy to the face.
5250240	5253240	I was just wallpaper over here, man.
5253240	5256240	And thus we're not prepared for the assault.
5257240	5261240	Six dark damage. That's not a type of damage, it's damage.
5263240	5266240	Burning hands, Edward.
5266240	5270240	Holding your hands together and summoning the power of fire.
5270240	5275240	A thin stream of flames jets out between your hands in a cone-shaped pattern.
5276240	5278240	Ow!
5279240	5282240	His armor heats up and becomes bright red.
5287240	5289240	He takes three fire damage.
5291240	5293240	Level one spells you guys.
5293240	5295240	I hit him again with my heavy mace.
5296240	5302240	You hold the powers of darkness at bay long enough to summon strength to swing your mace.
5305240	5307240	You get a critical hit.
5307240	5309240	You smash him right in the face.
5311240	5313240	I suck my taint.
5315240	5316240	Is it his turn?
5316240	5318240	Is it his turn or our turn?
5318240	5319240	It's...
5319240	5321240	I think it's your turn now.
5321240	5322240	My turn?
5322240	5325240	I'm just reading here a post-it note you gave me.
5325240	5330240	I have high charisma and I'm actually good at convincing people or scaring people.
5330240	5334240	I convince him to stop being an asshole.
5334240	5335240	Okay.
5335240	5337240	Phrase your arguments.
5337240	5338240	Phrase your arguments.
5338240	5344240	You admiral dark star, your reign of terror has gone on eons too long.
5344240	5354240	And I think it would be best that ye lay down your admiralty and join us in the quest for
5354240	5358240	fortunate glory and so forth.
5359240	5361240	A compelling argument indeed.
5362240	5364240	You rolled a two.
5366240	5372240	Dazed from the mace strike to the face, admiral dark star fails to hear your voice over the
5372240	5374240	sound of blood rushing to his head.
5374240	5375240	I wasn't proud of it.
5376240	5377240	I'm sorry, man.
5377240	5378240	You just roll low sometimes.
5378240	5379240	It's sad.
5379240	5381240	I want to help you out and do cool stuff like that.
5381240	5382240	No, it's cool, man.
5382240	5384240	The dice don't lie, man.
5385240	5387240	You fools!
5387240	5392240	Telekinesis!
5392240	5394240	We are healing.
5394240	5398240	He summons the fist size crystal away from Morris.
5398240	5400240	Do you attempt to grab it out of his hand?
5400240	5401240	Hell yes.
5404240	5405240	You fail to grab it out of his hand.
5405240	5406240	No!
5406240	5408240	It flies back into his grasp.
5408240	5409240	Son of a bitch.
5409240	5411240	He grabs it and starts floating in the air.
5411240	5415240	You hear a rumbling as if the ziggurat is beginning to crumble.
5415240	5419240	Dark lightning bolts shoot out of his body and fingers.
5419240	5422240	Does my mysterious emerald dagger do anything?
5422240	5423240	It might.
5423240	5426240	I produced my emerald dagger and attack.
5426240	5428240	Just attack with a dagger?
5428240	5429240	You tell me, Jack.
5429240	5432240	Pulling the emerald dagger from your sack.
5432240	5435240	You charge head toward...
5435240	5437240	You attack!
5439240	5444240	The emerald dagger groans with green energy from the forest soul.
5444240	5446240	You strike!
5447240	5448240	You miss!
5448240	5449240	Shit!
5449240	5455240	A glimmering arc of green energy trails the blade as you slice cleanly above his head.
5455240	5457240	This is not my day.
5458240	5462240	Summon monster!
5462240	5464240	I used to have a list of...
5464240	5467240	You could summon like a celestial porpoise.
5468240	5471240	Let's see, a celestial monkey?
5471240	5473240	I could create water.
5474240	5476240	You have a fucking porpoise in here.
5477240	5480240	A giant spider or scorpion?
5480240	5481240	Perhaps a centipede?
5481240	5482240	A celestial porpoise, baby.
5482240	5485240	I would go with the scorpion.
5486240	5489240	A scorpion springs into existence before you.
5491240	5493240	Akira!
5495240	5498240	The scorpion waits for you to tell it it's bidding.
5499240	5501240	Sting!
5502240	5507240	Scuttling towards admiral Darkstar, it raises its sting wickedly.
5507240	5512240	A glittering arc flies through the air as the blade penetrates.
5513240	5515240	Does not penetrate.
5515240	5517240	Darkstar's armor.
5517240	5520240	I can command targets with one word.
5520240	5522240	Yeah, say a word and they'll do it like...
5522240	5523240	Sleep.
5523240	5524240	I tell them to sleep.
5524240	5526240	Sleep!
5528240	5529240	Okay.
5530240	5532240	Let's get the fuck out of here.
5533240	5535240	Steal his shit and get the fuck out of here.
5535240	5536240	Is he asleep?
5536240	5537240	He's sleeping.
5537240	5538240	Grab the stone.
5538240	5539240	Grab the glowing stone.
5539240	5540240	Grab his stone again.
5540240	5542240	The demonic energy swirls through you again.
5542240	5544240	You feel it corrupting you.
5545240	5547240	Admiral Darkstar lays sleeping.
5547240	5549240	But it does two stones, right?
5549240	5550240	Yeah, give it to me.
5550240	5552240	I've been able to handle this other one.
5552240	5554240	Combine the stones together.
5555240	5557240	Touching the stones together.
5557240	5563240	The golden brilliance of your stone turns the dark purple of the dark corrupted stone
5563240	5566240	to pure and silver for some reason.
5566240	5568240	Yeah, nice!
5568240	5571240	You feel the anger of the demons subside.
5572240	5577240	Karen Broadleaf takes the opportunity to jump on the unconscious Darkstar and starts wailing on her.
5577240	5579240	I say we don't kill him.
5579240	5582240	Let's just write in lipstick on the wall,
5582240	5584240	Welcome to the wonderful world of AIDS.
5584240	5585240	AIDS!
5588240	5589240	Just to fuck with him.
5589240	5592240	He'll spend the rest of his life wondering what that is.
5595240	5597240	There's magic to cure that stuff.
5599240	5601240	So where are we at?
5601240	5602240	He's on the floor.
5602240	5605240	There's a pile of corpses on an altar.
5605240	5606240	Karen's kicking his ass over there.
5606240	5607240	She's beating him up, yeah.
5607240	5609240	The wallpaper's looking pretty good.
5609240	5610240	It's lovely, right?
5611240	5623240	I say we consult with this episode's exclusive chorus of multiracial ghosts
5623240	5628240	to determine the fate of Admiral Darkstar who lays powerless before us.
5628240	5631240	I cast Summon Multiracial Ghost Chorus.
5631240	5635240	The ancestral spirits of the forest fly through the ziggurat.
5635240	5639240	Their swirling spiritual forms coalesce.
5639240	5644240	Come tall black drug user English teacher in Peru.
5644240	5645240	His name is Chris.
5645240	5646240	Chris.
5646240	5648240	Come Asian guy.
5648240	5649240	Jason.
5649240	5650240	Jason.
5650240	5653240	Come Puerto Rican possibly lady.
5653240	5654240	Piper.
5654240	5657240	Come black girl star with a star in the hair.
5659240	5660240	Enti.
5660240	5661240	I cast Enti.
5662240	5667240	And I Summon Adam Goldberg.
5667240	5670240	From the realm of Aspergia.
5671240	5673240	Your powers combined.
5678240	5680240	Their fists unite.
5680240	5681240	All right.
5681240	5685240	From left to right, say what your spirits command.
5688240	5689240	Mercy.
5692240	5694240	I think you could kick him.
5695240	5698240	I forgive him for his hate crimes.
5707240	5709240	What can I do?
5711240	5712240	You're a spirit.
5712240	5713240	You can haunt things.
5713240	5714240	You can do all sorts of stuff.
5714240	5717240	Okay, so can I just send him into space or something?
5717240	5719240	No, that's not a ghost power.
5720240	5721240	That's NASA.
5721240	5722240	He's a bad guy.
5722240	5726240	Should we give him mercy or kill him?
5727240	5729240	Let's just kill him.
5731240	5733240	Let's like burn him or something.
5734240	5736240	I cut him with a switchblade.
5737240	5739240	The swiftest.
5740240	5742240	Turn him into Chevy Chase.
5744240	5745240	All right.
5745240	5748240	Well, it seems like it's kind of even Steven.
5748240	5750240	Thank you, oh, multiethnic ghosts.
5755240	5757240	For your diverse wisdom.
5757240	5759240	You've heard the voices of the spirits.
5759240	5763240	I think that the way to collate all of that guidance
5763240	5765240	is to strip him of his dark armor
5765240	5772240	and bend him over like a rail or something
5772240	5778240	and put a sign on his back that says free ass.
5783240	5785240	So he'll be sodomized for all eternity?
5785240	5786240	No, no.
5786240	5787240	I don't know.
5787240	5789240	I was just being 13 years old.
5789240	5790240	I don't know.
5790240	5793240	He should definitely be naked.
5793240	5795240	Is there a way to turn him into good?
5795240	5797240	Is there a way to redeem him in some way
5797240	5799240	that we can bring out the good in him?
5799240	5801240	You are not aware of him.
5801240	5804240	Is there anything else in this room with us?
5804240	5807240	The room is bare other than the candlesticks,
5807240	5809240	the altar and the guys.
5809240	5810240	What happened to Karen?
5810240	5811240	Is she gone?
5811240	5813240	She's still beating him up.
5813240	5815240	He might be dead.
5816240	5820240	As I understand it, in the realm of butts,
5823240	5827240	the lower downs in that realm are often
5828240	5830240	tutelaged in the art of tattooing.
5830240	5833240	The butts' lower downs are, that's true.
5836240	5838240	Are you going to go dragon tattoo on this guy?
5838240	5841240	Yeah, let us put a dragon tattoo on him
5841240	5843240	that says dickhead.
5843240	5845240	Just put it on his forehead.
5845240	5847240	But how will you divest his armor?
5847240	5850240	Just seductively.
5851240	5853240	With a lawn?
5853240	5855240	A plumb.
5855240	5856240	What do you mean?
5856240	5858240	Boots first?
5859240	5860240	You tug on his boot.
5860240	5862240	It seems stuck.
5864240	5866240	Do we need to get the armor off?
5866240	5868240	Well, you were the ones that were talking about it.
5868240	5870240	I mean, I didn't say do that.
5870240	5872240	Well, let's just do the forehead.
5872240	5873240	Just do the forehead.
5873240	5876240	Just write dick on the forehead.
5876240	5878240	Of the helmet?
5878240	5881240	Oh, we can't even get his helmet off?
5881240	5883240	You haven't tried yet.
5883240	5885240	I remove the helmet.
5885240	5887240	Pulling the helmet loose.
5887240	5889240	You hear a almighty hiss.
5889240	5891240	As the helmet slides off,
5891240	5894240	a sludgy pool of black ooze and smoke
5894240	5898240	emits from the helmet hole.
5900240	5903240	A swirling and coalescing interest for this episode.
5903240	5905240	There's too many titles for this episode.
5905240	5906240	About seven feet tall.
5906240	5909240	It hisses foul demonic curses at you.
5909240	5912240	You're more powerful than I'd expected.
5912240	5913240	No matter.
5913240	5915240	The dark star's dawn will come,
5915240	5918240	and all will fall victim to its light.
5918240	5920240	Blaine our gate!
5920240	5923240	A portal opens up to a demonic plane.
5923240	5927240	You see rows of what look like black ships
5927240	5929240	that he's an admiral of.
5929240	5931240	Whoa!
5932240	5934240	He disappears into the gate,
5934240	5935240	and it winks out of existence.
5935240	5936240	Oh, we had our chance.
5936240	5937240	We had our chance to kill him.
5937240	5938240	We didn't take it.
5938240	5941240	Only his dark armor remains.
5941240	5942240	Maurice, maybe...
5942240	5945240	I wouldn't mind wearing this.
5947240	5950240	I could probably take it in a little bit.
5950240	5952240	Yeah, I'll put on the armor.
5952240	5954240	You take the armor.
5954240	5956240	Karen thanks you again.
5956240	5958240	Thank you again.
5959240	5960240	Thank you, Karen.
5960240	5962240	And thank all of us.
5962240	5963240	Everyone.
5963240	5967240	I think we've learned a lot today.
5967240	5968240	What have we learned, Sharpie?
5968240	5969240	Yeah, like what?
5970240	5972240	Well, we've learned to stay good
5972240	5974240	and be less evil,
5974240	5979240	because inevitably it seems to not pay off as much.
5979240	5982240	I learned that if you get a multi-ethnic ghost chorus,
5982240	5985240	not a lot gets accomplished.
5985240	5987240	It was gimmick driven.
5987240	5990240	You know, you made that promise,
5990240	5992240	and I was just trying to pay it off.
5995240	5998240	Let me give you the treasure of our people, says Karen.
5999240	6001240	She gives you a masterwork lute.
6001240	6004240	50 merciful arrows inside of a magic quiver.
6004240	6006240	Are these sexual positions?
6006240	6007240	I wish.
6009240	6011240	That's just true.
6011240	6013240	I give her a masterful lute right back.
6013240	6015240	I'd put it into her magic quiver.
6017240	6019240	I cast Swedish Reach Around.
6021240	6023240	A wand of magic missile
6023240	6025240	and a hat of disguises.
6026240	6028240	That's a magic hat, fellas.
6029240	6030240	All right.
6031240	6032240	Well, you don't beat a magic hat.
6032240	6033240	Thank you, Spencer.
6033240	6034240	Spencer, right?
6034240	6036240	That was very Tootsie the Dragon's adventure.
6038240	6039240	Wow.
6040240	6041240	My goodness.
6042240	6044240	The clock says 10 o'clock.
6044240	6045240	Yeah, we really...
6045240	6047240	The clock don't lie.
6047240	6048240	I wish it did.
6048240	6050240	I'm really sorry, everybody.
6050240	6052240	You keep coming and I keep punishing you.
6052240	6053240	I said I had nothing,
6053240	6055240	and then I had two hours of everything.
6055240	6056240	Yeah.
6056240	6057240	All right, let's just bring in the station.
6057240	6059240	First of all, Steve H, everybody.
6059240	6060240	Thank you, everybody.
6060240	6061240	Thank you, Dan.
6061240	6062240	Thank you, Jeff.
6062240	6063240	Steve, do you want to close it up
6063240	6065240	with your famous stand-up set?
6065240	6067240	Jeff, do I?
6067240	6069240	Let me get some music up for you.
6069240	6072240	Steve has the funniest five-minute stand-up set.
6072240	6073240	Hold up, hold up.
6073240	6074240	I don't know if we can...
6074240	6075240	About...
6075240	6076240	Everything.
6076240	6078240	About online dating.
6078240	6079240	No.
6080240	6081240	All right.
6081240	6084240	We're going to do a scene about...
6084240	6086240	I heard a plumber.
6090240	6092240	Oh, boy, you again.
6092240	6093240	Yeah.
6093240	6094240	I'd like a plumber, please.
6094240	6096240	Well, you got one.
6096240	6098240	That's not going to work either, is it?
6098240	6099240	All right.
6099240	6101240	We're running out of ways to close these shows.
6103240	6105240	We can't just keep bringing Adam Goldberg up.
6105240	6106240	I mean, that's...
6106240	6107240	Oh, no.
6107240	6109240	Well, the problem is we can,
6109240	6112240	but I don't think it'll...
6112240	6114240	He's like Beetlejuice.
6114240	6117240	Except you say his name once.
6117240	6119240	Adam, come over on stage.
6119240	6121240	I want to try something out again.
6121240	6123240	Let's see what it's like when Adam has nothing.
6123240	6125240	Oh, yeah, that's interesting.
6125240	6129240	Adam, I want you and Dan and Agee to kind of like just...
6129240	6130240	No, you hold it.
6130240	6133240	Kind of give us like a doo-wop.
6133240	6135240	You know, kind of like...
6135240	6137240	You want me to do the backbeat and whatever you like,
6137240	6139240	maybe, if I can follow your heart.
6139240	6140240	All right.
6140240	6141240	That was excellent, by the way.
6141240	6143240	I'm jelly, jelly.
6143240	6144240	I'm not peanut butter at all.
6144240	6145240	I'm very jelly.
6145240	6147240	Thank you.
6147240	6148240	All right.
6148240	6152240	Do a talk show doo-wop to close up the show.
6152240	6153240	Talk show doo-wop?
6153240	6157240	I'm trying to please Jeff's innocuous request
6157240	6159240	to turn this into Whose Line Again.
6159240	6160240	All right.
6160240	6165240	What's the hottest button, hottest button topical topic
6165240	6166240	that has...
6166240	6167240	What's that?
6167240	6168240	Race.
6168240	6170240	Well, yeah, we kind of trounced that.
6170240	6171240	Yeah.
6171240	6172240	The presidential debate.
6172240	6174240	The debate doo-wop.
6174240	6175240	But that's not really a hot button.
6175240	6177240	That's kind of like cupcakes.
6177240	6178240	Like you're supposed to be talking about that.
6178240	6179240	Cupcake doo-wop.
6179240	6180240	Cup, cup.
6180240	6181240	All right.
6183240	6184240	It's the worst.
6184240	6185240	I'm just going to backbeat this.
6185240	6187240	This is about you two guys.
6187240	6188240	It's about gray.
6188240	6190240	I'm wearing red.
6190240	6193240	Da da da doo-wop ba-doo-wop whenever you feel it.
6193240	6195240	Doo doo-doo-doo-doo.
6195240	6197240	Whenever you doo-doo-doo-doo.
6197240	6199240	Da doo-wop.
6199240	6200240	I go back to the chorus.
6200240	6203240	Da doo-wop ba-doo-doo-doo.
6203240	6205240	Cupcakes a-doo.
6205240	6207240	Gotta have you, da da da doo.
6207240	6209240	Girly, please.
6209240	6215240	You give me frosting on top of my cake, girl.
6215240	6219240	You got a pink collar but you're brown down there.
6219240	6229240	I got a multiracial cupcake in my oven for you tonight.
6229240	6232240	Da da da doo-wop ba-doo-doo.
6232240	6235240	You bake me at 350 good.
6235240	6237240	Da da da doo-wop ba-doo-doo.
6237240	6239240	You make me toasty and warm.
6239240	6241240	Da doo-wop ba-doo-doo.
6241240	6244240	I'm all confused about race, girl.
6244240	6246240	Teach me.
6246240	6250240	You bake me part of your and swarm.
6250240	6252240	Thank you, everybody, for coming to Harman Town.
6252240	6253240	Thank you.
6253240	6255240	Oh, we fucking did it.
6255240	6258240	Sometimes the closer is a lack of closer.
6258240	6259240	I think you'd all agree.
6259240	6260240	That's what's best.
6260240	6261240	10-0-5.
6261240	6263240	One more time, Brad and Goldberg.
6263240	6265240	They're our brand-new favorite.
6265240	6266240	Adam, shut the fuck up.
6266240	6269240	Steve Agee, everybody.
6269240	6270240	Show's over.
6270240	6275240	All our very brave volunteers, Chris and Piper.
6275240	6279240	And Jason, Andy, Chris, Piper.
6279240	6281240	We're missing anybody.
6281240	6283240	Also, Katie Levine, Zach McKeever, Emily Gordon,
6283240	6286240	Daniel Kramer, Dustin Marshall, Mo Fathomab, Jenny Fine,
6286240	6288240	and Cherie Shackett, all of our beautiful people
6288240	6289240	to help us out of Harman Town.
6289240	6293240	One more time for your mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
6293240	6300240	Dan, I do.
6300240	6303240	I do.
6303240	6307240	Dan, I do.
6307240	6310240	Dan, I do.
6310240	6311240	Now you can go.
6311240	6314240	It's Dan, I do.
6314240	6318240	Sorry it was long.
6318240	6320240	It's 10-0-6.
6320240	6321240	Thank you, everybody, for coming.
6321240	6323240	We love you so much.
6323240	6326240	Drive fast and take chances.
