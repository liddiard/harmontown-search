0	25480	Here ye, here ye, Harman Town is now in session.
25480	35560	I'm your guest comptroller Steve Agee and now here's the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan
35560	36560	Harman.
36560	50800	Hey, San Francisco, Booyah!
50800	53360	Thank you so much.
53360	57880	Thank you for staying for the movie and the Q&A and we have so much to be grateful for
57880	59240	with these fans.
59240	60920	They watch a two-hour movie.
60920	64400	Let's go around the stage and say what we're grateful for.
64400	65400	Early Thanksgiving.
65400	68520	Yeah, but it's San Francisco.
68520	69800	It's our favorite city, right?
69800	70800	Steve Agee?
70800	71840	Oh my god.
71840	72840	It's the New York.
72840	77440	I was given my choice of cities to comptroller at, guest comptroller at, and I said San Francisco.
77440	78440	No joke.
78440	81920	I love San Francisco.
81920	83920	It's the New York of California.
83920	84920	Kind of.
84920	88040	That's what they call it.
88040	90560	So much so that that offends them.
90560	91960	Just like New Yorkers.
91960	92960	Yeah.
92960	94960	Hey, fuck you!
94960	98360	This is the San Diego of California, you motherfucker!
98360	100440	The San Diego of California.
100440	101960	Oh, that's in California.
101960	102960	Never mind.
102960	109200	Let's see if I have any items to talk about in my giant iPhone 6 Plus Plus.
109200	110200	Six Plus?
110200	111200	That is massive.
111320	112320	Yeah.
112320	113600	I got the Six Plus Plus.
113600	114600	People don't even know it exists.
114600	116480	Me and Jon Hamm have this.
116480	124600	Okay, all right, here's something.
124600	128680	I don't cotton to using bodies for letters on billboards.
128680	132720	I don't think that you should be allowed to use a human body as a letter in the title
132720	133720	of your movie.
133720	134720	I won't allow it anymore.
134720	135720	Example.
135720	136720	Oh, well, I don't know.
136720	140400	John Warr, whatever that movie is.
140400	144920	Keanu Reeves, it says John Warr, and then like one of the letters is just Keanu Reeves.
144920	147560	We have to fill that in with our own brains.
147560	148560	What is it?
148560	152280	What is a human being?
152280	153440	Is he an A?
153440	155560	Is he an E?
155560	156560	You can't just assume.
156560	157560	Yeah, I figured it out.
157560	159560	I looked it up.
159560	160560	It's John Wick.
160560	162720	He's an I, motherfucker.
162720	167120	And then I get really pissed off because then it says John Wick, and then the tagline is
167120	171120	don't set him off.
171120	172840	Don't type set him off.
172840	173840	Thank you.
173840	174840	Good night.
174840	178000	We'll be at the bar next door.
178000	181840	Kettle one for everybody.
181840	188880	Don't set him off because he's a wick.
188880	192840	Because bombs use wicks?
192840	193840	Wicks?
193840	194840	No.
194840	196840	They use fuses.
197440	202920	His name's not John Fuse, and even if it was, the tagline should be don't use him to set
202920	206360	something off.
206360	212400	And if he's a wick, the only thing he can set off is a candle.
212400	216400	Don't use him to make the room slightly lighter.
216400	222120	Don't use him if you shit in someone else's bathroom and you need to cover it up.
222120	223760	Just call him John Bomb.
223760	224760	Yeah.
224760	225760	John Explosion.
225760	226760	John, John Boom Boom.
226760	229760	It was probably harder for him to make an O in a billboard.
229760	230760	Yeah.
230760	231760	He was thinking in advance.
231760	237760	Well, he could have done like a Home Alone thing, it'd be John Bomb and the O would be
237760	240760	Keanu Reeves' mouth going, oh!
240760	243760	I'm gonna blow up!
243760	248760	Don't set me off!
248760	254760	Steve, today a second man, a second man, jumped over the fence at the White House and charged
254760	255760	headlong at it.
255760	256760	It's about time.
256760	258760	Why doesn't this happen more?
258760	266600	Is it a federal offense for us to say, this is awesome?
266600	270000	We're not endorsing, we're not saying you should do it.
270000	274200	It's just a fun time to be alive out of all the fucked up shit to be going on.
274200	276040	I think it's kind of neat that...
276040	277760	It's some little rascal shit.
277760	280760	Yeah, it's like the Sandlot.
280760	283120	What are these guys doing?
283120	288800	The first guy had a knife and he got up to the, you know...
288800	291360	He got into the Lincoln bedroom and took a nap, right?
291360	299360	Yeah, he was by the statue of Martin Sheen with his knife, just stabbing it, practicing
299360	300360	for the real president.
300360	302360	Did this new guy have anything?
302360	305280	I don't think he had dog treats in his pocket.
305280	306280	Yeah, weaponized Ebola.
306800	308840	No, I don't know if he had anything.
308840	313360	He jumped over the fence and then the, I guess, two dogs got him right away and he kind of
313360	317480	punched the dogs a little bit, which got him assault charges.
317480	320720	So they have guard dogs now instead of like...
320720	322920	Obviously the people were not on the ball.
322920	326440	The first guy made it into the gift shop.
326440	332480	So the second guy, yeah, he ran up against the White House's best friend.
332480	333480	I don't know.
333480	334480	I think it's neat.
334480	337320	I think if you're going to have a White House and have a fence around it, I think it should
337320	339720	be a tradition that every once in a while some guy tries it out.
339720	343120	It is crazy that it's low enough to jump.
343120	346000	It should be like 12 feet high.
346000	350600	It should be, I mean, they'll probably add now to electrocute you if you touch it, right?
350600	352120	Which would be more appropriate.
352120	357120	It feels a little dishonest to have this beautiful house where you have orphans hunt for eggs
357120	358120	on Easter.
358120	361160	Where you save a turkey every Thanksgiving.
361160	364360	You know, we're just hanging out, running the country.
364360	365520	Come on in if you want.
365520	366520	Just kidding.
366520	369680	Hey, if you can jump the fence, welcome.
369680	370680	Come on in.
370680	375880	It's kind of appropriate if they have to actually make it lasers or something.
375880	379280	You put your hand through it and you lose your arm.
379280	381480	I don't know.
381480	387360	Speaking of current events, which I know people love to come to this show for, because there
387360	388360	is no other podcast.
388360	391120	If not this podcast, where would people hear about current events?
391120	393080	Where did you get your news?
393080	394080	Yeah.
394080	395080	Ebola.
395080	397560	It's tough stuff.
397560	398560	It's real.
398560	399560	It's real.
399560	400560	It's here.
400560	406920	I'll tell you guys, like I didn't know that much about Ebola and I didn't know, I wasn't
406920	408720	very informed.
408720	412840	And so I started looking at the articles and what I've learned from the comment sections
412840	419640	under them is that this disease is very scary, but on the other hand, it's also very overdue.
419640	423720	Like Africanized killer bees.
423720	428840	Remember as a kid, they were like, yeah, there's killer bees in South America and they're making
428840	429840	their way north.
429840	430840	And now they're in America.
430840	432320	I want to do that bit again.
432320	433320	Okay.
433320	438120	I wasn't that informed about Ebola.
438120	440960	And then what I've learned from reading the articles in the comment sections under it
440960	448120	is that it's a very scary disease, but on the other hand, it's very overdue.
448120	449520	Are we supposed to cheer that?
450040	451040	Yeah.
451040	454720	I guess my joke is that the people in the comment sections are so dumb.
454720	455720	You read the article.
455720	457220	It doesn't really matter what the article says.
457220	460560	By the time you get to the bottom of the comment section, you're like, fucking yes, like make
460560	467020	this wipe us out, cut us down with a machete.
467020	468020	Take us out.
468020	469520	We are so dumb.
469520	473920	It's like a clearinghouse for all the weird conspiracy theories and racist shit.
474920	480120	You see comments where people are like, I saw, I saw a comment where a guy said, uh, what
480120	481120	a coincidence.
481120	488420	Uh, an African plague after we elect our first African American president.
488420	492120	That is like, that is classic racism.
492120	493120	That's beyond.
493120	495520	That's like the Led Zeppelin of racism.
495520	499920	It doesn't even have to have anything to do with like break dancing or, you know, it's
499920	504640	not like implying that Barack Obama is going to paint the house, the White House with leopard
504640	505640	print or something.
505640	511000	It's like, it's like just going straight to the, yeah, he's, he's African American.
511000	517320	And so it's his fault that there's African and everybody, like the gun control people
517320	521440	like always find a way to like start arguing in the middle of a thing.
521440	524840	Like no matter what the articles about, there's always the people that come in and go still
524840	527040	like 14 people killed last week with handguns.
527040	530080	And then, and then, and then people take that bait and then it's just like, you read
530080	533120	these comments sections and you're just like, yeah, bring it in, man.
533120	534120	Bring the white walkers in.
534120	537160	What are we doing?
537160	538460	Let's get to the moon.
538460	540480	Let's put take San Francisco and put it on the moon.
540480	541480	I was going to ask you that.
541480	545720	I added one of my, one of my things to ask you because I haven't heard, heard you mention
545720	546720	in a long time.
546720	549040	I was like, did you bail on the colonizing the moon premise?
549040	550240	I'm back to it now.
550240	553680	I'm like, like we, we gotta, and it's not because of Ebola.
553680	554680	I'm not scared of Ebola.
554680	557000	I'm scared of, uh, I'm proud of our country.
557000	561320	For, for not like, I don't know, like, oh, this guy in New York's now got it.
561320	562320	He's a doctor.
562320	563920	He's a for doctors without borders.
563920	565080	He was, he was there.
565080	566080	He was in the shit.
566080	567080	No wonder.
567080	570360	I did see, this is one of my favorite comments is a very clever comment.
570360	574360	Like somebody said, uh, uh, don't worry Republicans.
574360	577320	All the people getting the disease so far have been helping people.
577320	578320	You're safe.
578320	579320	Oh my God.
579320	580320	That is great.
580320	581320	That was fucking awesome.
581320	583320	Uh, but it is true.
583320	584720	I mean, it is so far.
584720	589000	That's the way you can be in the first world and get the disease is caring too much.
589000	592520	And I, and there's in these people so far, they're, they're healthcare workers and the
592520	597680	idea that their health is, is, you know, I mean, I, it's, I'm proud of the fact that
597680	603280	we, we, we, we grabbed them and we, we, we, you know, we quarantined them and we, we're,
603280	607360	we're, we're doing everything we can and they're, they're okay so far and they got sick trying
607360	608360	to help people.
608360	613800	And it's, we gotta, we gotta, I think that's gotta be the way to do it.
613800	614800	You see these comments.
614800	617360	It's just like such a strange world we've interviewed people.
617360	619240	I don't even think they think of people as people anywhere.
619240	623040	They, they go like, oh yeah, we gotta, we gotta seal up the borders and let this thing
623040	624920	run its course.
624920	626800	Its course is people.
626800	632040	Its course is other dudes like, like, what do you, what course do you want it to run?
632040	635440	What are you going to, like, we think we're going to like shut, shut up America.
635440	641120	Like it's a newsstand and like just subsist on our own chewing gum and Mentos and, and
641120	646600	then open it back up and be like open for business, whoa, we're all our customers and
646600	647600	employees.
647600	652320	Uh, uh, but yeah, I, I'm, I'm, I hope that these people are okay.
652320	656560	I hope that that New York guy makes it through because he's like definitely, definitely got
656560	662800	that disease by like giving a huge shit that, that, that, that a lot of us don't give.
662800	669960	Uh, Guterman socks, that's, you wearing some right now?
669960	670960	Nope.
671760	676400	What I'm wearing right now are very threadbare socks where the, uh, ankle is all, there's
676400	678440	no ankles on my, any of my socks anywhere.
678440	681880	They all have holes where the ankles are and ankles or heels?
681880	690000	Oh, uh, you got sharp ankles, dude, heels, heel, heel, you're right, heel, old razor
690000	694840	blade, heels, Harmon over there, like where, where the heel is like, it's just skin.
694840	698000	And then it's like, so the top of the back of the shoe scrapes there.
698000	699000	Yes.
699000	701120	I don't know what I'm talking about.
701120	702120	I need new socks.
702120	703640	There's no, we've all been there.
703640	704640	What's that?
704640	705640	Wigwams.
705640	706640	Yeah.
706640	710200	Wear a fucking teepee on your feet, Dan.
710200	713000	Is that the, is that the new UGG wigwams?
713000	714000	Wigwams been around forever.
714000	715000	Yeah.
715000	716000	All right.
716000	717000	Like Ebola.
717000	720120	I'll check in with you in a second.
720120	721800	I I'm, I'm, I'm a man of means.
721800	726120	I could, I could procure my own socks like, like if I wanted to and I, and I just don't
726120	727120	do it.
727240	731520	The community writers were getting a lot done the other day.
731520	736160	I decided to reward us and incentivize more productivity by taking them to a bar.
736160	738200	We went to a bar and we were drinking.
738200	740000	We were trying to come up with another story.
740000	742640	Oh, what if, what if Abed does, does a magic trick?
742640	743640	I don't know.
743640	744640	Who knows?
744640	748120	And then this guy comes in with a big duffel bag and it's, and it's just teaming with
748120	751680	all these colorful socks and he's going, socks, socks.
751680	752680	In a bar?
752680	753680	Yeah.
753680	757320	And it's like a guy will walk into a bar and go like pepperoni or flour for the lady.
757320	761840	This guy had socks and it's like pepperoni.
761840	763560	I've seen flowers for a lady.
763560	765520	I've never seen the pepperoni guy.
765520	771800	Well in LA it's tamales and oh yeah, in Milwaukee there was a guy named Frank who would come
771800	776080	in and go pepperoni, cannoli.
776080	780720	And then you'd say, I'd like a pepperoni and he'd go, spice a mild.
780720	782600	I guess, I guess spice.
782600	786520	What kind of socks was this guy selling?
786520	788960	Just probably stolen.
788960	794600	I'm assuming because they were very cheap and they, he just had a lot of them and, and
794600	800840	so here, so here's my, here's my new philosophical epiphany.
800840	804960	So Dan Guterman, one of the writers, like he immediately, we're all going like, that
804960	807000	guy's selling socks in a bar.
807000	808200	Let's all react to that.
808200	810760	Let's all think of how funny that is.
810760	813120	Like what a, what a, what a, what an anomaly that is.
813120	814880	Why is he selling socks in a bar?
814880	821280	Dan Guterman's like, oh, uh, I need socks and he's like, he just enters into a transaction
821280	822280	with a guy.
822280	823280	Dan Guterman needs socks.
823280	826880	So now it's even funnier and I were like, yeah, Dan Guterman's buying socks from the
826880	827880	socks guy.
827880	830720	Not only did a guy selling socks come in, but Dan Guterman's buying socks.
830720	831720	This is the best.
831720	834720	I'm going to Instagram this, then the guy, the guy leaves.
834720	837580	I need fucking socks.
837580	838700	We all need socks.
838700	839700	We all need socks.
839700	841620	I especially needed socks.
841620	847900	I'm walking around with, with, with, with scraped, uncomfortable heels.
847900	848900	Moldy heels.
848900	850100	Cause your feet sweat in your shoes.
850100	857580	Because I allowed myself to be taken out of the moment by the matrix.
857580	864860	Guterman socks are thick and plush and, and because Guterman saw past the, he was like,
864860	869500	I'm not going to just enforce social mores and normality.
869500	871540	I'm just going to, he's selling socks.
871540	872540	I need socks.
872540	873540	I need socks.
873540	874540	I'll buy some fucking socks.
874540	877340	He made the practical anarchic connection.
877340	882780	He didn't run it through some super ego or governmental like regulator of like, like,
882780	886540	oh, the queen bee wouldn't like you selling socks right now.
886540	887980	I should make fun of you.
887980	889580	Maybe I could get comedy points.
889580	894900	Like he's like, my feet need socks, money, socks, transaction done.
894900	899220	He's getting Dan Guterman has socks and I don't, I'm walking around like a jackass.
899220	900460	I got bloody feet.
900460	906700	I'm a bloody, I'm just making a point, but like, I want everyone.
906700	909460	I think, I don't think San Francisco is the place you have to say this.
909460	912940	I think, I think San Francisco is, is a city full of Guterman's.
912940	914820	I think they, it's sock city.
914820	918460	That's what they, they used to be called the city by the bay.
918460	920500	Now it's called sock city.
920500	924420	They these guys, if they, if they see a Google bus, they'll storm it.
924420	925420	They don't care.
925420	928820	What's the, what's a Google bus?
928820	932820	There was a thing last year when we were here in San Francisco, somebody tweeted me about
932820	933820	this.
933820	935500	There's, I'll explain this to, to Agee.
935500	938860	I'm sure I'll get everything wrong.
938860	941380	Apparently there's a bit of a gentrification thing happening.
941380	943700	San Francisco has been through a lot of phases.
943700	944700	Yep.
944700	952460	There's like, there's, you know, there's, it's a beautiful city full of, full of wonderful
952460	957780	people and also some very affordable housing and it's just like a, it's a, it's a big mishmash
957780	963900	full of awesome hippies and scientists and whatever you call them.
963900	968900	And these, there's these people on this hill somewhere outside the city where they make,
968900	974580	they make the computers or something and they have, and they make a lot of money and they're
974620	979020	kind of like, they have to live in San Francisco and then they like, somehow this gentrification
979020	982840	thing happens where people get pushed out of neighborhoods that used to be affordable
982840	986180	or no longer affordable because landlords could make more money off of these, these
986180	990460	Silicon Valley types that are like, like, like, like, like moving in and they have their
990460	995820	own transportation or had, I'll use the past tense because I read about this.
995820	996820	Okay.
996820	1003220	They, they have, they have Google buses that take them up to Google mountain.
1003220	1005100	Is Google, but I don't know.
1005100	1006100	It's a Disney movie.
1006100	1007100	Do they really call it Google mountain?
1007100	1008100	No, I don't know.
1008100	1011140	I don't, I don't know about that part.
1011140	1015380	Escape to Google mountain.
1015380	1019300	And so, and so meanwhile, like, if you, if you park, if you park in the wrong place,
1019300	1022900	if you leave your car in the wrong place, you get a ticket, you get like a $70 ticket,
1022900	1027420	whatever, $700 ticket, it's, it's illegal to be poor as it is anywhere else.
1027420	1030340	It's also illegal to be poor in San Francisco.
1030340	1035100	It's not illegal to have a Google bus that can use the same bus lanes as regular buses.
1035100	1039340	So this is the side of the people I'm jumping into a whole thing that I don't know nothing
1039340	1040340	about.
1040340	1045260	But, but like, so there was a Google bus incident where there was a Google bus parked in a regular
1045260	1050460	bus lane, which technically speaking, a vehicle is not allowed to do and it should get a ticket.
1050460	1055220	So like kind of spontaneously, a bunch of citizens sort of like blocked the bus and
1055220	1058660	said, you're not leaving until you pay the fucking ticket we would get if our car was
1058660	1060220	occupying this space.
1060220	1062860	And they kind of like, and then the picket signs came out and they're like, Google bus
1062860	1068100	pay ticket, Google bus, we want the cops, give them a ticket.
1068100	1075100	And the people inside were like, what, all I did was, uh, uh, like Hubert in college.
1075100	1076860	I don't even know what the city is.
1076860	1082220	I've never, I'm from, I'm from, uh, Google gate.
1082220	1087780	I'm sure I got all of that wrong, but, uh, so that's what I got from skimming one USA
1087780	1089780	today article.
1089780	1096620	Uh, is there a Google, Google gate, uh, Google bus gate, uh, expert here, somebody that's
1096620	1101220	more intimately acquainted with the, with the, the hot buttons and you guys are bored
1101220	1102220	with it.
1102220	1106020	That's what I'm getting seeing folded arms and rolled eyes.
1106020	1107260	They want to get over it.
1107260	1111660	That's the other San Francisco's lived through a lot of phases of like interlopers.
1111660	1117060	The city survives these, these, uh, financial Vikings.
1117060	1121660	You know, everybody wants to live in San Francisco, they're always fucking with their
1121660	1123700	beautiful Eden and they weather it.
1123700	1125900	They weather it.
1125900	1133060	They don't applaud for being that being said, they're, they're, they're worn out from weathering
1133060	1134140	it.
1134140	1143800	And I would never solicit applause, uh, Hey, can I make a request since this is a very
1143800	1148520	special time of year, uh, can we do a Harman town sports corner?
1148520	1149520	Oh, sure.
1149520	1150520	Sure.
1150520	1151520	Sports corner.
1151520	1162880	What do you think, what do you think about what's going on right now?
1162880	1165480	And it's really obvious what I'm talking about.
1165480	1168960	Oh yeah, it's a very exciting time.
1168960	1169960	Yeah.
1169960	1177280	I mean, this is the time of year that all sports fans look forward to and, and, and,
1177280	1178280	and covet.
1178280	1181080	Like this is Christmas for sports fans is what I call it.
1181080	1184600	I don't even call it by its actual name.
1184600	1189160	I just call it Christmas for sports fans for America's favorite pastime fans.
1189160	1190160	Yep.
1190160	1191160	Whoa.
1191160	1192160	Whoa.
1192160	1193160	Yeah.
1193160	1194160	That's, that's baseball.
1194160	1195160	Yeah.
1195160	1196160	Yeah.
1197160	1204360	It's baseball time again, uh, the mother of all baseball, uh, the world series.
1204360	1205360	Yeah.
1205360	1206360	Yeah.
1206360	1208720	Who do you favor in, in this year's world series?
1208720	1216960	I mean, you've got a whole planet full of baseball teams, all convening into a series
1216960	1221780	of baseball games that, that where they gradually play each other and whittle down to just two
1221780	1222780	teams.
1222780	1226340	And that determines who's the best ball played baseball team on the planet, right?
1226340	1227340	Yeah.
1227340	1233380	I mean, I know you know that, um, right now we are at that very specific point in that
1233380	1234380	process.
1234380	1239420	We're, we're two games in, it's two games into the beginning of the whole process.
1239420	1243380	I don't mean to ask, I'm not asking a question, you know, it's not like the super bowl.
1243380	1244380	It's a series.
1244380	1251760	It's two games into the world series, which is like fucking like relative to the relative
1251780	1254300	to the world series duration.
1254300	1257340	Two games in is the plot point.
1257340	1258340	Yeah.
1258340	1264240	Where's the story circle or where Kevin McAllister gets left home alone.
1264240	1272300	I think I would say maybe or where Catherine Harrah comes back.
1272300	1273300	I don't know.
1273300	1274300	Oh, okay.
1274300	1280300	Well, I mean, I mean, well, you must be not much of a sports fan, but I, the world series
1280360	1282760	right now is at a fever pitch.
1282760	1285000	It's, it's neck and neck.
1285000	1286640	We don't know who's going to win.
1286640	1291520	Um, and it's just, I always careful being here right now.
1291520	1293080	You don't want to say the wrong team.
1293080	1297600	I love, I mean, look, this city's team is the best team.
1297600	1298600	That's right.
1298600	1299600	Yeah.
1299600	1304000	You can hear, you can hear it in their applause.
1304000	1305480	You can feel it in their hearts.
1305500	1312380	Uh, like this city has its team fever.
1312380	1314940	They have every reason to be very proud.
1314940	1321500	This is a huge corporation that has drafted people from all over and called them San Francisco
1321500	1322940	baseball players.
1322940	1329940	And what's not to be proud of the giants.
1329940	1330940	Yeah.
1330940	1331940	Wow.
1332840	1340720	Sport master San Francisco giants, two games into the world series, neck and neck with
1340720	1343560	their arch enemy, the mongoose to their cobra.
1343560	1344560	One and one.
1344560	1347640	Oh, could you ask for a more vicious opponent?
1347640	1350880	This is the front, oh God, it doesn't even matter, right?
1350880	1355280	You almost don't even need to say that the other teams, I would ignore them.
1355280	1357000	I don't think they're going to be much of a threat.
1357000	1361880	I think this, I think the giants are going to sweep there.
1361880	1362880	I don't know.
1362880	1364580	It's going to be tough.
1364580	1368700	Well, stay, stay tuned, man, because they've been getting the, they've been getting the
1368700	1369700	hits.
1369700	1370700	They've been getting the runs.
1370700	1377540	They've been getting the line drives and all of the pop-ups and that, that is the game
1377540	1378540	of baseball.
1378540	1383740	Like, like it's not, it's like people, people focus on foul balls and strikes.
1383740	1384740	It's not about that.
1384740	1389220	It's about, it's about line drives and pop-ups.
1389220	1390220	Pay attention to that.
1390220	1391880	The giants are king.
1391880	1393520	All right.
1393520	1395980	So good luck and we'll see you at the end of the World Series.
1395980	1396980	Hope you beat that.
1396980	1405520	That's it for Sports Corner.
1405520	1407120	Fuck the Kansas City Royals.
1407120	1408120	Oh, the Royals.
1408120	1409120	Oh, okay.
1409120	1416360	I saw, I saw, I saw a thing on Twitter now that makes sense that there was the radio
1416360	1420080	station banned the play of the Lord song.
1420080	1423620	You were just like, I think Ebola's in Kansas City.
1423620	1425260	I'm not going to follow up on this.
1425260	1427700	When you said that, Royals, I'm like, okay, that makes sense.
1427700	1428700	The Lord song.
1428700	1429700	Okay.
1429700	1431300	That's why that radio station banned the, yeah.
1431300	1432300	Okay.
1432300	1433300	That makes sense.
1433300	1434300	Yeah.
1434300	1435300	No, it doesn't.
1435300	1436300	It's like, does it make sense?
1436300	1439300	Someone in the front row said, does it?
1439300	1440300	No, not really.
1440300	1445500	I mean, it's not like, what, maybe, maybe think about putting a ban on top 40 songs
1445500	1449500	like or, you know, before they, they have a potential to get that out of control.
1449920	1451440	It's like book burning almost.
1451440	1452440	Yeah.
1454160	1457640	San Francisco is hard to, hard to pimp for applause.
1459640	1460640	They've heard it all.
1460640	1462960	They know what they like and they will only applaud for that.
1462960	1465760	You can't, you can't just come up here and go, yeah, I got my dick pierced the other
1465760	1466760	day.
1470160	1471160	Apparently you can't.
1471160	1472160	I don't even know why.
1472160	1481100	I just felt like it took a trolley over to the heroin shop.
1481100	1482780	It's not a trolley.
1484780	1486540	I think it's a cable car, Dan.
1486540	1488740	Wait, isn't that called a trolley?
1488740	1491100	I'm so sorry, you guys.
1491100	1493420	What the fuck is a trolley?
1493420	1494420	The difference is a trolley.
1494420	1495420	Mr. Rogers shit.
1495420	1496420	Well, okay.
1496420	1497420	So wait a minute.
1497420	1499140	I do have a question about that because I passed one of those.
1499140	1504360	I saw it, I saw it going up a hill, a cable car, but there was no cable.
1504360	1506880	It's underneath now or is it always underneath?
1506880	1507880	Okay.
1507880	1511640	So it's the other cities that are there overhead and they got the things hooked up to them.
1511640	1513040	Okay.
1513040	1514040	Those are trolleys.
1514040	1516400	If they're electric, they have the wires above them.
1516400	1517400	This is a cable car.
1517400	1518400	All right.
1518400	1525520	There's not literally a, it's like pulling it like a goonies device.
1525520	1526520	Are you fucking kidding me?
1526520	1530600	Yeah, that is, that's straight up little rascals right there.
1530600	1531600	That's insane.
1531600	1535400	Like a bunch of ducks in a pond pulling them under the street.
1535400	1536400	Jesus.
1536400	1540360	That is the dick piercing of mass transit.
1540360	1543000	This city has got it all.
1543000	1544680	They're not the New York of California.
1544680	1545680	No, no.
1545680	1551240	They're the Portland of the Bay.
1551240	1552240	Portland of the Bay.
1552240	1557080	You guys won't be happy until I say this city was made by God.
1557080	1560960	They built the city on rock and roll.
1560960	1562960	All right.
1562960	1575040	Well, let's bring, I mean, obviously it would be folly for me to sit here and try to talk
1575040	1581760	about San Francisco when you and our dungeon master spent all day really seeing the sights.
1581760	1583120	We hit all the sites.
1583120	1585920	Can we bring up Spencer Crittenden?
1585920	1587440	Spencer.
1587440	1593560	Oh my God, he's running.
1593560	1596000	He always runs.
1596000	1598000	Wow.
1598000	1601240	Hey, hey guys.
1601240	1602240	He ran.
1602240	1603240	He ran up here.
1603240	1604240	I'm really.
1604240	1609240	So Spencer, you and AG, you guys got here hours before I did and you guys really saw
1609240	1611340	the real San Francisco.
1611340	1613680	We saw the realest man.
1613680	1617100	We found the finest little, little lunch nook.
1617100	1618100	It was called out.
1618100	1619100	What did they call it?
1619100	1620100	Chipotle.
1620100	1621100	Chipotle.
1621100	1625580	Real down cuisine.
1625580	1630860	And then got drinks at Starbucks afterwards and then dessert at Cold Stone Creamery.
1630860	1632580	This isn't a joke.
1632580	1634700	That's exactly what they did every day.
1634700	1641220	All these fine artisanal craftsmen, everything we could have done in Los Angeles in the airport
1642220	1649220	was just really soaking in the culture.
1649220	1650220	Yeah.
1650220	1655220	But you guys partook so much, Spencer, you got a little sick, right?
1655220	1660300	I mean, I don't have a great stomach before Harmon town shows.
1660300	1662540	It's documented fact.
1662540	1663980	You still get a little queasy.
1663980	1664980	Oh yeah.
1664980	1665980	From superstar-itis.
1665980	1670240	No, that's not why.
1670240	1671280	What is it, Spencer?
1671280	1673680	It's just not superstar-itis.
1673680	1674680	Yeah.
1674680	1679240	Well, can you counter that with something that it is?
1679240	1680240	Anxiety.
1680240	1681240	No, anxiety.
1681240	1683240	That's the one.
1683240	1686240	Do you puke?
1686240	1688000	No, no.
1688000	1692800	I probably will.
1692800	1693800	Someday?
1693800	1697800	I mean, in a couple of minutes, it'll be fine.
1697800	1699800	He'll just get this guy.
1699800	1701800	He knows.
1701800	1703000	He knows.
1703000	1704000	Yeah.
1704000	1706520	You know, last time we were in San Francisco, me and Agee hung out.
1706520	1711480	It was like the first time I had really talked to the guy in person, I think, and we hung
1711480	1712480	out and got pizzas.
1712480	1713480	It was good times.
1713480	1714480	Yeah.
1714480	1723200	We went to Domino's and then got an authentic slice and got drinks at a 7-11.
1723200	1726160	You guys make a good pair.
1726160	1730800	I would be comfortable trusting a murder case to the two of you.
1730800	1736560	I don't know if it would get solved, but I would like to watch you try to solve it.
1736560	1738200	So comical.
1738200	1742760	It would all be centered around how we just see clues that are higher up than everyone
1742760	1743760	else can see.
1743760	1749760	Just be like, oh, actually, on top of the door jam, there's fingerprints.
1749760	1755600	Or we'd find clues in food, like bite into a hamburger with a ring in it.
1755600	1758480	McDonald's usually doesn't have these kinds of additives.
1758480	1764200	It's 100% beef seasoned with salt and pepper during cooking.
1764200	1768200	They told me that on their Twitter account today.
1768200	1769200	Did they tweet at you?
1769200	1773120	Yeah, because they were like, 100% beef in every patty.
1773120	1776280	I'm like, you put salt and pepper in it.
1776280	1777280	There's grease in it.
1777280	1778960	Those things aren't beef.
1778960	1785160	You can't say it's 100% beef if there's things that aren't beef comprising 100% of the object.
1786160	1788360	And then they were like, it is 100% beef.
1788360	1789640	We just add these things.
1789640	1793160	And I was like, that doesn't refute my point at all.
1807160	1813000	Was it San Francisco we were at, was Sketchfest, where that guy, was that where the...
1813480	1818200	No, Sketchfest was here, sure, but that's not necessarily where this guy was.
1818200	1819200	Calm down.
1819200	1825520	Well, you see in Francisco podcast listeners, was it where the guy that said he broke up
1825520	1833600	with his girlfriend and then there was the girl in the audience was like, he's a liar.
1833600	1834720	I don't remember that.
1834720	1835720	It was insane.
1835720	1838520	It was so titillating and weird.
1838520	1842560	It was just like one guy going like, I got dumped by this girl and I'm totally broken
1842560	1843560	hearted.
1843560	1847960	And then just like two minutes into it, you just keep hearing, liar, liar.
1847960	1849920	By the girl he supposedly broke up with.
1849920	1853520	No, just a stranger, but not a stranger.
1853520	1857320	Somebody who then came up and said, I think she was a barista at a place that he frequents
1857320	1859960	and she says, he's a character at our place.
1859960	1867680	And he says, I think her beef was that he's kind of a dramatic personality and that he's
1867680	1871160	always talking about this girl leaving him, but she's never seen him.
1871160	1873160	I really couldn't figure out what the hell was going on.
1873160	1877200	It was like, it was very interesting how it fed on the human compulsion to like figure
1877200	1882040	out what's right and what's wrong, what's just and what's, what's unjust.
1882040	1884320	It was like, uh, what is that?
1884320	1885440	The Maury show.
1885440	1892880	But if everyone was just guessing instead of actually having, you are probably not the
1892880	1894880	father Spencer.
1894880	1900200	I thought maybe it's that kind of amazing about our species that you can put us in a
1900200	1905080	situation where there's absolutely nothing at stake, but someone's saying bad person.
1905080	1907840	And then the other person was like, no good person.
1907840	1909080	And it kind of draws you in.
1909080	1914440	You're like, Oh, I'm going to figure this out because the objective truth is who gives
1914440	1915440	a shit?
1915440	1918600	Like, like, but the answer is all of us, cause we're all chimpanzees.
1918600	1920120	We're all like, we got to figure this out.
1920120	1924440	We got to, we got to, I guess like our instinct is we got to figure out which of these chimps
1924440	1926360	is, is, is the bad person.
1926360	1931840	And we got to like, we got to deny them further figs and bananas and send them into the forest
1931840	1936080	where they will die and stop contributing reproductively to the species.
1936080	1937600	That's what's in our, that's what's in our gut.
1937600	1942520	I guess is when we, when we tweet and hashtag and things we're like, we're trying to expunge,
1942520	1944120	uh, injustice.
1944120	1948800	We want to, we want to create a good, a good monkey species and like get rid of the bad
1948800	1949800	people.
1949800	1952400	I love that she was just like liar.
1952400	1955680	In my head, I, even if I knew I'd be in the back of the room going, that guy's a fucking
1955680	1957320	liar to my friend.
1957320	1958600	I wouldn't say it out loud.
1958600	1959600	Yeah.
1959600	1963240	It was really, from my perspective, it was absolutely impossible to tell which of them
1963240	1968200	was a hero or a villain and, and, and who, what's that?
1968200	1969200	Oh yeah.
1969200	1973960	Is it, are you just, is that just your objective opinion or okay?
1973960	1980360	Cause if he had insider information, boom, boom, we create our own little gamer gate
1980360	1986400	right here in San Francisco, trying to unravel that, that, that shit, uh, uh, yeah, I don't
1986400	1987400	know.
1987400	1992280	I, well I, yeah, I was, uh, I'm up here and I, sometimes I'm seeing things through a fog.
1992280	1996560	Uh, all right, well let's, why don't we meet some San Franciscans, huh?
1996560	1997560	Oh, I'd love to.
1997560	2000560	We should, we should get to the bottom of them as people.
2000560	2002560	Should we find some people who are hurting tonight?
2002560	2003560	Do we follow the pain?
2003560	2004560	I don't know what else to follow.
2004560	2006560	Follow the pain or the, the...
2006560	2007560	Can't follow the joy.
2007560	2008560	Yeah.
2008560	2009560	Let's try, let's try to follow the joy.
2009560	2010560	Okay.
2010560	2011560	Let's see.
2011560	2023880	Is there, who, who that is coincidentally within reach of my microphone cord feels like
2023880	2030440	they're, like, they're kind of, they're kind of so high, uh, on, uh, uh, in terms of biorhythmic
2030440	2033920	victories that they're waiting for the other shoe to drop.
2033920	2037280	Like they're actually kind of nervous that they're going to jinx it by bragging.
2037280	2039160	There's a handbag there waving back and forth.
2039760	2043160	Let's just take a flyer and you come down because I can't, I can't reach back there.
2043160	2044160	So we'll just trust you.
2051160	2052160	Is that right?
2052160	2053160	What's going on?
2053160	2056760	Let's, let's, it feels too Q and A-ish for him to be standing down there.
2056760	2057760	Can you climb up here?
2057760	2059760	Sit on the other, oh yeah, there's a seat up here.
2065760	2066760	What's your name young man?
2066760	2067760	Shane.
2067760	2068760	Shane?
2068760	2069760	Shame?
2069760	2070760	Yep.
2070760	2071760	Jesus.
2071760	2072760	Shame.
2072760	2073760	All right.
2073760	2074760	Uh, here you grab that.
2074760	2075760	I'll move.
2075760	2076760	I'll move the.
2076760	2077760	Following the joy.
2077760	2078760	I'll move the bottle.
2078760	2079760	Yeah.
2079760	2080760	You're following the shame.
2080760	2081760	Yes.
2081760	2082760	If your parents name you shame, yeah, they're kind of.
2082760	2083760	Yeah.
2083760	2084760	He means life in Hebrew.
2084760	2085760	Oh, really?
2085760	2086760	Yeah.
2086760	2087760	C-H-A-I-M.
2087760	2088760	Shame means life in Hebrew.
2088760	2089760	I am.
2089760	2090760	That's, that's the pronunciation.
2090760	2091760	Oh, oh.
2091760	2092760	Hi-am.
2092760	2093760	Yeah.
2093760	2094760	I'm not just a cool guy.
2094760	2095760	So a shame.
2095760	2097760	Oh, so you just, you're just pronouncing it like the way, uh, we, we, when we made up the
2097760	2098760	sandwich.
2098760	2099760	Exactly.
2099760	2100760	So many people.
2100760	2101760	It's an Americanization.
2101760	2104760	So many people say it wrong, but I just say shame, so it makes, it makes it everything
2104760	2105760	good.
2105760	2106760	All right.
2106760	2107760	Shame.
2107760	2108760	Hi-am.
2108760	2110320	Uh, what, what you're, you're, you're feeling, you're feeling, uh, on top of things right
2110320	2111320	now.
2111320	2112320	Oh yeah.
2112320	2115960	I'm, I'm literally high and, uh, I'm, uh, here to see you.
2115960	2116960	So I'm really good.
2116960	2117960	Oh.
2117960	2118960	And now I'm on stage.
2118960	2120720	So this is what I've been talking about with my friends.
2120720	2123160	I told them that I was going to come up here because I'm black.
2123160	2124160	Oh.
2124160	2125960	And that's bad reason.
2125960	2127760	And that's actually not why we brought him up here.
2127760	2129760	I can tell he was black when he was raving.
2129760	2134800	I was like, I was like, yeah, I'll take, I'll take the, I'll take the black guy.
2134800	2139680	I was going to yell out a white guilt, but I didn't, I didn't need to.
2139680	2146880	I kind of, I get, I get a high off of, of black people and I'll, I, I, I, I, I suck stem
2146880	2152400	cells out of, uh, out of, out of the blackness and I use it to like revitalize my whiteness.
2152400	2155840	I knew I was winning when I walked in this room and I was being black.
2155840	2156840	Okay.
2156840	2157840	Definitely.
2157840	2162680	Um, so, uh, so what's it like being black with a Jewish name?
2162680	2166520	And uh, no, the, uh, what, what do you, what do you just, let's just get to know you.
2166520	2170040	What do you, uh, what, how, can we ask how old are you are?
2170040	2171040	You seem 23.
2171040	2172040	Okay.
2172040	2173040	Right.
2173040	2174040	Yeah.
2174040	2175040	Just turned 23 in June.
2175040	2176040	We can still ask that.
2176040	2177040	Yeah.
2177040	2178040	So that means I can, uh, drink vodka whenever I want to.
2178040	2179040	Oh yeah.
2179040	2180040	You can have it.
2180040	2181040	You want to drink?
2181040	2182040	Hint, hint.
2182040	2184040	Wink, wink, right?
2184040	2185040	Yeah.
2185040	2186040	You shouldn't have to ask.
2186040	2187040	I'm sorry.
2187040	2188040	Here.
2188040	2189040	I don't want to dig here.
2189040	2190040	All right.
2190040	2191040	I'll do that.
2191040	2192040	I don't want to dig, man.
2192040	2196280	Harmon hand juice would be awesome to eat a untweetable.
2196280	2197280	Right.
2197280	2198280	Appreciate it.
2198280	2199280	Appreciate it.
2199280	2200280	I'm drinking kettle one.
2200280	2210280	You guys on the podcast, he's you, uh, to, oh, to you.
2210280	2211280	Oh, thanks.
2211280	2212280	Thanks.
2212280	2213280	Thanks.
2213280	2214280	You're on the podcast.
2214280	2217840	Uh, the, uh, so what do you, what do you, what's your, I would ask what you do, but
2217840	2218840	you're 23.
2218840	2222600	So you, I work, uh, two full-time jobs and one part-time job right now.
2222600	2223600	All right.
2223600	2224600	Run down the run down them.
2224600	2226680	Uh, I work at Panera bread as a baker.
2226680	2230000	Um, I actually have to go in a couple hours at midnight.
2230000	2234680	Um, and then I work at, um, a grocery store during the day and then I, um, I help out
2234680	2239560	at a garden, uh, a church garden for my grandmother, a church garden for your grandmother.
2239560	2247680	You just, you just, uh, cashed a sex check with every single woman in the room.
2247680	2251560	That's like San Francisco, uh, at least with every grandmother in the room.
2251560	2252560	Oh yeah.
2252560	2253560	Adorable.
2253560	2259560	Are you, are you, are you, can we ask about your sexual preference?
2259560	2260560	Oh yes.
2260560	2261560	I love women.
2261560	2262560	My, my girlfriend is in the audience.
2262560	2263560	Oh God.
2263560	2264560	It's girlfriend's hair.
2264560	2265560	Okay.
2265560	2266560	Crystal Cooper.
2266560	2267560	I love you baby.
2267560	2274520	Ignore the fact that the, the shame Haim is, uh, it works part-time in a garden for his
2274520	2275520	grandma.
2275520	2276520	Yeah.
2276520	2281000	Cause my underwear got a little wet when you said that nice, nice, nice, it's very sexy.
2281000	2282000	Can I see?
2282000	2283000	No.
2283000	2287200	It came out the wrong end.
2287200	2295040	Um, so how do you, how do you juggle all that stuff?
2295040	2298160	Did you put a loaf of bread in the oven at the bakery and then you cut, came here and
2298160	2303320	you're like, I wish I go in from midnight to eight.
2303320	2307960	So then, uh, and then, uh, I turn around and go from nine 30 to six at my other job.
2307960	2309560	So I work all, I'll work all day on Friday.
2309560	2310560	It doesn't make any sense.
2310560	2311560	Are you on speed?
2311560	2316400	Um, just a lot of weed.
2316400	2317400	When do you sleep?
2317400	2318400	You said midnight to eight.
2318400	2321640	I had an off day, um, at my second job today.
2321640	2325720	So I slept from like a 10 to about two when my homie called me to come up here.
2325720	2327320	I've been here since four 30.
2327320	2328320	Jesus Christ.
2328320	2334520	Can we, I was the first person in line.
2334520	2336200	Are you a San Francisco native?
2336200	2337600	I am a Oakland native.
2337600	2345960	Oh, Dan, uh, since I'm up here in Oakland, we say, can I get, can I get a Yee?
2345960	2346960	Yee.
2346960	2347960	Yee.
2347960	2348960	Yee.
2348960	2351160	I feel like I'm in a morning zoo show or something.
2351160	2352160	Yee.
2352160	2354280	Dan, Dan, can we get a rap about the pinch of the pump?
2354280	2356720	Oh, we can rap together all day long.
2356720	2357720	Oh, is there?
2357720	2358720	Oh, I love that.
2358720	2359720	My goodness.
2359720	2360720	I didn't want to bring it up first.
2360720	2361720	Let's, let's rap about it.
2361720	2362720	Let's rap about it.
2362720	2367280	It would have been racist of me to be the one to bring it up.
2367280	2369280	Would you like to rap with me, young man?
2369280	2370280	That's what I wanted to tell you.
2370280	2371280	That's what I wanted to tell you.
2371280	2372960	Saying N word is not racist.
2372960	2375400	It's like the best thing I've ever heard in my life.
2375400	2378040	In rap form with the, period, period.
2378480	2380480	Hey, N word, that's hilarious to me.
2380480	2382400	Like, it does not offend me whatsoever.
2382400	2385560	Well, I don't, I mean, it, I'm sure, yeah, that's up to you.
2385560	2387680	You, you get to make the choice of what offends you.
2387680	2388680	Fuck those guys.
2388680	2390680	What do you mean those guys?
2390680	2395600	Whoever has a problem, black people, fuck black people.
2395600	2401160	I say, I say it, I say it so, I say it so much, like, like to, but I never, I don't,
2401160	2404760	I wouldn't say it to my black friends because it's like, it's, that's racist.
2404760	2407560	Well, it, it kind of is, it is.
2407560	2410760	That's the problem is it puts up a wall because it's like, there is things I'm saying, it's
2410760	2416440	like now I, now I am, it's actual technical discrimination by the, by the actual definition
2416440	2417440	of the word.
2417440	2418440	Because you're not calling it N word.
2418440	2419440	Well, because I'm, yeah, exactly.
2419440	2422480	Like I'm not, so it's either like, I have to stop doing this thing that makes, that's
2422480	2426840	really fun because it's like this fun, amazing, cultural, powerful thing.
2426840	2428680	It's like, it was a really great word.
2428680	2429680	It's like super califragilistic.
2429680	2435080	Yeah, it's the best, it's the, when I heard it, I was just like, N word, yeah.
2435080	2438880	So I'm like, when I'm making a sandwich, I'm like, yeah, this N word needs some mustard
2438880	2444240	and the N word on the brain, but, but I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna say, I would not
2444240	2449440	subject any of my, uh, African American friends.
2449440	2450440	That's how I say it.
2450440	2451440	Cause I'm so liberal.
2451440	2452440	That's also righteous.
2452440	2457080	Uh, the, I wouldn't subject them to that social pressure because then if I, if I would say
2457080	2462080	something like that, then they have to go, they're like, okay, now I'm, now I'm a representative
2462080	2463080	of something.
2464080	2465720	No, you're overthinking it.
2465720	2466720	You're overthinking it.
2466720	2467720	I have to overthink it.
2467720	2468720	Oh, of course.
2468720	2469720	You have to.
2469720	2470720	It's my job as a white man.
2470720	2471720	Yeah.
2471720	2472720	White guilt.
2472720	2473720	It goes back to that.
2473720	2474720	Yeah.
2474720	2475720	I will end racism.
2475720	2476720	I began it.
2476720	2479000	I'll take care of it.
2479000	2480000	Don't worry.
2480000	2481000	It'll be fine.
2481000	2483760	Clean up in aisle three.
2483760	2485160	It's as simple as that.
2485160	2489920	Uh, well, how do we do, do, do, so, so are we both, I kind of like the idea of like,
2489920	2494760	we find somebody else in San Francisco that can, that can bust a good beat, beat boxers
2494760	2496360	and then you and I just trade off.
2496360	2497360	Oh yeah.
2497360	2498360	We're good.
2498360	2499360	We're like a team.
2499360	2500360	Yeah.
2500360	2501360	Dustin's also got the beats down there.
2501360	2502360	Oh, you have beats?
2502360	2503360	Oh, okay.
2503360	2504360	Fuck it.
2504360	2505360	Spencer.
2505360	2506360	How you doing, man?
2506360	2507360	I'd say play that shit.
2507360	2508360	I'm fucked up, man.
2508360	2509360	Yeah.
2509360	2510360	I feel you.
2510360	2511360	Yeah.
2511360	2512360	I feel you.
2512360	2513360	You got any of that Bay Area weed yet?
2513360	2514360	No.
2514360	2515360	Wait, what?
2515360	2516360	No.
2516360	2517360	Oh man.
2517360	2518360	Fuck me after.
2518360	2519360	Uh oh.
2520240	2531100	Fuck your mother, fuck your mom, fuck your mom, fuck your mom, real good.
2531100	2535060	Fuck your mama, real good.
2535060	2538280	Fuck your model, real good.
2538280	2541260	Get them dead.
2541260	2546220	Yo, yo, yo, yo, Sam Francis.
2546220	2547220	Go.
2547220	2548220	Yo, yo.
2548220	2549220	Took a cable car to your mama's house.
2549220	2554860	Hit like a mouse, it went inside the hole, and it wouldn't come out, and then after
2554860	2560500	a while, I put it back in her mouth.
2560500	2561500	No new taxes.
2561500	2562500	No new taxes.
2562500	2563500	No new, no new taxes.
2563500	2564500	No new, no new taxes.
2564500	2565500	No new, no new taxes.
2565500	2566500	No new.
2566500	2574540	Bay Area, comin' on strong, I fucked your mama like I was short and long.
2574540	2577260	I did it in the summer and fall.
2577260	2581900	I fucked your mama, but it didn't matter at all.
2581900	2587300	San Francisco, San Francisco, San Francisco.
2587300	2588300	Alcatraz.
2588300	2589300	What?
2589300	2590300	Oh shit.
2590300	2596300	We fucked your money, ladies and gentlemen.
2596300	2597300	Vincent Price, Vincent Price.
2597300	2606380	Deep in the bowels of your mother's vagina, comes Dan Harmon.
2606380	2617180	We fucked your mama on a Monday, we fucked your mama on a Tuesday, on a Wednesday.
2617180	2620620	Every day of the week, she's gettin' it deep.
2620620	2623980	All right, all right, all right.
2623980	2624980	We wrapped.
2624980	2625980	Yeah.
2625980	2626980	Yeah.
2626980	2627980	Yeah.
2627980	2628980	Shame.
2628980	2632580	Shout out to Pat.
2632580	2633580	Shame wrapped.
2633580	2635460	That was awesome.
2635460	2637020	That music was so intense.
2637020	2638020	Yeah, what was that?
2638020	2639020	Where did that guy go?
2639020	2640020	That was really...
2640020	2641020	How do we...
2641020	2642020	Fight club?
2642020	2643020	Oh, it's the Fight Club show.
2643020	2645020	Yeah, we should've just beat each other's asses.
2645020	2648180	It's been a long time since you wrapped.
2648180	2649180	Yeah.
2649180	2652220	Yeah, that's why I wanted to make him do it.
2652220	2653500	I was like gettin' on a bike.
2653500	2654900	It felt misogynistic now, though.
2654900	2655900	It feels like I...
2655900	2656900	Wow.
2656900	2658660	I don't know, it feels like the world's changing underneath her feet, and it's like I started
2658660	2663020	by fuckin' mamas, and now I have this filter in my head that's like, you put your dick
2663020	2665500	in her mouth, like...
2665500	2666500	Give her some agency.
2666500	2669160	But mothers like to be fucked, though.
2669160	2670160	It doesn't pass the...
2670160	2671260	What's the Bechtel test?
2671260	2672260	What's the...
2672260	2675740	I don't think any male female...
2675740	2681340	I want to rap now about how your mama chose to fuck me.
2681340	2683460	That still doesn't pass the Bechtel test.
2683460	2684460	Yeah.
2684460	2685580	No, it's true, it's true.
2685580	2687420	Your mama was at the store.
2687420	2690260	She had a nice flower with her friend.
2690260	2691500	Bring the B bag.
2691500	2692500	That's it, that's Bechtel.
2692980	2693980	Oh.
2693980	2694980	Bechtel.
2694980	2695980	You got this, Bechtel.
2695980	2698980	A flower with her friend.
2698980	2699980	Yeah.
2699980	2703980	A flower with her friend.
2703980	2704980	Flower.
2704980	2705980	Friend.
2705980	2706980	Friend.
2706980	2717380	Yo, yo, your mama went out and had a nice day, got together with some friends in a feminine
2717380	2718380	way.
2718380	2719380	Uh-oh.
2719380	2721460	They weren't defined by their gender at all.
2721460	2722460	Nope.
2722460	2726220	They went and tried some things at the ball.
2726220	2730020	But not in an elegant Cinderella way.
2730020	2735340	It was more like just a ball for people, okay?
2735340	2737340	It wasn't like people were twirling and...
2737340	2738340	Yo, yo, yo.
2738340	2739340	Yo, mama fuck dust.
2739340	2740340	Yo, mama fuck dust.
2740340	2743340	Yo, mama, yo, mama, yo, mama, fuck dust.
2743340	2750940	Well, she did later, but this is the story about how before that she was an activated
2750940	2751940	woman.
2752940	2757300	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
2757300	2761300	Your mama woke up at 10 and said, I need some food.
2761300	2764460	She ate some crackers and was in a good mood.
2764460	2765460	Oh, this is good.
2765460	2768020	She got in her Prius and drove to the mall.
2768020	2769020	No sale.
2769020	2771620	She said, I'm not defined by my gender at all.
2771620	2772620	I'm a woman.
2772620	2775300	Your mama had a good time with her friends.
2775300	2779020	She drove from the south to the other end.
2779020	2781360	The north.
2781360	2792800	She did some job interviews and every boss she met was refused to see her as a person.
2792800	2795320	So she refused to work there.
2795320	2796320	Yeah.
2796320	2799320	And she started her own business.
2799320	2800320	Entrepreneurship.
2800320	2801320	On Google...
2801320	2802320	Fuck the corporations.
2802320	2811320	I like that my idea of feminism is straight out of the movie Nine to Five.
2812320	2820160	I can't, you can't really, you can convince me to be a good person, but I will still,
2820160	2824600	I'm just Dabney Coleman.
2824600	2828720	And then she had her own little job.
2828720	2829720	Entrepreneurship is the way to go.
2829720	2831880	It's sure, well, I mean, we got no choice left.
2831880	2835600	We're not putting any money into education and then we're not treating the people that
2835600	2839200	get the pay for the educations like they're entitled to anything and we're not providing
2839200	2841040	daycare and we're not providing medical care.
2841560	2846800	So we better reward entrepreneurship or rather I should say everybody should go be an entrepreneur.
2846800	2851800	Who's that guy that was offering like, he'll give you $10,000 if you drop out of college
2851800	2852800	because he was like a...
2852800	2854800	Oh yeah, I think he had $10,000 then.
2854800	2856800	That was an episode of Silicon Valley.
2856800	2860640	It sounds like something maybe Rupert Murdoch would do, yeah.
2860640	2863440	I'll give you $10,000 if you drop out of college.
2863440	2865040	I hate to find him.
2865040	2868800	It was like some guy who early adopted eBay stock or something like that.
2869800	2870800	All right.
2871800	2873800	All I hear is electric eel.
2875800	2878800	You guys see that documentary about the student debt and stuff like that?
2878800	2880800	It's a pretty interesting documentary.
2880800	2881800	I can't remember what it's called.
2881800	2882800	Aaron was watching it.
2882800	2883800	It's fucked up, man.
2883800	2884800	Ivory Tower?
2885800	2886800	Ivory Tower?
2887800	2888800	That I heard.
2889800	2890800	That's because one person was talking.
2890800	2891800	Because they're real words.
2891800	2892800	That guy's name is like...
2892800	2893800	Shame is like...
2897800	2898800	Say Harry Potter.
2898800	2900800	I'll understand it, motherfucker.
2902800	2903800	Shit.
2904800	2905800	All right.
2905800	2906800	So, shame.
2906800	2909800	I always lose track of time on these foreign gigs.
2909800	2910800	Foreign?
2911800	2913800	We're jet lagged and we don't know how long we've been here.
2913800	2916800	We're not jet lagged for 40 minutes.
2916800	2917800	40 minutes?
2917800	2918800	40 minutes?
2920800	2921800	To a foreign land.
2922800	2930800	You flew over Google Mountain and landed in the land of clam chowder bread bowls.
2931800	2932800	All right.
2932800	2933800	So, shame.
2933800	2934800	Here's the elephant in the room, though.
2934800	2937800	You've got three jobs, two full-time, two part.
2937800	2938800	Yeah.
2939800	2942800	I hope the answer isn't you just wanted to be on stage.
2942800	2945800	I said, who's on top of the world right now?
2945800	2946800	Who's really...
2947800	2950800	It's a little bit of both me just wanting to be on stage.
2950800	2953800	Like I told you, I told my friends I'm going to get on stage because I'm black.
2953800	2959800	But I wanted to be on stage because I'm very happy right now, just for the simple fact.
2959800	2965800	I just saw your documentary and I gave you a handshake while I was waiting for the bathroom.
2965800	2966800	Oh, I remember, yeah.
2966800	2968800	And now I'm on the stage drinking vodka with you.
2968800	2970800	This is a dream come true right now.
2970800	2971800	That just puts all this pressure on me.
2971800	2972800	I thought, okay.
2972800	2973800	All right.
2973800	2974800	Well, I'm glad I...
2974800	2975800	Oh, yeah.
2975800	2976800	No pressure on you, Dan.
2976800	2977800	Well, I want to...
2977800	2978800	Okay.
2978800	2980800	But will you stay here for a second?
2980800	2981800	Oh, definitely stay.
2981800	2982800	I'm not going anywhere.
2982800	2983800	Because I want to...
2983800	2984800	Actually, I'm going home with you.
2984800	2985800	You just adopted me.
2985800	2987800	Aaron, you're my mom now.
2987800	2988800	Well, we did it.
2988800	2991800	I want to try an experiment.
2991800	2994800	Who is miserable?
2996800	2997800	That hand went up fast.
2997800	2998800	That hand shot up a little.
2998800	2999800	Yeah.
2999800	3000800	You pointed at yourself.
3000800	3001800	Yeah.
3001800	3002800	Yeah.
3002800	3003800	You come up.
3003800	3004800	Okay.
3004800	3005800	Oh, my God.
3005800	3006800	Nice.
3006800	3007800	I want to see...
3007800	3010800	Maybe we can create some kind of human emotion battery.
3010800	3015800	If we put a wire between his mouth and yours, and then we can run a city on it or something?
3015800	3018800	It's like a human-sense iPad kind of thing.
3018800	3022800	However you think you can do it, just don't sue us if it goes wrong.
3022800	3023800	What's going on, man?
3023800	3024800	It's just not ideal.
3024800	3025800	Man, it sounds like you're having a good time.
3025800	3026800	Oh, yeah.
3026800	3027800	Your turn now.
3027800	3028800	Okay.
3028800	3029800	You take that.
3029800	3030800	What's your name, young man?
3030800	3031800	My name is Austin.
3031800	3032800	Austin?
3032800	3033800	Okay.
3033800	3034800	I'm from Germantown.
3034800	3035800	Wow.
3035800	3036800	Shame and Austin.
3036800	3037800	Okay.
3037800	3038800	That's my life.
3038800	3039800	True Detective, season two, right here.
3039800	3040800	Oh, wow.
3040800	3041800	I'm Matthew McConaughey.
3041800	3042800	That's fine.
3042800	3043800	All right.
3043800	3044800	Cool.
3044800	3045800	All right.
3045800	3048800	Do you want to be like 2006 Matthew McConaughey?
3048800	3050800	I'm like Failure to Launch Matthew McConaughey.
3050800	3051800	Wasn't he in that movie?
3051800	3052800	Yeah.
3052800	3053800	Yeah.
3053800	3054800	I'm that guy.
3054800	3056800	Isn't it Vince Vaughn and Colin Farrell this season?
3056800	3057800	I heard that.
3057800	3058800	Yes, it is.
3058800	3059800	I hope not.
3059800	3060800	It's a fucking...
3060800	3061800	God damn it.
3061800	3062800	Well, you don't...
3062800	3067280	Yeah, but if you heard McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, would you have been like...
3067280	3068280	No, because that's a...
3068280	3072600	I mean, when I hear Vince Vaughn, I have that same response to the McConaughey because it's
3072600	3073920	like Vince Vaughn is...
3073920	3074920	That's...
3074920	3075920	Yeah, I'll watch that.
3075920	3076920	Whatever happens.
3076920	3077920	That sounds interesting.
3077920	3078920	Yeah.
3078920	3079920	But Colin Farrell.
3079920	3080920	I don't know.
3080920	3081920	Sorry, Colin.
3081920	3082920	Yeah, you know what?
3082920	3083920	You're right.
3083920	3084920	You're right.
3084920	3085920	I'm trying to spit and polish it.
3085920	3086920	Yeah.
3086920	3087920	Vince Vaughn is that guy for you?
3087920	3088920	Really?
3088920	3090880	No, not because he's amazing, but because that's so fucking weird.
3090880	3093680	It's like, whatever happens, it's going to be interesting.
3093680	3101280	I didn't expect McConaughey to be all like, I'm in a Lincoln by a Lincoln or whatever,
3101280	3103760	but it was interesting to watch happen.
3103760	3107280	Oh, Vince Vaughn, I think he's just like, I don't know, man.
3107280	3110600	He just always looks so tired, so I just feel bad for him.
3110600	3111600	He puts in the hours.
3111600	3112600	Well, obviously.
3112600	3113600	He looks it.
3113600	3114600	Yeah, he needs a nap.
3114600	3115600	I don't know, man.
3115600	3118440	In this case, I feel like you would have to be Vince Vaughn because you don't ever sleep.
3118440	3119440	Yeah, I do need a nap.
3119440	3120440	Which is cool.
3120440	3121440	I'm Vince Vaughn.
3121440	3122440	So we're season two.
3122440	3123440	I'm Vince Vaughn.
3123440	3125280	Did you say Colin Farrell?
3125280	3127280	You have to be Colin Farrell?
3127280	3131120	We don't have to figure this out tonight.
3131120	3134240	The show opens in two hours.
3134240	3140200	The logistics are really tough, but like, you know, all right, Austin, why are you miserable?
3140200	3142280	There's a lot of reasons.
3142280	3143280	Top three.
3143280	3146280	Top three.
3146280	3150000	I was in a relationship for like six years that just ended maybe a month ago.
3151000	3153000	Me and Dan on the same page.
3153000	3154000	I knew it.
3154000	3156000	I knew it was coming.
3156000	3160200	Truth or truth or on that, it ended and that sucks.
3160200	3161200	Straight relationship.
3161200	3162200	Yeah.
3162200	3163200	Yeah.
3163200	3165200	The best kind.
3167200	3168200	Jesus.
3170200	3171200	Wow.
3171200	3172200	Wow.
3172200	3173200	That just sunk in.
3173200	3179800	I actually heard that is just being like kind of absurdly obtuse.
3180600	3184600	I was just random and then I just realized, oh, my God, that's horrible.
3184600	3185600	Yeah.
3187600	3191600	Well, you asked like that was important or somehow the answer bad.
3191600	3196800	I wanted to picture it and for and for reverse homophobic reasons, like I'm reverse racist
3196800	3199400	and reverse homophobic, which is equally probably bad.
3199400	3201400	You just love gay people so much you want everyone.
3201400	3205600	I thought in my head as I asked that I was like, why did you ask that?
3205600	3209600	And I realized the answer is if you were gay, it's more tragic.
3210600	3215000	It's more tragic when gay men break up than when a man just breaks up with a woman.
3215000	3215800	Sorry.
3215800	3217000	Way more emotional.
3217800	3219000	I don't know that it's true.
3219000	3221000	It's hard for them to find each other.
3221800	3222800	Facts.
3222800	3223800	Facts.
3224800	3228800	And if they can find each other and be in a relationship, it's a beautiful thing.
3228800	3230800	It's more beautiful than two straight people.
3230800	3232800	And if they break up, it's more tragic.
3233600	3234800	Thank you, San Francisco.
3234800	3239800	I may have to buy property here soon.
3239800	3241800	I just want to try to see if I can lower the house price.
3241800	3242800	You have to.
3242800	3244800	You have to because I live here and now you're my father.
3244800	3246800	So you have to have a house for me.
3247800	3248800	All right.
3248800	3249800	So so yeah, I just I don't know.
3249800	3251800	No, I just wanted a mental image.
3251800	3252800	I don't know.
3252800	3253800	I wanted to know if it's fine.
3253800	3258800	So so so a young lady, you broke it off six months ago.
3258800	3259800	So that's enough right there.
3259800	3260800	It was a six year relationship.
3260800	3262800	They ended about a month ago.
3262800	3263800	Okay.
3263800	3264800	I'm not speaking the time.
3264800	3265800	I don't listen.
3265800	3266800	It's cool.
3266800	3267800	It's fine.
3267800	3268800	I don't.
3268800	3269800	I don't expect you to.
3269800	3270800	I'm not.
3270800	3271800	Okay.
3271800	3272800	Not that important.
3272800	3273800	I'm going to try, though.
3273800	3274800	I don't.
3274800	3275800	There's that.
3275800	3276800	You're too fresh out.
3276800	3277800	Yeah.
3277800	3279800	I feel a little bad about number two because I feel like it should take more
3279800	3280800	precedence because it's been around longer.
3280800	3283800	But I don't really have like a relationship with my family who I live with
3283800	3285800	very like I have a huge family too.
3285800	3288800	I have like seven brothers and I'm right in the middle.
3288800	3292800	And I just don't I just don't have that relationship that people have with
3292800	3293800	their family.
3293800	3294800	And you live with all of them currently?
3294800	3295800	Not all of them currently.
3295800	3300800	One, one lives in San Diego, the San Francisco, San Francisco of California.
3300800	3306800	And one of them lives in Tacoma, Washington, the San Diego of Washington.
3306800	3307800	Yes.
3307800	3310800	And he's he just got back from Afghanistan in the army.
3310800	3313800	The the I got it.
3313800	3314800	I got it.
3314800	3315800	I got it.
3315800	3317800	The Portland of the Middle East.
3317800	3318800	Yeah.
3318800	3321800	Where were young people go to retire in the Middle East?
3321800	3324800	I would assume I don't I don't know.
3324800	3329800	And then my other brothers are one of them lives on like a fucking ranch or
3329800	3331800	something not far.
3331800	3333800	And then the rest of them are younger than me.
3333800	3335800	So they do in fact live with me.
3335800	3338800	But is the general thing like do you feel a little bit like you just like
3338800	3341800	there's something there's like a circuit broken in you or you're like wait,
3341800	3343800	why am I not like one of these people on TV where I'm kind of like
3343800	3345800	automatically enchanted by my family?
3345800	3346800	Yeah, totally.
3346800	3350800	I actually said that the other day when when me and my girlfriend were
3350800	3353800	breaking up, I said, why isn't everything like like a TV show?
3353800	3355800	I don't I don't get it.
3355800	3358800	I don't have that frame of reference that everyone has where it's like,
3358800	3360800	well, you know, it'll be cool.
3360800	3363800	I'm always just like, why don't I feel like I like I have that with anyone?
3363800	3365800	I'm fully qualified to diagnose you.
3365800	3366800	But I have one more question.
3366800	3367800	Be my guest.
3367800	3373800	Do you have a snow globe with the cast of an entire hospital drama inside of it?
3373800	3374800	Wow.
3374800	3377800	That is an old ass reference, dude.
3377800	3381800	That is an old, old ass reference.
3381800	3385800	I got my middle age San Franciscans are in the house.
3385800	3387800	Say it elsewhere.
3387800	3390800	Also, I think there's like then there's 30 percent trickle of people who just
3390800	3392800	know that as a reference.
3392800	3394800	Yeah, I feel like that's that's me.
3394800	3399800	It's kind of like I've never seen Gone with the Wind, but I know that he doesn't
3399800	3404800	give a damn about my deer or something.
3404800	3406800	I've never made it through Wizard of Oz.
3406800	3409800	But I know her shoes are red and she had them the whole time or something.
3409800	3413800	And the trees are monkeys.
3413800	3417800	Those are the hard plot points of that mostly.
3417800	3418800	The OK.
3418800	3422800	So but yeah, I mean, that's that's that is that's how I feel.
3422800	3423800	That scares me.
3423800	3426800	My mom and dad are not coming to my wedding.
3426800	3431800	And I feel like it's because something wrong with me because I like you just
3431800	3434800	finished watching a movie where, of course, is a big plot point in the movie
3434800	3436800	where I'm like, oh, my mom hit me and my dad spanked me.
3436800	3438800	And I think they're kind of sick of it.
3438800	3441800	I don't think they want to come to a wedding where like Joel McHale's there
3441800	3443800	and just watched a movie about how they hit me.
3443800	3447800	I think they're like I'm assuming all these things because they're very polite.
3447800	3450800	I would say reptilian, but they like they did.
3450800	3452800	They say why they know they didn't.
3452800	3454800	They just said, well, we can't make it.
3454800	3456800	We'd love to see pictures and we'll hook up soon.
3456800	3459800	And I was like, I just projected out of that silence.
3459800	3460800	I'm like, you know what?
3460800	3461800	They're just fucking sick of it.
3461800	3468800	I'm for they have a 41 year old child who is in his thirty fifth year of making money
3468800	3470800	by talking about how they beat him.
3470800	3472800	And they're like, I'm not going to that wedding.
3472800	3474800	It's going to be uncomfortable.
3474800	3478800	Jack Black's going to be like looking over at us and whispering.
3478800	3480800	Yeah.
3480800	3481800	Yeah, I wouldn't.
3481800	3484800	So I don't blame him, which makes me feel bad because it's like I know that I think
3484800	3485800	about my extended family.
3485800	3488800	It's like I don't I just I do nothing but fumble balls there.
3488800	3490800	Just out of like I don't care.
3490800	3491800	I don't care.
3491800	3495800	I have that exact the exact thing where like they try.
3495800	3497800	Well, I don't even know that they try to engage me genuinely.
3497800	3499800	But I just I don't I don't care.
3499800	3503800	I hold I hold family to the same standard to which I hold strangers.
3503800	3505800	And they don't they don't measure up.
3505800	3510800	They don't because they're like, you should come over for Christmas so that we can fight.
3510800	3511800	Yeah, no, exactly.
3511800	3515800	If a stranger offered that, I'd be like, fuck you.
3515800	3518800	Like if a TV show offered that, I'd be like, no, I'm not going to tune in to watch the
3518800	3520800	Christmas episode and see you fight.
3520800	3521800	Well, that is what we do.
3521800	3525800	But but but but like, yeah, I just kind of like, I don't know.
3525800	3527800	I think I think it's yeah, I don't know.
3527800	3528800	I don't know what it is.
3528800	3529800	It makes me feel bad.
3529800	3530800	It makes me feel like I'm a shitty person.
3530800	3531800	No, yeah, I get that.
3531800	3534800	It makes me feel fucking you worried that the chickens are going to come home to roost.
3534800	3539800	You're going to be 70 in the Stanley Kubrick third act bed with the tubes in your nose.
3539800	3544800	And you're going to be like, where everyone where is everyone?
3544800	3547800	And they're going to be like, we're gone because you didn't care.
3547800	3549800	You articulate that really well.
3549800	3550800	Yeah.
3550800	3554800	You should tell them McKenna's solution to your parents not coming to your.
3554800	3555800	Oh, yeah.
3555800	3560800	He wants me to hire actors to play my parents, which I think is really interesting.
3560800	3561800	Like have Tom.
3561800	3562800	It's doable.
3562800	3563800	It's doable in Los Angeles.
3563800	3567800	It is totally like you could get you could go to central casting and just have like people
3567800	3568800	that just look like your dad.
3568800	3569800	But also, I have a crack.
3569800	3571800	I could maybe get, you know, who knows?
3571800	3576800	I could see if like Tom Scarritt or Bryan Cranston would like, you know, like, like,
3576800	3579800	like, like, like maybe get an A-list guy to be my dad.
3579800	3580800	Organ free.
3580800	3581800	God free.
3581800	3584800	Can Gilbert God free to fly out and be your dad?
3584800	3590800	I am so proud of my dad and my son just yesterday.
3590800	3593800	I'm supposed to say something.
3593800	3595800	Now Harmon's in session.
3595800	3596800	Danny, treat it.
3596800	3597800	That's a good.
3597800	3599800	You do a good Gilbert.
3600800	3601800	He's a hero of mine.
3601800	3602800	I haven't talked about this yet.
3602800	3605800	I don't know if it's appropriate to talk about it because I don't know the guy.
3605800	3606800	And I don't know.
3606800	3610400	Like when I was backstage, I met him and I was like, hey, I have such an honor to have
3610400	3611400	you here.
3611400	3612400	So great that you were here.
3612400	3613400	And he's like, OK.
3613400	3617400	And I go like, actually, you're not so much a guest as you are actually kind of like you
3617400	3618800	have to go out and introduce me.
3618800	3619800	OK.
3619800	3621800	And he just kept saying, OK.
3621800	3624300	And I was like, oh, God, I really fucked up.
3624300	3625300	Like he doesn't know me.
3625300	3626300	And he doesn't.
3626300	3627500	This is too much to ask of somebody.
3627500	3630500	He's bummed out and he's lethargic and he doesn't care.
3630500	3633000	And he just kept going, OK.
3633000	3636000	And then and then and then he kind of like I didn't feel like I had the right to tell
3636000	3637000	him to go out.
3637000	3641000	And so you can hear in the recording, people are spontaneously erupting into chicken noodle
3641000	3645000	songs because I'm backstage like standing next to him and kind of waiting for him to
3645000	3646000	go out.
3646000	3647000	Yeah.
3647000	3648000	And but afraid to ask him to go out.
3648000	3650500	So then I was like, OK, so let's go do it.
3650500	3653500	And then he comes out and he just he starts like pumping.
3653500	3658000	He just like comes out, completely changes his posture, turns into this completely different
3658000	3659000	person.
3659000	3660000	And the audience is like screaming for him.
3660000	3661000	And he's like milking the crowd.
3661000	3664000	And then he sits down and goes like, I'm Joe Gilbert Gottfried.
3664000	3665500	And it does this whole thing.
3665500	3666500	Does it for two hours.
3666500	3667500	It's a great show.
3667500	3669500	We get off stage and I'm like, oh, my God, that was so great.
3669500	3670500	Thank you.
3670500	3671500	He's like, OK.
3671500	3674500	And then he disappeared into the night like Starman.
3674500	3682000	He just he just turned into cosmic dust and went up and that's where Saturn's rings come
3683000	3684000	from.
3684000	3685000	He's a lights up performer.
3685000	3686000	That's what they call it.
3686000	3690000	What I really wanted to ask him is, is that like because we're friends with Bobcat.
3690000	3695000	So we know that Bobcat thinks of that voice that he would do like, you know, that guy.
3695000	3696000	That's a character.
3696000	3701000	And I and I didn't I don't know Gilbert Gottfried well enough to ask him.
3701000	3707000	I wanted to ask him is that do you call that a character or is that how you speak when
3707000	3709000	you're projecting your voice?
3709000	3711500	Yeah, because I think there's a subtle but important difference.
3711500	3715000	Like I really wanted to know, but I didn't have the balls to ask him.
3715000	3718000	And I thought I'd share just what's going on in my life.
3718000	3721000	The lowest stakes.
3721000	3722000	Wow.
3722000	3723000	You got to hear the San Francisco show.
3723000	3727000	Dan talks about the previous show.
3727000	3730500	He really gets to the bottom of nothing.
3730500	3734000	Just asks questions and puts things he he remembers.
3734000	3736000	He needs butter.
3736000	3739000	It was a great use of San Francisco's time.
3739000	3744000	We watched a two hour movie about him and then he and then we watched him think about
3744000	3745000	things.
3745000	3746000	So how do we.
3746000	3747000	All right.
3747000	3748000	What do we do here?
3748000	3750000	We got misery and we got company.
3750000	3751000	Shame.
3751000	3753000	Totally illogical happiness.
3753000	3757000	Shame's part illogical happiness.
3757000	3760000	Anybody that anybody that's shoveling bread.
3760000	3761000	He said he was hot.
3761000	3763000	How they make bread.
3763000	3766000	We shovel out of dirt.
3766000	3767000	Come to Panera bread guys.
3767000	3769000	We shovel it out of dirt.
3769000	3771000	I face everything on Minecraft.
3771000	3772000	That's how you make bread in Minecraft.
3772000	3776000	You get the get you know you have to.
3776000	3780000	The I mean you know you got lots to complain about shame.
3780000	3782000	I have a hell of a lot to complain about.
3782000	3783000	But you got a girlfriend.
3783000	3785000	Maybe you have a girlfriend.
3785000	3786000	That's the big key.
3786000	3787000	I want to have a girlfriend.
3787000	3788000	I complain still.
3788000	3789000	So that's what it is.
3789000	3791000	It's the women in our lives.
3791000	3792000	It's the women.
3792000	3793000	It's it's it's the loan.
3793000	3796000	It's the one you don't feel like you have somebody to share your life with.
3796000	3797000	Right Spencer.
3797000	3798000	Oh man.
3798000	3803000	I woke up at like four in the morning because I had a nightmare about a giant dog sized
3803000	3804000	spider.
3804000	3808000	And then I went back to sleep and had a nightmare where my ex came back and then like disappeared
3808000	3809000	like a ghost.
3809000	3811000	And then I couldn't get back to sleep.
3811000	3813000	Which one was scarier.
3813000	3816000	The spider was scarier in terms of shitty.
3816000	3821000	I think I could have probably handled the spider a bit better.
3821000	3822000	Jesus Christ.
3822000	3826000	The trick is to quickly snap off one or two limbs.
3826000	3834000	And from there it's just easy pickings when it comes to monstrous spiders.
3834000	3836000	Spencer how would you fight a unicorn?
3836000	3838000	Oh you don't fight a unicorn.
3838000	3844000	You just don't enter their sacred forest in the first place.
3844000	3846000	That's kind of a cop out answer.
3846000	3848000	What if you found yourself in it.
3848000	3850000	What if you were drugged and woke up in their sacred forest.
3850000	3851000	That's not a unicorn.
3851000	3856000	That would be some sort of doppelganger trick.
3856000	3857000	What about a Keebler elf.
3857000	3858000	You know what Keebler elves are.
3858000	3859000	Yeah.
3859000	3860000	They make cookies.
3860000	3861000	They make cookies.
3861000	3862000	Yeah.
3862000	3863000	How would you fight three of those.
3863000	3869000	The same way you'd fight any three infants I guess.
3869000	3870000	Infants.
3871000	3874000	I'd be so offended if I was an elf.
3874000	3875000	A Keebler elf.
3875000	3877000	If you're a Keebler elf we're very sorry.
3877000	3881000	I can't believe those fucking cable cars are like tied to ropes.
3881000	3883000	Are you people insane.
3883000	3885000	What a kind of Rube Goldberg.
3885000	3887000	Is the whole thing powered.
3887000	3891000	In the morning does a chicken get startled by a balloon popping.
3891000	3894000	And make all of your mass transit go.
3894000	3898000	You're taking the green thing too seriously.
3899000	3900000	Can we.
3900000	3903000	I don't know how close she is to being able to be down here.
3903000	3904000	Are you in the back Aaron.
3904000	3905000	She's in the back.
3905000	3906000	Okay.
3906000	3907000	Can you come down here.
3907000	3912000	My betrothed.
3912000	3914000	Future Mrs. Harmon.
3914000	3916000	My other half Aaron McGathey.
3924000	3927000	I'll stand over here at the Q&A mic and I'll give this mic to Aaron.
3927000	3928000	Aaron here.
3928000	3929000	Take this.
3929000	3930000	Whoa.
3930000	3931000	We got double.
3932000	3933000	Thank you.
3934000	3935000	So yeah.
3935000	3936000	Aaron you're my mom now.
3937000	3938000	Tough breaks.
3939000	3941000	No you're my mom.
3941000	3942000	You're my mom.
3942000	3943000	You're my mom.
3943000	3944000	You're my mom.
3945000	3946000	It's like Beetlejuice.
3946000	3947000	Yeah.
3948000	3949000	Shame.
3949000	3950000	I'm worried you're working a little too much.
3950000	3951000	Yeah probably.
3951000	3952000	Yeah.
3952000	3953000	I want to move to Australia.
3953000	3954000	That's why I'm doing it.
3954000	3955000	Shame.
3955000	3956000	You can't leave us.
3956000	3957000	I didn't know you were going to be my mom yet.
3957000	3959000	But do you know someone in Australia?
3959000	3960000	I do not know anyone in Australia.
3960000	3961000	Exactly.
3961000	3962000	I know Australians aren't in Australia.
3962000	3964000	You just want to go to Australia.
3964000	3967000	Yeah I want to live there and not be in America.
3968000	3969000	Smart guy right.
3969000	3972000	It's just full of like murderous creatures and plants.
3972000	3973000	So is America.
3973000	3975000	I mean not creatures and plants.
3975000	3976000	No.
3976000	3978000	There are herds of Spencer's ex-girlfriend in Australia.
3978000	3982000	There's grass in Australia that will give you chlamydia.
3982000	3983000	Oh wow that's cool.
3983000	3984000	Come on.
3984000	3985000	Having a nice picnic?
3985000	3986000	Bam.
3986000	3987000	The clap.
3987000	3988000	Yeah.
3988000	3989000	Wait is chlamydia the clap?
3989000	3990000	I don't know.
3990000	3991000	Holy shit.
3991000	3993000	Is that what your girlfriend told you?
3993000	3994000	Yeah.
3995000	3997000	It's the grass Spencer.
3997000	3999000	It's the grass of picnic.
3999000	4001000	Spencer remember that picnic?
4001000	4002000	That picnic we had?
4002000	4003000	Yeah.
4003000	4006000	Spencer remember that picnic in Australia.
4006000	4007000	That's how it happened.
4009000	4011000	They got sand crabs.
4011000	4012000	They're big.
4013000	4015000	Just sand crabs.
4015000	4020000	Aaron is my long suffering fiance as described in various movie reviews.
4020000	4021000	That's a virtue.
4021000	4023000	It's a good thing to describe someone else.
4023000	4024000	It means patient.
4024000	4026000	That's how I'd describe her.
4026000	4027000	Long suffering.
4027000	4028000	Right.
4028000	4029000	Yeah.
4029000	4030000	No it's very flattering.
4030000	4031000	It's just funny reading.
4031000	4032000	It's a biblical word.
4032000	4034000	Oh all right.
4034000	4035000	Long suffering.
4035000	4040000	So if I was to go to a Starbucks and order a coffee and they're like how are you?
4040000	4041000	Long suffering.
4042000	4045000	Is that how you is that what biblical words are.
4045000	4046000	Yeah.
4046000	4049000	I am a Bible.
4049000	4051000	I am a Bible.
4051000	4058000	So Aaron do you have any suggestions on how to I brought shame up and he he's he said he was happy.
4059000	4062000	He had enough for right now at this very moment.
4062000	4063000	I'm happy.
4063000	4068000	He has three jobs and he's really only happy because we're here with him and he's up here.
4068000	4069000	Then I brought Austin up.
4069000	4073000	He's unhappy because his woman done done run off.
4073000	4080000	Well you you mentioned creating a human battery earlier and in order to create a battery you need energy going back and forth.
4080000	4089000	I would be curious to see like a 30 second rapid fire word association between shame and Austin.
4089000	4090000	Nice.
4090000	4091000	Locked eyes.
4091000	4092000	Oh shit.
4092000	4093000	At each other.
4093000	4094000	No judgment.
4095000	4097000	No no holding back.
4097000	4098000	Nice.
4098000	4099000	All right.
4099000	4100000	You want to do this Austin.
4100000	4101000	I'm down.
4101000	4102000	I'm totally down.
4102000	4105000	Are you guys going to say the words or do we say the word.
4105000	4106000	Oh no.
4106000	4107000	You say the word.
4107000	4108000	All right.
4108000	4109000	You say the word.
4109000	4110000	Austin.
4110000	4111000	Come on.
4111000	4112000	Back and forth.
4112000	4116000	I think it's important to say if we're really committing to this exercise that nobody nobody
4116000	4120000	in this room is allowed to judge anybody for saying any don't judge us up here because
4120000	4123000	they have to know that they're safe in order to actually do this properly.
4123000	4124000	Otherwise it's just a stick.
4124000	4126000	You know that they're not here often.
4126000	4127000	It's just us.
4127000	4128000	I'm just us.
4128000	4129000	Yeah.
4129000	4130000	Just us.
4130000	4131000	I don't know.
4131000	4132000	And Steve Agy because he's right behind you.
4132000	4133000	So to that.
4133000	4137640	So we'll judge for that to to keep that from happening or to make that happen.
4137640	4141560	Let's all be totally silent during the word association and then we'll talk about it.
4141560	4145280	So you guys pretend that you are alone in a cave.
4145280	4146280	How do we know when it ends.
4146280	4147280	Who's stopping it.
4147280	4149280	Does someone have a timer.
4149280	4150280	Yep.
4150280	4151280	All right.
4151280	4152280	Spencer will stop it.
4152280	4153280	I got it.
4153280	4154280	Okay.
4154280	4155280	And Dan's going to throw out the first word.
4156000	4158000	And we'll start with shame.
4158000	4159000	Nice.
4159000	4160000	Tomato.
4160000	4161000	Tomato.
4161000	4162000	Ketchup.
4162000	4163000	Vodka.
4163000	4164000	Mantis.
4164000	4165000	Pure.
4165000	4166000	Oh shit.
4166000	4167000	White.
4167000	4168000	Black.
4168000	4169000	Gray.
4169000	4170000	Interracial.
4170000	4171000	Fine.
4171000	4172000	Harmon town.
4172000	4173000	Podcast.
4173000	4174000	Aaron McGathey.
4174000	4175000	Aaron Carter.
4175000	4176000	How I beat Shaq.
4176000	4177000	Fuck.
4177000	4178000	Kobe Bryant.
4178000	4179000	And time.
4179000	4180000	Okay.
4180000	4181000	All right.
4181000	4182000	All right.
4182000	4183000	So how do we do.
4183000	4184000	I think we have a.
4184000	4185000	You did well.
4185000	4186000	Shame.
4186000	4187000	I feel like you were you were you were.
4187000	4190000	It was a pitch and catch situation instead of a mutual throwing and catch situation.
4190000	4191000	You know I think we have a.
4191000	4192000	I think I have a.
4192000	4193000	Well shame.
4193000	4203520	I feel like you were you were you were it was a pitch and catch situation instead of a mutual
4203520	4205160	throwing and catching.
4205160	4208680	So let's do it one more time and his word inspires your night.
4208680	4209680	Let's do that.
4209680	4210960	Well who won the first round.
4210960	4211960	There's no.
4211960	4212960	There's no winner.
4212960	4213960	Right.
4213960	4214960	Who won.
4214960	4215960	The audience is the winner.
4215960	4216960	Yeah.
4216960	4217960	Yeah.
4217960	4218960	The list.
4218960	4219960	I think Aaron Carter won the first round.
4219960	4220960	Aaron Carter did.
4220960	4221960	He hasn't been relevant in years.
4221960	4222960	Yeah.
4222960	4223960	He needs this.
4223960	4224960	He's welcome.
4224960	4225960	I love Aaron Carter.
4225960	4226960	I do too.
4226960	4227960	He had an awesome album.
4227960	4228960	He won.
4228960	4229960	Shaq.
4229960	4230960	He did beat Shaq.
4230960	4231960	That's why I said it.
4232400	4233400	That's how a beat Shaq.
4233400	4234400	No.
4234400	4235400	Stop talking about sports.
4235400	4236400	I'm talking about sports.
4236400	4237400	Yeah.
4237400	4238400	Sports corner is over.
4238400	4241080	My only rule.
4241080	4242080	Let's do.
4242080	4243080	So we'll do 15 seconds.
4243080	4244080	Okay.
4244080	4245080	Don't don't hold back.
4245080	4246080	Don't judge yourself.
4246080	4249400	Just say the first word that comes to mind from the other person.
4249400	4250400	Nice.
4250400	4251400	All right.
4251400	4254520	And we'll this time we will start with Austin killer and Dan.

4292880	4293880	So.
4293880	4294880	That's right.
4294880	4295880	Yeah.
4295880	4318080	It's like a
4348080	4351080	You have a story that only sells pickles.
4351080	4352080	Oh, okay.
4352080	4353080	Nice.
4353080	4354080	It's perfect.
4354080	4355080	I fucking love pickles.
4355080	4356080	Oh, we winning then.
4356080	4357080	Yeah.
4357080	4372240	But Austin, you are a shopkeeper in a store that only sells asparagus, and you're coming
4372240	4378840	in pretending to be a customer because you want to buy his shop.
4378840	4379840	Like the property.
4379840	4382300	Like the property of his shop, yeah.
4382300	4384600	To expand or just to move him?
4384600	4385600	You want a better location.
4385600	4386600	We'll find out.
4386600	4390220	You want a better location because you blame, you don't believe that people like pickles
4390220	4391220	more than asparagus.
4391220	4392220	They don't.
4392220	4393840	Your business is failing.
4393840	4394840	You want his place.
4394840	4398680	So you're exploring him for weaknesses, but you're pretending to just shop for pickles.
4398680	4403120	And Austin, this morning you received a mysterious telegram in the mail.
4403120	4405120	When is this taking place?
4405120	4406120	1942.
4406120	4407120	1942.
4407120	4408120	August.
4408120	4409120	Okay.
4409120	4410120	August 15th.
4410120	4418800	If it was 1942, I wouldn't have a shop and you that is that is part of it.
4418800	4419800	That is part of it.
4419800	4420800	Yeah.
4420800	4421800	Let that inform your choices.
4421800	4426920	But Austin, you received a telegram this morning from a family member and that telegram
4426920	4434360	read, uh, help me, uh, Nazi war machine encroaching stop.
4434360	4441720	And a shame has pyrokinesis that I can set things up with your brain.
4441720	4442720	Oh, nice.
4442720	4443720	Okay.
4443720	4444720	All right.
4444720	4445720	And I'll do, I'll do sound effects.
4445720	4446720	Nice.
4446720	4450560	Now these things can just inform all of your choices or you can make it about it.
4450560	4452600	But this is the, this is your life.
4452600	4457200	You're allergic to penicillin, both of you.
4457200	4458200	That's really shitty.
4458200	4459200	Yeah.
4459200	4462960	But you live in a world where allergy to penicillin is a, is a crime.
4462960	4464120	Oh wow.
4464120	4465520	You can be arrested for it.
4465520	4467760	So we're just itching all the time about stuff.
4467760	4468760	I don't know.
4468760	4469760	And shame.
4469760	4471880	You don't know it yet, but you're David Allen Greer's great uncle.
4471880	4475320	Let it just inform.
4475320	4478520	That's the most awesome thing I've ever heard.
4478520	4480480	I'm David Allen Greer's great uncle.
4480480	4481480	Yeah.
4481480	4482480	You don't know.
4482560	4485440	He made a blank man, but you don't know that you don't know it.
4485440	4486440	I don't know.
4486440	4487440	He made Blaine.
4487440	4488440	That's awesome movie.
4488440	4489440	You barely know television.
4489440	4490440	It doesn't even.
4490440	4491440	Yeah.
4491440	4492440	1942.
4492440	4493440	No blank man.
4493440	4494840	I mean, you made it kind of like by proxy.
4494840	4495840	Yeah.
4495840	4496840	Here we go.
4496840	4498520	Our San Francisco.
4498520	4500880	We present to you the magic of theater.
4500880	4503400	Oh no.
4503400	4510680	I'm setting all these pickles on fire with my mind and it's awesome.
4510680	4517480	What am I going to do today besides set stuff on fire with my mind?
4517480	4518480	Who said that?
4518480	4519480	Bullshit.
4519480	4522480	Who said that?
4522480	4523480	Are you in my shop now?
4523480	4524480	Oh, okay.
4524480	4525480	Yeah.
4525480	4526480	Oh, hey, hey, hey.
4526480	4527480	Take a number.
4527480	4528480	That's a nice belt.
4528480	4529480	I just.
4529480	4530480	Take a number.
4530480	4536800	I'm looking at 60.
4536800	4537800	What number are you on?
4537800	4541320	I'm on number two.
4541320	4542320	You have to wait.
4542320	4545640	There's nobody here, but you still have to wait.
4545640	4547100	I just wanted some pickles.
4547100	4548400	We don't have any pickles for you.
4548400	4549400	What do you sell?
4549400	4550400	Pickles.
4550400	4552520	How much do you, how much do you rent this place for?
4552520	4553600	How much do I rent this place?
4553600	4554720	I own this spot.
4554720	4557200	This is my place in 1942.
4557200	4558200	That's surprising.
4558200	4560280	It is depressing.
4560280	4561560	It's not depressing.
4561560	4562560	It's surprising.
4562560	4567760	Oh, it's, oh, it's both a little for me, I guess.
4568760	4570560	What kind of pickles do you want?
4570560	4575480	The pickle, the pickled kind, the kind that you would soak in a brine.
4575480	4576480	I don't do that.
4576480	4580320	I only set pickles on fire with my mind used to be cucumbers.
4580320	4582360	So like cooked ones is what you have.
4582360	4589200	So when I set the cucumbers on fire one hour later, so what kind of pickles do you want?
4589200	4590960	You're allergic to penicillin also.
4590960	4591960	Yeah.
4591960	4593640	I have this rash that won't go away.
4593640	4596360	I'm scratching myself, scratch, scratch.
4596360	4600000	This small business owner is allergic to penicillin and I just, I heard it from his
4600000	4601000	mouth.
4601000	4606560	Oh, well then we ought to take you off to the, uh, jail.
4606560	4610040	I don't want to like, I don't want to mess anything up, but I just, no, it's your duty
4610040	4611520	to report such things.
4611520	4613120	See that, that's what I, that's what I thought.
4613120	4614120	Um, yeah.
4614120	4618360	Oh, do we have a couple of troublemakers, officer O'Malley?
4618360	4620320	Oh, hey Stacey, how are you?
4620320	4626120	I'm just doing my beat and then I heard some fracas turns out we got a penicillin allergy
4626880	4627880	over here.
4627880	4632960	Officer O'Malley, it sounds like your wife's got your balls in a vise.
4632960	4633960	Your voice is very falsetto.
4633960	4637640	I'm doing what most of the people do back at the pre-sanct, which is make fun of my
4637640	4639240	higher register voice.
4639240	4644800	Uh, like to think that I overcompensate for it with good police work, but it's good to
4644800	4647280	see you jumping out a pretty easy bandwagon.
4647280	4654080	Yeah, remember what they told us in Ireland, uh, if it's easy to say what you're saying,
4654080	4655080	it ain't brave.
4655080	4656080	All right.
4656080	4657080	That's a creative.
4657080	4658080	I'm a cop.
4658080	4666200	I'm going to go ahead and move along and you deal with these two young men that was weird.
4666200	4667200	Back to the pickles.
4667200	4668200	Yeah.
4668200	4669200	Do you want?
4669200	4670760	You seem awfully obtuse about this.
4670760	4675000	Um, if I could just get some regular mustard pickles, that would be, I heard about you.
4675000	4676000	You want my shop.
4676000	4677000	Don't you?
4677000	4678000	I don't.
4678000	4679000	Yes, you do.
4679000	4680000	Don't lie to me.
4680000	4681480	Don't lie to me.
4681480	4683080	I got the pickles.
4683080	4689360	I just think that asparagus, much like, um, the white blonde blue eyed race, um, which
4689360	4696280	I hope to one day be a part of is, um, is just so superior.
4696280	4697480	I am white with blue eyes.
4697480	4698560	What are you trying to say?
4698560	4699560	I'm colorblind.
4699560	4700560	I don't see race.
4700560	4702640	Um, it's really, well, I'm white with blue eyes.
4702640	4708880	I believe you, but, um, I'm very trusting, um, which some people think is a character
4708880	4709880	flaw.
4709880	4710880	I don't know.
4710880	4711880	I feel like you shouldn't take advantage of me.
4711880	4719920	I want to bring asparagus to the people in the most healthy and, um, excrementally stinky
4719920	4724520	way, um, because I think it's important.
4724520	4725840	What do you think smells better?
4725840	4726840	Pickles or asparagus?
4726840	4729840	Uh, in or out?
4729840	4730840	In.
4730840	4733600	Oh, well, uh, well, pickles for sure.
4733600	4736520	And pickles coming out, probably.
4736520	4738720	What a day.
4738720	4739720	What a day.
4739720	4746440	Unfortunately, God was watching and God took note of the rest of what happened that day.
4746440	4752600	And now we'll hear from him and he will tell us what happened.
4752600	4753600	God.
4753600	4754600	It's funny.
4754600	4762120	You should mention that because almost immediately, uh, you know, the white blue haired blue eyed
4762120	4769400	guy is Tyrokinesis went crazy and exploded the world.
4769400	4770400	It's really a shame.
4770400	4771400	What a story.
4771400	4772400	He's down to about right.
4772400	4773400	All right.
4773400	4778400	Let's have, let's have a hand for shame and Austin.
4778400	4779400	All right.
4779400	4782640	I think, I think we've used, we've, we've rung them dry, right?
4782640	4786400	They should, they should take a seat and reap the benefits of their, let's give them a hand.
4786400	4787400	Everybody.
4787400	4788400	Shame and Austin.
4788400	4789400	Everybody.
4789400	4790400	Austin and Shane.
4790400	4808800	We really, we really, uh, sir, do you have a question?
4808800	4809800	We really break.
4809800	4810800	Yes.
4810800	4814400	Uh, when you were doing the movie, is there anything that you wanted to cut out?
4814400	4818760	Um, the, uh, yeah, we really, we really wrote those guys hard.
4819760	4820760	They, they, they, they, they earned it.
4820760	4823760	It's giving Dan Harmon a hug guys.
4824760	4828760	I sound like this guy doesn't work hard enough at the bakery and the panini shop.
4828760	4829760	Look at that.
4829760	4831760	He's getting high fives all the way up the aisle.
4831760	4835760	His grandma fucking riding him in that vegetable garden.
4836760	4841760	Pick more basil.
4841760	4842760	Shame.
4842760	4843760	Nailed it.
4846760	4847760	Uncanny.
4847760	4848760	That's what gardening is.
4848760	4852760	Dan, in a day of a gardener, what, what would you do?
4852760	4854760	It's like, uh, you know, shame's going.
4854760	4855760	He has four hours.
4855760	4856760	His grandmother's like, I'm so happy.
4856760	4857760	Okay.
4857760	4861760	And you, I'm gonna, uh, is the dirt tilled Shane?
4861760	4862760	You're the person in charge of the guy.
4862760	4865760	I'm going to tell the dirt and I'm going to poke holes in it, drop seeds in the holes,
4865760	4869760	cover over the holes with dirt, wait for the seeds to grow into germinated things,
4869760	4870760	put water on them.
4871760	4872760	What if the plants are already grown?
4872760	4873760	What is it?
4873760	4875760	What if it's a vegetable garden and you're just coming in for maintenance?
4876760	4878760	That's all he does is water the grass.
4879760	4881760	Is it clap grass or regular grass?
4882760	4883760	It's Australian.
4883760	4885760	It's a chlamydia grass, Australian chlamydia grass.
4885760	4888760	If that's real, I would immediately get chlamydia, chlamydia,
4888760	4890760	because clap grass just sounds fun.
4893760	4898760	You know, come to this park, there's a bunch of clap grass.
4898760	4899760	All right.
4899760	4900760	I'd like recognition.
4901760	4904760	Hey Spencer, are you, uh, uh, I'm, all right.
4904760	4905760	What?

4915760	4917760	So we got a, we got a dignity SARS guard.
4917760	4922760	We got me, uh, Agile play, uh, Quark, I assume.
4922760	4927760	And, uh, we would need a, um, uh, uh, Christa Berg.
4927760	4932760	Uh, we have to, we have to, it'll have to be based on more than just plain desire.
4932760	4936760	I, I, um, I, I want to figure out how to, what to base it on.
4937760	4938760	How about this guy whose question?
4938760	4940760	Oh, that guy's in a weekly Pathfinder game.
4940760	4941760	What's it?
4941760	4942760	Oh, that guy, wait.
4942760	4944760	Oh, you're, oh, you're like an expert role player.
4944760	4946760	Oh, he didn't say that.
4946760	4948760	Nobody wants to say that and then come up and play.
4949760	4951760	Doesn't that just make you a sociopath?
4953760	4954760	I can be anyone.
4954760	4956760	But you can help us get back on track.
4956760	4957760	All right.

4979760	4980760	All right.
4981760	4983760	Is there anything we didn't cover?
4983760	4986760	We covered Ebola, uh, mass transit.
4987760	4990760	That cable car thing is amazing.
4990760	4993760	I was here for my bachelorette party a couple of weeks ago.
4995760	4997760	I fucked the bridge.
5002760	5003760	Uh, yeah.
5004760	5005760	Right.

5007760	5011760	And Dick piercing and mass transit and feminism and, uh,
5012760	5014760	I hesitate to ask, but do you want to hit gamer gate?
5014760	5016760	I do not want to hit gamer gate.
5016760	5017760	Okay.
5017760	5019760	Uh, if I'm obligated to ask,
5019760	5022760	I've been trying to read up on that and I continue to read up on it.
5022760	5026760	And it's like, I find it, I find it very fascinating and I don't dismiss it at all.
5026760	5027760	And I don't do not dismiss it.
5027760	5029760	And I don't know, did not dismiss, dismiss it.
5029760	5031760	And I don't dismiss, not dismissing it.
5032760	5038760	I think it's amazing that we, that this new generation is able to create like,
5038760	5040760	like, like kind of whirlpools.
5040760	5043760	And I'm not even dismissing it by saying that like, like, where you just like,
5043760	5049760	you're 41 and you go, that is a, like, you can't get through that.
5050760	5053760	Uh, like, like, like, you can't just be a casual person,
5053760	5057760	like coming through an issue and get from one side of it to the other and
5057760	5060760	grab a drink from the bar and come back through it.
5060760	5063760	Like you will be on one side or the other,
5063760	5065760	whatever those sides are in this issue.
5065760	5068760	Like, like we have gotten really good at outrage.
5068760	5071760	We've gotten really good at, at like, at shaming each other.
5071760	5078760	And like, uh, you can't, you can't say much of anything, uh, without, without,
5078760	5082760	there's always going to be the possibility of just like, uh,
5082760	5086760	a huge group of people, like, like, like really on your shit.
5086760	5088760	They already lost someone.
5088760	5091760	No, she's, she's, yeah.
5091760	5094760	She hates gamer gay. She works in shame's garden.
5094760	5099760	She takes over shame's shift in the morning.
5099760	5102760	Don't let her let, don't let the last sounds of her leaving, uh,
5102760	5105760	be that we've branded her a gamer gator.
5105760	5109760	I don't know.
5109760	5112760	She hates it. She hates it.
5112760	5114760	Uh, yeah, I, I had to, as a 41 year old,
5114760	5118760	I had to get out my little bifocals and read gamer gator articles just at,
5118760	5121760	at, at three times and try to figure out like, what, what's the gate?
5121760	5123760	And where's the thing? And the, yeah,
5123760	5125760	but you can't even say that because then someone will go like,
5125760	5128760	you said there's no gate. Fuck you.
5128760	5133760	Uh, I don't care. Uh, I, I, I, I, I would like, you said you don't care.
5133760	5137760	Yeah. Like you, you couldn't even say something like, like, for instance,
5137760	5141760	like, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not going to say I'm not sorry.
5141760	5144760	Here we go. I was actually about to actually just say something.
5144760	5147760	And I actually, I really, I know you can't actually say it. Okay.
5147760	5150760	I'm going to wait for it to blow over. How's that? That's not a sin, right?
5150760	5153760	Can you wait for it to blow over? Is that, does that make you a bad person?
5153760	5155760	That's fine. That's fine. Let's see it.
5155760	5157760	Let's see if gamer gate's worth its salt.
5157760	5161760	Let's see if it can last another three months and then I'll weigh in.
5161760	5163760	Yeah, it can. All right.
5163760	5166760	It's just 15 year olds.
5166760	5168760	What's happening you guys?
5168760	5172760	Everyone's just, it's just 15 year olds.
5172760	5176760	It's fortune, baby. It's all kids.
5176760	5178760	You just got your credit cards hacked.
5178760	5180760	I've been dying to see.
5180760	5183760	I've been dying to see these character sheets and to see what's on there.
5183760	5186760	Oh yeah. Just lies.
5186760	5188760	It's all peanut butter and spit.
5188760	5190760	That's just yours, Aaron.
5190760	5192760	Thank you.
5192760	5196760	Not a joke.
5196760	5201760	Yeah, there, there are a few unfortunate, very drunk shows that we've had where.
5201760	5203760	Just like that.
5203760	5204760	Collected some stuff.
5204760	5208760	A gamer gator hacked your microphone.
5208760	5214760	So there's a rope in the street and it pulls the car,
5214760	5219760	it pulls the car up a hill like a wagon and then it's a cable.
5219760	5223760	Okay. It's not a rope. That's dismissive. I'm sorry.
5223760	5228760	There's hooks on the, right.
5228760	5233760	And the cable is, so it's sort of like a ski lift in principle, right?
5233760	5237760	And so you're kind of like, but, but does it, does it, do you,
5237760	5240760	do you reverse it at the, at a certain time?
5240760	5242760	Because I assume, I assume that.
5242760	5245760	Yeah. At the bottom of the hill.
5245760	5248760	Like an escalator.
5248760	5251760	No, I've never been in one. How late do they run?
5251760	5253760	Oh guys, come on. Let's all get on.
5253760	5254760	Forever.
5254760	5256760	It's like an Andy Kaufman show.
5256760	5260760	What's up for cookies and milk and a, not a trolley.
5260760	5264760	Um, I just, I mean, it's not like an oscillating thing where it goes up and
5264760	5267760	then it goes back down.
5267760	5272760	Oh, it goes around like a, okay. Okay. Cool. Got it. Got it.
5272760	5275760	Wow. I have so much to learn about cable cars.
5275760	5277760	There's a museum.
5277760	5279760	And guess what? It's boring.
5279760	5283760	No, no cable gate.
5283760	5285760	It's not boring.
5285760	5289760	It's only boring to women.
5289760	5295760	My, my period gets in the way of having fun at the cable car museum.
5295760	5299760	Oh boy. All these hormones. What? Cables?
5299760	5303760	Get me chocolate. Bring me to a chocolate museum.
5303760	5306760	On a Monday.
5306760	5309760	Maybe, maybe, maybe that museum's for me.
5309760	5313760	Maybe, maybe I'm like the one guy that museum's been waiting for.
5313760	5317760	I have a lot of questions about cable cars.
5318760	5320760	I kind of love it.
5320760	5323760	I want a cable car.
5323760	5327760	No one say anything. Just let him monologue forever.
5327760	5330760	All right. I'll get a Tesla.
5330760	5333760	All right. Some D and D. You need a, you need a theme song.
5333760	5335760	I don't know. It sounds like Dustin has music.
5335760	5338760	Oh yeah. Dustin's Dustin have music.
5338760	5343760	I'm going to give Dustin 60 seconds. So let's just be nails.
5344760	5347760	Let's do some word associations.
5347760	5348760	All right.
5348760	5349760	Able car.
5349760	5350760	A pulley trolley.
5350760	5351760	Hot dog.
5351760	5352760	Bun.
5352760	5353760	Man.
5353760	5354760	Cancer.
5354760	5355760	Butt.
5355760	5356760	Hole.
5356760	5358760	Why am I doing two words?
5358760	5359760	Cave.
5359760	5361760	What did you say?
5361760	5363760	Mustard.
5363760	5364760	Mustard seed.
5364760	5365760	How's Dustin doing?
5365760	5366760	I have no reception. Hold on.
5366760	5368760	All right. Well, reception.
5368760	5370760	We could go a cappella. I mean.
5370760	5371760	Dan, can you a cappella?
5371760	5372760	Sure, sure.
5372760	5375760	Um, but I don't mind.
5375760	5381760	When we last met, our heroes had finally escaped from Rose book after
5381760	5383760	defeating Admiral Dark. No, not him.
5383760	5387760	After defeating Father Tinder and dodging the city guards, the gang
5387760	5391760	piled into dignity's horse and they charged the police blockade,
5391760	5394760	breaking out of the town, freed, but without direction.
5394760	5399760	Our heroes came across a small hill in a swamp, a hill with a window,
5399760	5400760	peering into the window.
5400760	5403760	Quark spied a showering lady and framed her.
5403760	5407760	But after a terrible excuse, the gang entered her home.
5407760	5410760	They shared some awkward conversation before leaving.
5410760	5414760	But when they left, they encountered a crippled fire elemental.
5414760	5418760	And although they started in anger and rage, they came to an understanding
5418760	5420760	and left the fire elemental alone.
5420760	5425760	But not before Quark burned his dick off in an ill-fated sexual assault.
5425760	5427760	But where would the gang go?
5427760	5429760	What would they do?
5429760	5431760	How would they get to the Air City?
5431760	5433760	Did they even care about getting there?
5433760	5438760	Find out next on an all-new Harman Town.
5438760	5442760	Here it is, salary, holiday, pop, pop, pop.
5442760	5446760	Here we are, here we are, here we are, pop, pop, pop.
5447760	5451760	All right, so you guys, you guys are, you're on the main road
5451760	5452760	heading out of Rose book.
5452760	5455760	This path, this main road is winding its way,
5455760	5459760	meandering through the rolling grassy hills of the landscape,
5459760	5461760	gently to the northeast.
5461760	5466760	This is the path the Sharpie decided to go down after you guys said
5466760	5468760	that you couldn't go farther into the swamp,
5468760	5470760	and then you left the lady and you didn't want to go back to town.
5470760	5472760	So you're just like, I'm going down this road.
5472760	5473760	Yeah.
5473760	5474760	That's where you are.
5474760	5478760	I've been pushing the, I've been testing the limits of like,
5478760	5480760	can you actually just make Spencer?
5480760	5482760	And what'd you learn?
5482760	5483760	You can't.
5484760	5487760	Well, I know I can, but I'll regret it, right?
5487760	5488760	I don't know.
5488760	5489760	I'll regret it.
5489760	5492760	If I, if I, if I couldn't, you'd be, you know,
5492760	5495760	it would be because you were a tyrant.
5495760	5496760	You're not a tyrant.
5496760	5497760	Thank you.
5497760	5499760	You're a benevolent, impersonal cosmic force.
5499760	5500760	That's why I do this.
5500760	5504760	You allow me to walk west in one direction forever.
5504760	5507760	I will encounter cacti and swamps.
5507760	5508760	That's what's there.
5508760	5510760	That's what's to the west.
5510760	5512760	But if I really want to enjoy myself,
5512760	5514760	I got to go back to your narrative.
5514760	5516760	Well, that's not even necessarily true.
5516760	5519760	You just have to create your own narrative.
5519760	5520760	I will.
5520760	5521760	All right.
5521760	5522760	So, so are we still close to the town?
5522760	5523760	Can we see the town from where we are?
5523760	5524760	Yeah.
5524760	5525760	It's pretty far off in the distance,
5525760	5527760	but you can still see it.
5527760	5531760	You know, it's one of the only landmarks in this kind of hill area.
5531760	5532760	Yeah.
5532760	5533760	I'm curious.
5533760	5536760	Can we tell whether dark star has gotten through the shield protecting
5536760	5538760	the town and whether the town is being totally destroyed?
5538760	5541760	Um, dark star was actually chasing you guys down,
5541760	5545760	but then he saw something happening over at the town and then he left.
5545760	5548760	That was the skeletons climbing the forest field
5548760	5550760	and then they disappeared in a flash.
5550760	5551760	Yeah.
5551760	5552760	That upset dark star.
5552760	5555760	You think it might've had something to do with that necromancer frost giant,
5555760	5558760	but he's miles away.
5558760	5561760	Boy, that dot, I'm not connecting the necromancer frost giant.
5561760	5562760	Yeah, I know the plot.
5562760	5565760	It just happens whether or not anyone pays attention, you know?
5565760	5566760	Wait, but what?
5567760	5568760	Are we still in the company?
5568760	5570760	What I'm saying to you is I don't, I don't recall.
5570760	5574760	Obviously it's not a big surprise that I'm always drunk when we're playing.
5574760	5579760	I don't recall any actual overt connections between the necromancer frost giant
5579760	5580760	and that stuff.
5580760	5581760	Yeah.
5581760	5583760	That would be me and narrator explaining things that you,
5583760	5585760	the characters would have no knowledge of.
5585760	5586760	So no, I didn't say anything.
5586760	5589760	Oh, you didn't, but you just did now.
5589760	5590760	Right.
5590760	5591760	Okay.
5591760	5593760	So I thought dark star was going in, was still going into the city.
5593760	5594760	Nah, he was chasing.
5594760	5595760	You guys saw the thing took off.
5595760	5596760	Okay.
5596760	5600760	Gentlemen, I think that we should head to the air city.
5600760	5602760	It seems like the right idea.
5602760	5607760	Coco is pointed in this direction and like I always say, horses know best.
5607760	5609760	We know the rest.
5609760	5611760	You do always say that.
5611760	5616760	Those skeletons back at the city, they remind me of that frost giant.
5618760	5621760	Thank you for sharing your feelings of association.
5621760	5623760	Let's go to the air city.
5623760	5624760	They remind you of the frost giant.
5624760	5625760	The shards of power.
5625760	5631760	The frost giant wanted the admiral sars guard.
5631760	5638760	So you got killed by the frost giant necromancer and then we gave him the shard in order to
5638760	5639760	get the army.
5639760	5640760	We gave him the shards.
5640760	5642760	We keep giving shards away.
5642760	5644760	And Father Tender also had a shard.
5644760	5648760	He did, but it might've vanished in the scuffle.
5648760	5651760	Guys always looking for shards is looking to accrue shards.
5651760	5656760	Got a feeling that admiral darkstar getting all those shards ain't best for anybody.
5656760	5658760	I pull Sharpie aside.
5658760	5659760	Yes.
5659760	5663760	Sir, is something going on with you beneath the surface?
5663760	5668760	You seem to be questioning everything we're doing and I am not well versed in the way
5668760	5673760	of emotions or feelings, but it seems that this is pertinent.
5673760	5679760	Sometimes I feel like someone's controlling me that may or may not be an alcoholic.
5679760	5683760	And so I have blackouts where I am motivated by different things.
5683760	5690760	Sometimes I become conscious and I'm halfway down a road that I ran down out of defiance
5690760	5692760	of nothing.
5692760	5694760	Then I'm a little more sober.
5694760	5695760	I don't know.
5695760	5700760	I'm going to ask you the question I ask myself every morning in a puddle.
5700760	5704760	What do you want out of this day?
5704760	5709760	I don't want the world to be destroyed by admiral darkstar.
5709760	5714760	I say, hey, what are you guys talking about over there?
5714760	5715760	What are our obligations?
5715760	5720760	I mean, what are we doing if we're not saving the world, if admiral darkstar is going to
5720760	5727760	accrue power and become a more powerful admiral with darker stars?
5727760	5730760	So it seems like a great idea long term for us to take out darkstar.
5730760	5732760	We've been fighting him for two years now.
5732760	5738760	I have to ask the question, Dignity, this is your town and it's being swarmed over by
5738760	5739760	skeletons?
5739760	5742760	You know me better than I know me.
5742760	5747760	So should we not, while we're here, go kick the asses of the things that are trying to
5747760	5748760	destroy your town?
5748760	5750760	I think that is an excellent idea.
5750760	5751760	That's a great idea.
5751760	5752760	That is a great idea.
5752760	5754760	Sharpie, let's do it.
5754760	5755760	Okay.
5755760	5756760	Let's fight.
5756760	5757760	All right.
5757760	5760760	And I promise, no matter what happens from now on, I'm really going to understand what
5760760	5764760	we're doing and why we're doing it.
5764760	5770760	I lift Quark up from between his legs, which now is nothing, and put him on my shoulder
5770760	5771760	like a wishbone.
5771760	5775760	My dick really burns, where my dick used to be really burns.
5775760	5776760	Be careful.
5776760	5778760	I just want to carry you, little one.
5778760	5779760	All right.
5779760	5785760	So you ride back towards the town and you can't help but notice a conspicuous lack of skeletons
5785760	5787760	as if they'd all disappeared.
5788760	5795760	You get closer to the town and closer still, and you see small piles of ash.
5795760	5798760	Not skeleton size, but just small piles of ash.
5798760	5803760	That seems to be the only sign that any creatures or anything have been around the town.
5803760	5805760	Obviously, it's still protected by the barrier.
5805760	5808760	Is it like in the Batman movie where the people are dehydrated?
5808760	5809760	No.
5809760	5810760	No.
5810760	5811760	What?
5811760	5813760	Are these piles of ash outside the town?
5813760	5814760	Yeah.
5814760	5816760	You haven't entered the town physically as of yet.
5817760	5819760	You say they're not skeleton size, the piles of ash.
5819760	5820760	No.
5820760	5824760	What you're saying is we don't think that these piles of ash are the skeletons we're
5824760	5825760	disintegrating.
5825760	5828760	Do we hear screaming and mayhem and the sound of combat?
5828760	5829760	It's all a piece.
5829760	5834760	You don't see any skeletons, just this ash business and the dome protecting Rosebook
5834760	5836760	from all evil.
5836760	5837760	We did it, guys.
5837760	5838760	We did it.
5838760	5842760	Well, as we were leaving, I saw the skeletons disappear.
5842760	5845760	I think it was like a ... I don't know.
5846760	5850760	And that angel, the Yoshi Angel Darkstar figures gone, too?
5850760	5851760	Yeah.
5851760	5852760	He took off after he saw the skeletons disappear.
5852760	5854760	Are we able to enter the city?
5854760	5858760	Yeah, if you want, but you did escape from police.
5858760	5859760	Oh, yeah.
5859760	5861760	Let's get the fuck out of here.
5862760	5863760	There's no one to fight.
5863760	5864760	Let's go.
5864760	5865760	All right.
5865760	5866760	Okay.
5866760	5867760	Well, it's important to have these moments.
5868760	5874760	Quickly before we go, can I examine the piles of ash and see if there's anything to that?
5874760	5875760	Yeah.
5875760	5880760	You examine the piles of ash, and they seem not to be ash at all, but actually really
5880760	5887760	finely crushed up onyx dust that's a gemstone associated with necromancy, as well as teleportation
5887760	5888760	magic.
5888760	5889760	Interesting.
5889760	5892760	I wonder who could have sent legions of skeletons.
5892760	5894760	Well, the cross giant.
5894760	5897760	I mean, I already had a feeling that he was involved.
5899760	5900760	All right, gentlemen.
5900760	5906760	You think these dust piles are deposits that are the residual result of teleportation magic
5906760	5909760	on the part of a necromancy frost giant?
5909760	5910760	Or just dumped.
5910760	5911760	He's done using them.
5911760	5912760	They're no longer valuable.
5912760	5913760	Maybe he got.
5913760	5915760	He was able to get the shard.
5917760	5920760	I thought that Darkstar was commanding the skeletons.
5920760	5924760	It sounds like either Darkstar and this guy are working together, the necromancer.
5924760	5927760	They didn't seem to be aligned in the past.
5927760	5928760	Why are you looking at me?
5929760	5933760	The face that people are looking at me like I'm supposed to do something.
5933760	5936760	I don't think there's any way that the frost giant is in league with Darkstar.
5936760	5938760	I mean, these are too big.
5938760	5940760	You can't have a solar system with two suns.
5940760	5946760	Not that I know what a solar system is, but I mean, they're both giant assholes that'll
5946760	5947760	do nothing.
5947760	5950760	They'll stop at nothing to get fucking dumb ass shards.
5950760	5952760	I've run across both of them.
5952760	5954760	I think that I don't think they would work together.
5955760	5958760	I start gathering up the onyx dust and I put it in my backpack.
5958760	5959760	You do that.
5959760	5961760	You gather up several dusts.
5962760	5963760	All right.
5963760	5964760	We've got to figure out what to do.
5964760	5965760	Okay.
5965760	5967760	So the skeletons showed up.
5967760	5969760	The skeletons assailed the city.
5969760	5975760	It's like, and I remember Darkstar going like, and then getting mad and leaving.
5975760	5977760	It's like the skeletons showed up.
5977760	5978760	The skeletons represent the frost giant.
5978760	5979760	They showed up.
5979760	5980760	Then they disappeared.
5980760	5982760	Then Admiral Darkstar disappeared.
5982760	5988760	If we really wanted to get into the fray, I reckon that means it's back at the ice
5988760	5990760	frost giant's city.
5990760	5996760	I don't know why we'd want to go there, but except to save the world eventually.
5996760	5999760	But it would have to be in a really unlikely way because we're not an army of
5999760	6004760	skeletons or a giant or horrible powerful wizards.
6004760	6009760	We're just a ragtag group of occasional rapists and murderers.
6009760	6012760	You know what lies within us?
6012760	6014760	The souls of rapists and murderers.
6014760	6015760	Skeletons.
6015760	6019760	We are a small army of skeletons.
6019760	6020760	Yeah.
6020760	6023760	But we have more than bones.
6023760	6024760	We have heart.
6024760	6026760	We have lungs.
6026760	6027760	Just literally.
6027760	6028760	A sense of adventure.
6028760	6033760	We've also leveled up a lot since the last time we fought that guy.
6033760	6034760	They have.
6034760	6036760	But I always lose track of my spells.
6036760	6037760	Yeah, you're outside the city.
6037760	6047760	I charge a gallop with Coco into the city to just see what the climate is.
6047760	6051760	There's people, you know, just busy people living their lives.
6051760	6054760	There's occasional guards standing around.
6054760	6060760	They're noticing your horse and pointing at you and starting to yell and grab torches.
6060760	6065760	Can I look through my blood book and approach for teleportation stuff?
6066760	6071760	I use diplomacy and I approach the villager with the most interesting accent.
6074760	6075760	Teleport.
6075760	6077760	There's no teleporting in that blood book, I'm afraid.
6077760	6078760	OK.
6078760	6080760	Scoops were wanted by the law in that town.
6080760	6081760	Yeah.
6081760	6082760	You find this guy with the accent.
6082760	6086760	He's like, you ran me over with the horse when we were trying to find you
6086760	6087760	because I'm sorry.
6087760	6089760	So I was looking for somebody else.
6089760	6091760	You're going to have to stop.
6091760	6093760	Get off that horse there.
6093760	6094760	All right.
6094760	6102760	I use diplomacy and I say, so sorry, just wanted to apologize again and goodbye.
6102760	6104760	I'm going to go.
6104760	6108760	What's the opposite way that we're going east at the moment?
6108760	6110760	But I shouldn't lie.
6110760	6116760	I just I kissed the air a million times, confusedly, and I make a fart noise.
6116760	6121760	And I say Friday's at six and I just gallop out.
6122760	6125760	I feel like that's like performance or something.
6125760	6126760	You don't have any performance range.
6126760	6127760	Really?
6127760	6128760	You think that's a performance?
6128760	6129760	I have performance.
6129760	6130760	It's certainly not diplomacy at that point.
6130760	6131760	I'm Christopher.
6131760	6132760	I have performance.
6132760	6133760	I'll start playing the wiresaw.
6133760	6134760	A wire.
6134760	6137760	Yeah.
6137760	6141760	Playing the wiresaw makes her diplomacy seem a lot more so.
6141760	6142760	Thank you.
6142760	6144760	You managed to get out of there.
6144760	6145760	OK.
6145760	6153760	I consult my my gem of audience talking to because I'm wondering, am I missing something?
6153760	6157760	Is there someone in our party have the power to like mass teleport?
6157760	6159760	No, we could just we can just go there.
6159760	6162760	We could like rest up and head on our way.
6162760	6167760	I have three scissors.
6167760	6170760	We need to cut something.
6170760	6171760	Why do you have three?
6171760	6172760	I don't know.
6172760	6173760	That's what's on this.
6173760	6174760	That's so funny.
6174760	6178760	How did you end up with three scissors?
6178760	6179760	All right.
6179760	6180760	Well, I mean, yeah.
6180760	6183760	And six combs.
6183760	6186760	Oh, that was because Mark eluded.
6186760	6192760	He looted a barbershop.
6192760	6193760	It's all coming back.
6193760	6194760	I remember that.
6194760	6196760	Well, OK, Spencer.
6196760	6197760	Yeah.
6197760	6199760	I'm meta asking you this question.
6199760	6200760	Yeah.
6200760	6206760	Our trail that brought us here like back when we were at that frost giant city.
6206760	6207760	Yeah.
6207760	6214760	How many trans planer were, you know, jumps did we make or is it a physical?
6214760	6220760	Well, you took you took what you took a Tylenol with codeine out from there.
6220760	6222760	So it was like a unicorn jaunt.
6222760	6223760	Do we know?
6223760	6226760	My short question is, do we know how to get back to that frost giant city?
6226760	6227760	Not exactly.
6227760	6228760	You know, the general heading.
6228760	6231760	But I mean, it's a mountain range that's, you know, well known.
6231760	6232760	I mean, it's a long shot.
6232760	6234760	Well, let's head to the mountain range.
6234760	6236760	Well, then what do you what do you want to do?
6236760	6237760	Well, scoops.
6237760	6241760	I'm trying to what I'm trying to save the cock sucking world.
6241760	6243760	What what was the deal with the air city again?
6243760	6244760	What was there?
6244760	6247760	Oh, you know, just robot baby memories.
6247760	6248760	Right. OK.
6248760	6249760	I mean, there's that, too.
6249760	6253760	It's like we could we could, you know, it's like it's like there's tons of possibilities
6253760	6254760	that no one's choosing.
6254760	6256760	So why don't we go make a choice?
6256760	6258760	Let's let's make our way.
6258760	6259760	Let's make our way towards the mountain range.
6259760	6261760	Let's go towards the frost giants.
6261760	6262760	It'll take us some time.
6262760	6265760	We haven't slept in like literally 20 adventures.
6265760	6270760	Like let's camp for the night and let's start making it on the on the horse and on our way.
6270760	6277760	That's my pitch because the baby upgrade is just selfish, chaotic, evil kind of garbage.
6277760	6281760	Like we're like, hey, life's a video game and the.
6282760	6287760	But on the other hand, the going back to the Frost Giants city is like kind of almost futile,
6287760	6289760	like naive.
6289760	6291760	Maybe we could help be good.
6291760	6294760	You sound like a guy just stuck in his apartment for a year when he moves to L.A.
6294760	6296760	And he's like, I should wear a screenplay.
6296760	6300760	But movies are so bad now and I don't want to follow the man.
6300760	6301760	Let's just go.
6301760	6303760	First of all, what's a screenplay?
6303760	6308760	Second of all, you thought what's a Scoops?
6308760	6316760	I as dignity service guard, my my sense of righteousness over outweighs my sense of loyalty to this group,
6316760	6317760	which is still great.
6317760	6319760	And I start I pack.
6319760	6323760	I make motions to move towards the range where I know the Frost Diana's.
6323760	6324760	I'm with you.
6324760	6325760	Thank you.
6325760	6326760	Jump on, Christopher.
6326760	6327760	And on the way.
6327760	6328760	I want it on this.
6328760	6329760	I want it on this.
6329760	6330760	I also have four knives.
6332760	6333760	All right, Quirk.
6333760	6334760	Nice.
6334760	6335760	We're safe.
6335760	6336760	I got four knives.
6336760	6337760	I'm coming to my idea.
6337760	6338760	Of course.
6339760	6341760	You shamed me for it.
6341760	6344760	I have no sense of shaming.
6345760	6350760	The only meaning for shame I know is celebration.
6350760	6351760	Prayer.
6351760	6352760	Praying God.
6352760	6353760	Praising God.
6353760	6355760	So we ride and then we camp.
6356760	6357760	Yes.
6357760	6358760	This is the good part.
6358760	6360760	And at the campfire.
6361760	6364760	Guys, let's talk.
6368760	6370760	I think I'm going to turn in.
6370760	6371760	My dad.
6371760	6373760	Wait, please stay up.
6374760	6377760	My dad used to beat me so hard.
6377760	6381760	Guys, I know a great song we can sing by the campfire.
6381760	6383760	Do you?
6383760	6388760	I whittle a alligator.
6388760	6391760	I comb Sharpie's hair.
6392760	6395760	What's your whittling Sharpie?
6397760	6398760	It's an alligator.
6398760	6402760	It's the shape of an alligator, but it doubles as a clothespin.
6402760	6405760	The alligator's mouth is like a clothespin thing.
6405760	6406760	That's clever.
6406760	6407760	It's cool.
6407760	6408760	It's cool.
6408760	6410760	We can use this to hang clothes.
6412760	6414760	Or just pin them.
6415760	6420760	I repeat an Elvis chant to myself telling myself to be strong.
6421760	6424760	The subtitles say,
6424760	6428760	Grace from the rivers of the father.
6428760	6431760	Tombstones run deep through the dank.
6431760	6434760	Arrows of flint be flinty.
6434760	6438760	Ears are pointy as hearts are seep.
6438760	6441760	Dank, dark dungeons deep.
6441760	6446760	Sky, river,
6446760	6452760	horse, river,
6452760	6458760	tree, sunset.
6458760	6461760	All right, and then we wake up.
6461760	6464760	Thank God no spiders attacked us.
6464760	6467760	And your hair looks great.
6467760	6472760	I even cut some of those split ends with one of my three scissors.
6473760	6475760	Then we keep traveling.
6475760	6476760	Okay.
6476760	6479760	Oh, yeah.
6479760	6482760	I thought the campfire was going to be some sort of...
6482760	6483760	No way, man.
6483760	6484760	Yeah.
6484760	6489760	You keep traveling and you come across a small, colorful,
6489760	6492760	tent-topped stand.
6492760	6495760	You see a small boy, perhaps 13 years of age,
6495760	6497760	sitting inside a tent.
6497760	6499760	Holding a hand-painted sign that says,
6499760	6502760	wilderness guide, 20 gold pieces.
6502760	6503760	Yes.
6503760	6504760	Oh, yeah.
6504760	6506760	That's a little high.
6506760	6507760	Inflation.
6507760	6508760	Hey, man.
6508760	6512760	You could get like 600,000 feet of rope for that.
6512760	6513760	You could.
6513760	6518760	Or you could hire a great guide to the wilderness.
6518760	6520760	I'm Lil Baskins.
6520760	6523760	And I'm a wilderness guy.
6523760	6524760	Say there, boy.
6524760	6525760	Boy.
6525760	6528760	What know you of the ice giant city?
6528760	6531760	Oh, I know all about all the wilderness.
6531760	6534760	That's why I guide people through it.
6534760	6535760	You there, boy.
6535760	6537760	How much for a tour there?
6537760	6539760	Well, I have this sign.
6539760	6540760	The big one.
6540760	6543760	I'm holding this sign right so you could read it.
6543760	6547760	If Flint were salt, you'd have a supper load.
6547760	6549760	I'm holding it.
6550760	6553760	If Flint were salt, you'd have a supper load.
6553760	6558760	Man, I don't get your jive speech.
6558760	6560760	Here's what you will get.
6560760	6562760	Ten sovereigns, not a penny more.
6562760	6565760	Sovereigns aren't accepted in the realm here.
6565760	6566760	They're gold.
6566760	6569760	Well, I asked for 20.
6569760	6572760	It's on the sign clearly marked.
6572760	6574760	You look to deserve 40.
6574760	6576760	I look to deserve 40.
6576760	6577760	40.
6577760	6580760	How would you haggle?
6580760	6584760	I say, boy, will you trade for yarn?
6584760	6587760	I have yarn in my backpack.
6587760	6590760	I'll give you two copper for some yarn, man.
6590760	6593760	If you want yarn, I mean, if you have yarn, I want it.
6593760	6594760	She just gave him 40 gold.
6594760	6596760	Yeah, I got spending copper.
6596760	6597760	All right, okay.
6597760	6599760	We better get the platinum tour.
6599760	6603760	Oh, well, I mean, you're getting guided, not toured.
6603760	6604760	Yeah, yeah.
6604760	6605760	Jesus Christ.
6606760	6608760	Are you giving us a tour of semantics?
6608760	6609760	What is your name, young man?
6609760	6611760	I'm Lil Baskins.
6611760	6612760	Lil Baskins?
6612760	6614760	Lil Baskins.
6614760	6615760	Lil Baskins.
6615760	6618760	I was born in a Baskin.
6620760	6621760	Wow.
6621760	6624760	Boy, I hope you're prepared to go on the adventure of your life.
6624760	6628760	I hope you're prepared to keep paying me.
6628760	6633760	Beyond the double price that we paid you?
6633760	6637760	That's the Baskins guarantee.
6637760	6639760	That we have to keep paying you?
6639760	6642760	That's the Baskins guarantee.
6642760	6645760	But, boy, how often do we pay you on this?
6645760	6647760	You know, upon completion of the mission.
6647760	6649760	We'll feel it out.
6649760	6651760	All right, boy.
6651760	6654760	We're going to the Frost Giant City.
6654760	6655760	We gave you 40 gold.
6655760	6656760	Yeah, yeah.
6656760	6657760	We're going.
6657760	6659760	We're not giving you any more or anything ever.
6659760	6661760	Well, we already know where the Frost Giant City is.
6661760	6662760	We'll talk.
6662760	6663760	Exactly.
6663760	6666760	God, I feel like I'm at the cable car museum.
6666760	6668760	How long will it take to get there, Lil Baskins?
6668760	6671760	Several days, at least.
6671760	6673760	Lil Baskins.
6676760	6678760	What of your parentage?
6678760	6681760	Oh, I was born in a Baskin.
6681760	6683760	Is there a Mrs. Lil Baskins?
6683760	6684760	No, I'm a child.
6684760	6686760	Okay.
6687760	6689760	It's very... I don't know.
6689760	6691760	We have a robot baby.
6691760	6695760	Lil Baskins, let's start this journey post-haste.
6695760	6696760	All right.
6696760	6699760	Real quick, were you guys listening to Great Expectations
6699760	6701760	on tape before we arrived?
6701760	6702760	Lil Baskins.
6702760	6704760	When you dress a little boy in Dungeons and Dragons,
6704760	6706760	you take on a hottie tone.
6706760	6708760	You there, boy.
6708760	6711760	Sharpie, will you pay this boy?
6711760	6713760	I've paid him and then some.
6713760	6715760	Well, let's go.
6715760	6716760	You there, Lil Baskins.
6716760	6717760	Lead the way.
6717760	6720760	Let me just pack up my tent here and we'll be,
6720760	6723760	okay, let's go.
6723760	6727760	And you set off towards the mountains that I mentioned.
6727760	6729760	That's all, man.
6729760	6732760	We got so much fucking time that we've spent.
6732760	6734760	Oh, he's just pulling his plug.
6734760	6736760	I'm just pulling him.
6736760	6738760	All right, okay, that's it.
6738760	6741760	We're hangers.
6741760	6744760	Dungeons and Dragons.
6744760	6745760	Lil Baskins.
6745760	6747760	That's a lot of Dungeons and Dragons.
6747760	6748760	Lil Baskins.
6748760	6749760	That's a lot of Harlan.
6749760	6750760	That's a lot of town.
6750760	6751760	San Francisco.
6751760	6753760	Lil Baskins.
6753760	6756760	I do want to say before we thank everybody,
6756760	6760760	well, let's thank Rick and the Roxy for having us here.
6760760	6762760	Oh, Roxy, San Francisco.
6762760	6765760	Let's thank the people of San Francisco.
