0	20360	From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, Harbontown is now in session.
20360	27360	Spencer Crichton, everybody.
27360	34360	And the mayor of Harbontown, Dan Harmon.
34360	48080	Thank you, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
48080	50440	You're looking very smart in your camouflage hoodie, I like that.
50440	55720	I actually walked off the set of Great Minds wearing this, this isn't mine.
55720	56720	This is wardrobe?
57560	59360	I'm probably still wearing makeup, too.
59360	60360	What do I mean, probably?
60360	61360	I am still wearing makeup.
61360	65720	Are we allowed to know what this character is about?
65720	66720	I play Dan Harmon.
66720	68720	You play you, but like...
68720	75200	Oh, it's just finished shooting with Sarah Silverman as Betsy Ross, uh, yesterday was
75200	83440	Ron Funches as Edie Amin, and he's, I mean, well, Sarah's fantastic, I can sing her praises
83440	86320	lots, but Ron's new to our family.
86920	92880	My life, I knew he was adorable and cuddly and giggly, and we worked with him on a Harmon
92880	101640	quest, but yesterday, he, playing Edie Amin, he revealed a depth of dramatic chops that
101640	105560	was like, stunning, so I'm really looking for, I think that episode's gonna be great.
105560	108200	He's like, he's a great dramatic actor.
108200	111720	And I'm obviously a terrible comedy writer, if you'll find out he's a great dramatic
111720	115280	actor in my comedy show.
115280	119800	Um, okay, so here's some thoughts that I had.
119800	125840	So I find this hard to believe, so I have not, in this podcast, if I talked about the
125840	127800	Uber rape data leak?
127800	128800	No.
128800	131800	Okay, it seems like I would.
131800	138160	First of all, if you're a company, just strategically don't have rape data.
138160	146160	But sometimes, apparently, it's, if you're gonna, I was gonna, yeah, it's a big company,
146160	149920	it's been growing very quickly, and they have a customer service database, and there was
149920	156120	some, there was a kind of a, I don't know, semi-whistleblower customer service person
156120	164880	who, they leaked images, screenshots of the Uber customer service database with examples
164880	167920	of things that you would type in and how many results you'd get.
167920	172200	So if you type in the word rape, you get 5,583, something like that.
172200	176040	I think it's as many feet as there are in a mile.
176040	178000	That's my mnemonic device.
178000	185640	Over three years, but Uber released a rebuttal, which just, there's no good way to rebut this,
185640	194240	and they did not, like, find the good way, and they said, that is so misleading.
194240	201480	What if the driver or passenger is named Jason Rape?
201480	206960	That's the example, they said, what they said is, some drivers or users might have that
206960	212440	word in their last name, and the two examples they used in this order were, like Jason Rape
212440	213440	or Don Draper.
213440	218120	They should have started with Don Draper.
218120	222520	You should have started and finished with Don Draper.
222520	225840	Why did you create this Marvel villain?
225840	231600	I don't care if he exists and is driving for Uber to bury that lead.
231600	239840	Don Draper, the guy that thought of Don Draper in the Uber PR war room, promote that guy
239840	244760	and send him home early because you're done with that plank of your debate.
244760	248440	Don't then go, yeah, I mean, Jason Rape.
249440	254320	I would have started with Don Draper, then Alexander the Grape.
254320	255320	The honor pop flavor.
255320	259560	Well, this is the other thing they say, and not to mention colloquialisms in a complaint.
259560	261400	Someone might say, you raped my wallet.
261400	264400	Are you making that up or that's a real one?
264400	265400	I'm not making that up.
265400	266400	That was an Uber's rebuttal.
266400	267400	Wow.
267400	274040	They're just saying, hey, this is something, you know, look, it's not always, yeah, and
274040	275880	they said, that's over three years.
275880	279920	Also, by the way, the screenshots, I don't know if these defenses hold up for the phrase
279920	284960	sexual assault, which is also typed in and had thousands and thousands of, anyways, alright.
284960	287480	If you're a company, I mean, hey, I'm no Donald Trump.
287480	289080	I don't have a book on how to run a business.
289080	292400	I'm just saying, don't have rape data.
292400	296280	Just consider that, consider the existence of it at all to be a crisis.
296280	297280	Deal with it very quickly.
297280	301200	Do you think the person that came up with the name Don Draper from Mad Men thought of
301200	304280	like Don D. Raper?
304280	307200	Who knows?
307200	312840	But the other end of that spectrum is like, as we said at the end of the Cordray episode,
312840	319760	you know, our friend, the Uber driver, Abed, is, you know, seems to me, and I want to speculate
319760	324360	too widely or too quickly, but it just sort of sounds like he's the victim of some kind
324360	332680	of crazy entrapment sting operation, which must surely start from something, you know,
332680	337000	as much as we want to vilify Uber in the press probably because they target the press
337000	340960	and also because of the rape data.
340960	344360	But like also on the other side of that, it's like, well, where are we coming from?
344360	350200	We're coming from this crazy system where it's just like cities are in charge of medallions
350200	351360	and all that crap.
351360	356920	But thanks to Spencer, Uber, oh, sorry, Abed met his goal, like lickety-split.
356920	360200	I didn't even have time to tweak.
360200	361200	Yeah.
361720	367080	It's just from people who probably watched the live stream and people who knew about
367080	369040	it like just that day.
369040	375640	I saw your Facebook post about that, and I went on to do it, and you had not met the
375640	379600	goal when I was putting information in, and by the end of it, it was way over.
379600	381080	Like, that's how fast it was coming in.
381080	382080	It was really great.
382080	384480	That's very cool of you, Spencer, to take that out.
384480	385880	I thought that was smart thinking.
385880	387280	No, it's not me.
387280	388280	It's, you know.
388280	390520	No, I'm saying like, no, it absolutely was you.
390520	391520	Who is it?
391520	392520	What?
392520	395120	It's the kindness of all the people who donated.
395120	396120	Well, certainly.
396120	397120	Oh, fuck those people.
397120	398120	No, no.
398120	400920	No, but he means like you put, you made it easy for them to do it.
400920	406200	Yeah, I opened the door so kindness can pour through and bathe Abed in compassion.
406200	409040	Yeah, that's nothing.
409040	410200	I wouldn't have thought to do it.
410200	412720	I wasn't, I didn't think about it.
412720	417200	I was so happy listening to an episode because that happened, and then Rob Cordray, we find
417200	420480	out that he is in love with everybody.
420920	422920	He was sad, and it totally wasn't here.
422920	424920	That made me so happy.
424920	432640	Alright, so is there a way to turn off comments on Instagram, and if so, would you?
432640	433640	You could delete comments.
433640	435880	I don't want to delete no comments.
435880	436880	That's like reading them.
436880	437880	What?
437880	438880	Who hurt your feelings?
438880	439880	What was it?
439880	440880	No, nobody did.
440880	444800	Honestly, Instagram is the one place where it's like, because I don't, I'm not a photographer.
444800	447000	I'm not into, I don't paint with light.
447000	453640	I just, I'll do it.
453640	456120	Clearly from that sentence, you paint with words.
456120	457120	Correct.
457120	458120	Yes.
458120	462440	Photographers don't even know they're allowed to say that about themselves.
462440	465680	They're too busy painting with light.
465680	470800	There's a lesser known but more valid saying about me.
470800	475240	My words are worth a thousand pictures.
475240	476640	But each of them.
477240	484200	So, so if I take a picture, it's worth, what's a thousand times a thousand?
484200	485200	Ten.
485200	486200	Nope.
486200	487200	Wow.
487200	489080	Your picture would be worth it with one word.
489080	490080	Oh no.
490080	491080	Oh shit.
491080	492080	Divided by a thousand?
492080	493080	I don't know.
493080	494080	I'm mad at math.
494080	495080	We'll be right back.
495080	496080	We're gonna.
496080	498080	Gold Bond powder.
498080	500120	No, it's absolutely not.
500120	504560	There's nobody, I'm not, I'm not Kim Kardashian, so I don't, I don't, who I've, you know, like,
504560	506080	like there's people who I'm sure.
506080	508440	Just let yourself short, Dan.
508440	513600	Like she'll post a picture of herself like sleeping or waking up or be like, I'm waking
513600	517320	up and then the top comment will just be like slut or something.
517320	518600	I don't have that problem.
518600	524640	I, I, I, I, people aren't trying to hurt me generally and then the ones that are, I just,
524640	525640	you know what?
525640	527040	It's, it's the, it's the funny people.
527040	531560	I don't, I just say, I was, I don't, I don't like, cause I take a picture, I'll take a
531560	535840	picture of a, of a silly thing and I'll go like, this is why this is silly.
535840	538920	And then, and then it's just like, like not even like.
538920	540920	People pointing out the joke that you told with the picture.
540920	544800	Yeah, just like now I'll try that joke, but I'm not, I'm not, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna
544800	549500	quite land it and it's, I don't know why that makes me angry.
549500	552240	It makes me angry.
552240	556320	You know, it's not a popular stance of me.
556320	558240	This is like, like, like, I swear, I mean.
558240	563320	There's some people on my comment section where it's always the exact same comment every
563320	564320	time.
564320	574040	And it's just, what, what, what people don't know is that we have a were turkey.
574040	578080	Half turkey, half, half man.
578080	583480	It's the first day of spring and yeah, that's our, that's a new Harman town tradition, the,
583480	589560	the spring turkeys here to spread his, his turkey eggs of, of renewed life.
589560	592160	Isn't that the worst thing to, to make fun of somebody's laughter?
593160	594520	Everybody should laugh however they want to.
594520	602080	Well, yes, but most people, but I just want to balance the scales and say that person,
602080	605840	that person's timing and nature of that laugh, I'm going to say it was in mockery.
605840	609400	No, they were like, you guys are idiots.
609400	614040	I think I felt a little bit of that person had like, like half a five hour energy down
614040	616480	their throat and then laughed at the same time.
616480	617480	Yeah.
617480	618480	But think about what they would have been laughing at.
618480	620760	It wasn't like you were like, Mack, Mack, who's there, Santa Claus is underwear.
620760	626160	You were like, there's so many people who like to see every time and they're like, oh,
626160	628640	my, I think they were like, Oh, what is this?
628640	632840	The grandpa grandpa show or like what a complaints about it.
632840	633840	I don't know.
633840	634840	Or the were turkey is there.
634840	635840	Oh shit.
635840	636840	That's me.
636840	637840	He's talking about me.
637840	638840	Yeah.
638840	639840	Oh yeah.
639840	640840	I always, I always type in gobble gobble.
640840	643600	Oh, you know, you know what it might've been.
643600	645600	It's six people who came together.
645600	649760	The person who laughed is the friend of a friend of a friend who does that.
649760	650760	Oh, oh yeah.
650760	651760	Yeah.
651760	652760	Yeah.
652760	653760	Yeah.
653760	654760	Yes.
654760	655760	I'm sorry.
655760	656760	Yes.
656760	657760	Yes.
657760	658760	But the, the, the friend of a friend of, right.
658760	659760	Yeah.
659760	660760	The person that laughed is like, I was just complaining about Steve.
660760	661760	Yes.
661760	662760	Oh my God.
662760	665720	Like, like, like, like, like, like, because, because, because the person that shorted the
665720	671680	were turkey went, went to Trisha, let's add some gender balance to the story.
671680	672680	All right.
672680	678360	Trisha's the Trisha's the Lestat of this group of six that came here tonight.
678360	684000	And Damien, the, the, the, the were turkey went up to Trisha and said, are you really
684000	685480	bringing Steven?
685480	690960	He, he, he, he, he mono, he mono comments on Instagram.
690960	694600	He's he's an, he's an Instagram mono commenter.
694600	697040	He mono comments on Instagram.
697040	699640	And Stephanie was like, I think you're judgmental.
699640	702080	And I'm not saying anything like that to him.
702080	705560	And you need to think about friendship and no one shares that point of view.
705560	712160	But then the cloud comes away from the moon and the moon comes out and you're, that's
712160	713160	it.
713160	717520	You're just, I mean, this is, I thought, well, yeah, I mean, can, can any animal be aware?
717520	718520	Can you be aware anything?
718520	720000	Can you be aware like sardine?
720000	721000	Yeah.
721000	722000	Yeah.
722000	723000	Anything.
723000	724000	Yeah.
724000	725000	Any animal can have like hand therapy.
725000	726840	I want to see a movie about a were turkey.
726840	727840	Yeah.
727840	733480	But I want to know, is it always a person that gets bit by, by something in the, before
733480	739280	you even get into the biting, like, is it always a person that turns into sardine?
739280	741840	Is it different when a sardine turns into a person?
741840	744520	Oh, like, like a sardine can be aware.
744520	749420	Does the animal kingdom have their own version of where things that they do?
749420	752080	Because the where is the person part and then the animal part.
752080	753080	Sorry.
753080	754080	What?
754080	757480	So it was aware, man.
757480	760280	Oh, was that the native American like reservation thing?
760280	761280	No.
762280	763280	Kumail was it?
763280	770080	Oh, they knew X-Files has like a where man or wouldn't that be like a, he was a lizard.
770080	771080	Who turns into a guy?
771080	772080	Yeah.
772080	773080	All right.
773080	778880	Well, you know, I mean, I'm not pitching stuff up here.
778880	781160	I'm asking questions.
781160	783160	I wasn't going to run out the door and make a movie.
783160	784160	No.
784160	788160	I mean, you might've, you might've, well, if there had been silence, I might've.
788160	789160	So thank you.
790160	794160	Can anybody say, has there been a where Turkey today?
794160	795160	Yeah.
795160	796160	I doubt it.
796160	798160	We own that intellectual property.
798160	799160	Okay.
799160	801160	So you guys see spotlight this movie.
801160	803160	I think there's a little movie.
803160	806160	But did you guys watch all the way to the end of the credits?
806160	807160	Yeah.
807160	808160	Yeah.
808160	812160	Well, there's a whole thing after the credits, you know, all done by Wallace and Gromit.
812160	818660	It's you know how the guy, you know, that guy that leans on Michael Keaton in the bar,
818660	821160	that scene where Michael Keaton goes, is this how it works?
821160	822160	A guy leans on a guy.
822160	823660	And then all of a sudden, remember that scene?
823660	824660	That guy.
824660	826860	And that guy says like, so what are you going to do?
826860	831660	You know, Marty Baron, he does this in Miami, he does this in Cleveland, he does it now
831660	832660	here now.
832660	833660	He's going to be gone in a couple of years.
833660	834660	Where are you going to go?
834660	835660	Something to think about.
835660	836660	And then he leaves.
836660	837660	You remember that scene?
837660	838660	Yeah.
838660	845660	After the credits, if you keep watching all of spotlight all the way through the credits,
845660	846660	there's a bonus scene.
846660	848420	I haven't watched it yet.
849420	851420	And it's that guy again.
851420	857420	He comes up to Michael Keaton in the bar and he goes, well, where are you going to go?
857420	862420	Because, you know, and Michael Keaton goes, Rome.
862420	865420	And the guy's like, good one.
865420	867420	And I wouldn't be surprised.
867420	870420	And Michael Keaton's like, and he starts walking away.
870420	872420	And then the camera stays on that guy and he starts drinking.
872420	874420	And then he does a double take.
874420	876420	He's like, whoa.
876420	878420	And then the camera whips over.
878420	880420	And Michael Keaton is walking away.
880420	882420	And what you thought was his napkin.
882420	886420	He places it on his head and it's a giant white hat.
886420	893420	And he turns to the camera and he pulls two cords in his suit jacket, which turns into
893420	895420	long robes.
895420	899420	And then in a move I can only describe, I can't imitate.
899420	905420	I don't know if they use CG to make this possible, but he does a genuflect that where
906420	911420	the horizontal part of the cross is him removing a mask.
911420	918420	So I can't do it quite right when it's like.
918420	921420	So when I do it, it just looks like I went like this and then removed a mask.
921420	924420	But I guess Michael Keaton studied the Vatican.
924420	925420	He unzips it.
925420	927420	This is the unzipping of the part of the mask.
927420	929420	And that's the pulling off of the mask, right?
929420	930420	Yeah.
930420	934420	Anyways, revealing that Michael Keaton was the Pope the whole movie.
934420	939420	And I'm raising a ton more questions for Spotlight 2.
939420	946420	So just stay until after the credits when you watch these movies, you know, you guys,
946420	948420	you know, you should be watching them anyway.
948420	952420	Like, you know, the grip, the grip worked hard on that.
952420	954420	That's your little reward.
954420	959420	Now you know that Michael Keaton was the Pope in that movie.
960420	964420	Mark Ruffalo is like on Ruffalo, like level 10 in that movie.
964420	968420	So he's making his little Ruffalo kissy faces.
968420	970420	Mark Ruffalo can't.
970420	972420	The entire movie is scenes.
972420	977420	Mark Ruffalo comes into him, sits down and hunches and puts his head at the Ruffalo angle.
977420	982420	And then he was like, I guess he did a character.
982420	988420	So tell us why they fuck the children, Marty.
989420	993420	And he makes his little Ruffalo kissy lips and you just want to fuck.
993420	998420	I mean, I'm on record as I want to have make love to this man.
998420	1003420	But he's extra adorable because he's doing an impression of some real guy who must be like,
1003420	1005420	imagine being that guy.
1005420	1007420	Like talk about it.
1007420	1009420	You've got to use that date wisely.
1009420	1012420	Yeah, let's go see a movie.
1012420	1015420	Oh, oh, oh, I forgot this movie.
1015420	1018420	Oh, is this the one? This movie is about me.
1018420	1019420	Oh, yeah.
1019420	1021420	Oh, that's me. Mark Ruffalo is playing me.
1021420	1024420	Oh, yeah, I'm yelling at Michael Keaton and screaming.
1024420	1027420	How many degrees is the sexiest Mark Ruffalo angle?
1027420	1030420	Like, like, like, like, like 30 degrees?
1030420	1032420	You mean like when he, I don't know.
1032420	1034420	I mean, he's sexy all the time.
1034420	1037420	But he's got those very pouty lips.
1037420	1044420	Well, I said to my girlfriend, I tried to figure out like how to describe what's going on.
1044420	1050420	Mark Ruffalo's standing face when he's not like kissing, making little chissies or talking.
1050420	1053420	And his standing face in spotlight is,
1053420	1059420	Mommy just finished giving me medicine.
1059420	1067420	Like he just, he just, like the spoon just left frame that had like Dymatap on it.
1067420	1070420	And he's like, he can't, you know, he doesn't know if it's good or bad yet.
1070420	1079420	But...
1079420	1084420	Subscribe to Harmon Town so you can see this face on the live stream.
1084420	1090420	Because he's doing a very good kissy face, Mark Ruffalo, right now.
1090420	1099420	Boy, that's a lot. Those priests, that's a lot of, that's a lot of fucking...
1100420	1103420	At the end of the movie, there's no spoilers.
1103420	1107420	It's a, you know, the spoilers are, yeah.
1107420	1109420	But at the end, you know at the end when it's like,
1109420	1113420	Oh, there, the phones are ringing.
1113420	1117420	Uh, up here? No.
1117420	1121420	Shit, I thought there'd be phones ringing.
1121420	1126420	We sent the phone answers downstairs.
1126420	1128420	Downstairs.
1128420	1130420	Brrrring!
1130420	1134420	Whoa, the phones were ringing.
1134420	1138420	And it's got the...
1138420	1142420	Where's Turkey's girlfriend?
1142420	1146420	See, I have the screener sitting on my dining room table.
1146420	1148420	That was very rude, ma'am.
1148420	1152420	Why didn't I cast you as Where Turkey's Girlfriend? That's fucked up.
1152420	1156420	Why do you have to be She-Hulk? Why can't you have your own franchise?
1156420	1158420	That's Generation X, I'm sorry.
1158420	1162420	Millennial, that was just a new lady.
1162420	1164420	Do you think Where Turkey's Girlfriend? She doesn't even know him.
1164420	1168420	Do you think Where Turkey's Girlfriend is aware of something else or just a regular person?
1168420	1172420	Like, do you think that Where Turkey is just dating some regular woman?
1172420	1175420	Oh, no way. I mean, like, it's gotta be like, the Marvel Universe.
1175420	1178420	I'm sure she's got a tail or, I don't know.
1178420	1182420	She could see through hate or something.
1182420	1186420	That would be the worst power in today's society.
1186420	1191420	I could see through their hate and they're like, well, that's the problem.
1191420	1196420	We're trying to detect the hate. No, it seems to me like everything's fine.
1196420	1199420	Are you sure you have a superpower?
1199420	1200420	Yes.
1200420	1204420	I think you might just be blind to crime.
1204420	1206420	Well, yeah, but...
1206420	1209420	Yeah, I can see any crime that doesn't involve hate.
1209420	1212420	Wait, what was I talking about? I was talking about something important.
1212420	1216420	Oh, oh, oh, oh. So weren't you thinking at the end of the movie because all the phones were ringing?
1216420	1219420	Because it was like, and the guy comes up and he goes like,
1219420	1223420	or somebody lowers the phone for a second, the phones were ringing.
1223420	1226420	They're all victims, all of them.
1226420	1229420	And I just thought the next shot would be Michael Keaton going,
1229420	1232420	well, tell him thanks, but that ship's kind of sailed.
1232420	1235420	We already did the story.
1236420	1240420	We get it. A priest talked to you.
1240420	1244420	We know. We exposed it.
1244420	1247420	Now you read it in the paper. You want to tell the world.
1247420	1251420	The paper told the world. Get your own paper.
1251420	1256420	But then it says in the next five years they did 600 more stories.
1256420	1261420	Okay. Well, I guess that's how the newspapers work. I don't know.
1262420	1266420	Do you think the Catholic church has been chastened by that?
1266420	1269420	Well, I think, well, I don't know. I was going to laugh.
1269420	1272420	I was going to scoff and say like, oh yeah, look at him.
1272420	1275420	But I don't know. I don't know anything about that shit.
1275420	1279420	I never, I never, I was shocked. That was the most,
1279420	1283420	the shocking thing to me wasn't the shocking things in that movie.
1283420	1288420	The shocking thing was like how Catholic people still are.
1288420	1291420	Like in the modern world, like you hear that stuff,
1291420	1294420	but it just seems like a kind of like fifties stickball on the street
1294420	1295420	and like kind of thing.
1295420	1298420	But this is a story that takes place in the modern world
1298420	1300420	and the church is a part of their lives.
1300420	1303420	And it's honestly like, I don't know nothing about nothing.
1303420	1309420	All right. So Amazon package mix up.
1309420	1312420	I got a dog sitter. She does very well.
1312420	1313420	She's there all the time.
1313420	1315420	That's what makes her a good dog sitter. I'm very busy.
1315420	1318420	So, you know, and I'm also ordering a lot of Amazon stuff
1318420	1321420	because I'm in a new relationship.
1321420	1325420	I'll put a pin in that.
1325420	1327420	Well, it's kind of, I mean, that's the thing is like,
1327420	1331420	I see an Amazon package and I'm like, oh boy.
1331420	1332420	Because it might be.
1332420	1334420	Because it might be like an outfit.
1334420	1337420	And then I'm like, I rip it open and I'm like,
1337420	1339420	what are these, what are these gold Nikes?
1339420	1340420	And it's like, oh, it's my God shit.
1340420	1343420	I just opened someone's Amazon package because of my dog sitter.
1343420	1345420	So now I got, so the thing is.
1345420	1347420	She's having her own Amazon stuff sent to your place.
1347420	1348420	Which makes sense. Good.
1348420	1351420	I'd rather that, that to me is a sign that she's.
1351420	1355420	Your dog sitter has gold Nikes.
1355420	1358420	Fuck it.
1358420	1361420	You have, you have made it, bro.
1361420	1365420	My dog sitter's dog sitter has gold Nikes.
1365420	1368420	Dan, if somebody told you 25 years ago
1368420	1370420	when you were in a shitty apartment in Milwaukee,
1370420	1373420	that you had a dog sitter to start, that'd be one thing.
1373420	1375420	You would never consider.
1375420	1376420	The dogs?
1376420	1379420	And I'm not eating them?
1379420	1380420	No, they're pets.
1380420	1382420	You let them just hang out.
1382420	1385420	You buy them food.
1385420	1388420	What?
1388420	1391420	But it sounds like I'll be stuck at home walking these dogs
1391420	1392420	and picking up their poop all the time.
1392420	1395420	Bro, bro, wake up to capitalism.
1395420	1398420	You got someone paid to hang out with your dogs
1398420	1399420	and you buy her food too.
1399420	1402420	Yeah, but she's probably just walking around in some flip flops
1402420	1403420	like being all bummed out.
1403420	1411420	That bitch gets gold Nikes.
1411420	1414420	Her feet never touch the earth.
1414420	1418420	She was raised above ground in a harness
1418420	1422420	surrounded by images of well fed dogs
1422420	1425420	and told that was the ordinary world.
1425420	1428420	And then periodically there would be a dog
1428420	1432420	that needed to be fed during which she'd get an electric shock.
1432420	1434420	Then she was dropped to the earth, a door opened,
1434420	1437420	and it turned out she was in my backyard in a tent
1437420	1439420	and now she goes into my home.
1439420	1441420	Wait, she's a dog worker, but she doesn't even touch the earth.
1441420	1442420	She's not even walking.
1442420	1446420	During the raising of her, she's like, veal is my metaphor.
1446420	1448420	Or Kobe beef.
1448420	1451420	Aren't her muscles so flabby
1451420	1453420	that she can't even really walk a dog anymore?
1453420	1455420	That's why you got the gold Nikes, so she floats around.
1455420	1458420	Don't, don't, don't body shame her.
1458420	1465420	Why not just get your...
1465420	1467420	Cha-ching.
1467420	1468420	People listening.
1468420	1476420	Ireland's podcast up 3% on the shame watchers report card.
1476420	1479420	Why not just get, if you really make it,
1479420	1481420	get your dogs some gold Nikes.
1481420	1482420	They walked themselves.
1482420	1484420	Don't dog shame me.
1484420	1485420	Doesn't work as well.
1485420	1488420	Well, it didn't work the first time, but you made a face on camera.
1488420	1489420	Ouch!
1489420	1491420	Yeah, like, people listening are going to think that joke was hilarious,
1491420	1495420	but the audience didn't dig it until you made a face after the body shaming.
1495420	1502420	Don't comedy shame me.
1502420	1505420	Yes.
1505420	1506420	He's not making a face.
1506420	1513420	That joke was that funny.
1513420	1517420	All right, politics corner.
1517420	1519420	And then we're going to bring out our friends.
1519420	1526420	So tell them...
1526420	1527420	Just for a second.
1527420	1529420	This was on Harvey Fierstein's Facebook page,
1529420	1532420	and I found it kind of uplifting in an apolitical way.
1532420	1535420	It's going to sound very political, very specific.
1535420	1538420	Real quick, do you follow him, or is this something that...
1538420	1541420	I saw this, no, I found this third, fourth, fifth hand,
1541420	1544420	but this was on his Facebook page is where he shared it.
1544420	1546420	Because at first I was like, wait, was he on a talk show?
1546420	1550420	Because, goddamn, if he's this eloquent, like, he's just rapping.
1550420	1554420	But, I mean, he has a playwright, and he has fire in his name.
1554420	1555420	He just...
1555420	1557420	I don't know.
1557420	1560420	I liked this because I was like, you know what,
1560420	1562420	for three months I haven't been thinking this way.
1562420	1563420	I don't know.
1563420	1566420	He's...
1566420	1568420	Keep telling people why you're going to share it.
1568420	1570420	Just share it, you fucking tub of shit.
1571420	1574420	Watching our people protest Trump today,
1574420	1577420	I have to say that I don't understand what we're doing.
1577420	1580420	I understand that we must always speak out against intolerance and bigotry
1580420	1583420	and anyone who would destroy American values to ensure their own profits,
1583420	1587420	but at this moment, why are we doing the Republicans' job for them?
1587420	1590420	They created Trump, they earned him.
1590420	1592420	As if their hateful rhetoric wasn't enough,
1592420	1594420	just in how they treated our president,
1594420	1598420	they earned Trump with every racist slight, every homophobic slander,
1598420	1601420	every manufactured semi-automatic weapon and oil spill
1601420	1603420	and fracking disaster and shuttered women's clinic
1603420	1605420	and attack on affordable health care.
1605420	1608420	The Republican leadership built this Frankenstein monster.
1608420	1611420	Let the monster they created and nurtured destroy them.
1613420	1617420	What do you think they'll do if we manage to dump Trump?
1617420	1619420	They'll only turn around and give us the next horror
1619420	1621420	from their arsenal of selfish intolerance.
1621420	1623420	Look who they have to offer America.
1623420	1624420	Next up is...
1624420	1626420	Ted Cruz.
1626420	1628420	Who scares Spencer Moore?
1629420	1630420	Mostly his face.
1630420	1631420	And then I saw his face.
1631420	1633420	Yeah, he looks like a silly putty on a radiator.
1633420	1634420	Yeah.
1636420	1637420	Which is not...
1637420	1641420	I mean, you can be ugly and be president.
1641420	1642420	It's fine.
1643420	1645420	There was a neurologist who did a study
1645420	1648420	on why his face instantly makes you unhappy.
1650420	1651420	People in that one, they smiled.
1651420	1655420	And they isolated it to the things coming out of the mouth region.
1656420	1658420	As waves of sound.
1658420	1660420	When he smiles, his eyebrows did the opposite
1660420	1662420	of what happy people's eyebrows do,
1662420	1663420	and his mouth doesn't make...
1663420	1665420	And somebody was asked...
1665420	1669420	Somebody was asked, like, one of his, like, old colleagues said,
1669420	1672420	Why do people instantly hate Ted Cruz?
1672420	1674420	And his answer was, Because it saves time.
1678420	1679420	That's great.
1680420	1681420	I like that guy.
1682420	1683420	Yeah.
1684420	1686420	Politics will take us into two hours of stuff,
1686420	1688420	but let's bring out...
1688420	1690420	Was that the end of that...
1690420	1692420	Well, he's asked a couple more thoughts,
1692420	1694420	but really they're mostly just about how Ted Cruz is a piece of shit,
1694420	1696420	but I just found that kind of...
1696420	1697420	I don't know what it was.
1697420	1699420	If I try to articulate it, I won't.
1699420	1701420	I'm not reading that because I'm like,
1701420	1703420	Oh my God, what a new revelation about Trump.
1703420	1704420	It's actually a revelation about...
1704420	1706420	The idea that we hate people that incite violence
1706420	1709420	at their presidential campaign rally,
1709420	1712420	and then so people are going to go out and cause more violence.
1712420	1714420	No, let them implode.
1714420	1716420	Let them eat themselves.
1716420	1717420	Well, I wouldn't...
1717420	1721420	I guess I'd be a sliver over to a different side of that.
1721420	1725420	I think it's more like,
1725420	1729420	Well, that party...
1729420	1732420	What was that that lady said on that panel thing?
1732420	1734420	Like, you were listening to the show,
1734420	1737420	and it almost was like she stumbled into saying something
1737420	1738420	that you're not even supposed to say.
1738420	1739420	Yeah.
1739420	1741420	Someone can tell me.
1741420	1742420	I'll get the name wrong.
1742420	1745420	A panel of Republicans that were basically talking about the Trump problem.
1745420	1747420	It's one of the female Republican senators
1747420	1749420	who has a lot of media quotes these days,
1749420	1752420	but she said like Trump is forcing the Republican Party
1752420	1755420	to re-examine its core beliefs,
1755420	1758420	and that's something we definitely don't want to have happen.
1758420	1761420	Like they're talking about examination of their core beliefs,
1761420	1763420	like it's the China syndrome,
1763420	1765420	which is, I mean, I think that is a beautiful thing
1765420	1768420	because it's like I don't know how much scrutiny
1768420	1771420	the Democratic Party would hold up.
1771420	1774420	I don't know any political gigantic party that represents...
1774420	1777420	Like nothing that big would hold up to any scrutiny
1777420	1779420	in terms of core beliefs, but my God.
1779420	1783420	I mean, you know, there's a lesser of evils
1783420	1785420	or, you know, shit stinks more than piss.
1785420	1787420	I don't know what to say.
1787420	1792420	But it is funny because he's like this Mordred
1792420	1794420	that is born out of this like weird slime
1794420	1797420	that drips out of the machine that they've been cranking on,
1797420	1799420	and the machine is really built on dishonesty
1799420	1803420	because you can't be a financial elitist
1803420	1805420	and expect a majority vote.
1805420	1807420	So you have to do all these weird gears
1807420	1809420	and Rube Goldberg kind of contraptions
1809420	1813420	that link financial elitism to homophobia,
1813420	1816420	which doesn't make any sense.
1816420	1819420	First of all, gay people are rich beyond belief.
1819420	1821420	Whatever. Let's forget it.
1821420	1822420	Let's just talk to our guests.
1822420	1824420	You can listen to this shit on other podcasts.
1824420	1827420	I wanted to share Harvey Fierstein's words
1827420	1829420	because I found them with a strange kind of strange,
1829420	1833420	a little spoonful of Dymatap for the Mark Ruffalo kissy face.
1833420	1836420	It just felt good going down, made my eyebrows wiggle,
1836420	1838420	and made my head got to the side
1838420	1842420	and made me ask questions about fucking kids.
1842420	1844420	Are you auditioning for Mad TV this week?
1844420	1846420	What's going on?
1846420	1851420	What other celebrity impressions have you got?
1851420	1855420	You got to show Jeff Harried Chopper.
1855420	1857420	Whoa!
1857420	1860420	It's usually better.
1860420	1864420	All right, let's bring out our next guest.
1864420	1866420	Again, we keep having him back
1866420	1868420	because the audience seems to like him.
1868420	1870420	Please welcome Rob Schraub.
1871420	1873420	They like it more than you.
1873420	1875420	That was a louder cheer.
1888420	1890420	He brought the vodka.
1895420	1897420	We didn't even know that.
1898420	1901420	We didn't even realize that there wasn't any vodka on stage
1901420	1903420	until Rob came out.
1903420	1905420	Yeah, I've got a full glass.
1905420	1911420	I heard that the reason that we got rid of the Spider-Man bucket
1911420	1914420	was because it was rusted,
1914420	1917420	and you guys were drinking that.
1917420	1927420	And so we have like this lovely dish right here
1927420	1929420	full of ice and cup.
1933420	1937420	A little bit of backstage trivia.
1937420	1941420	Do you think you can get tetanus from ice out of a rusty bucket?
1941420	1942420	What happens when you drink rest
1942420	1944420	because they make flasks out of metal?
1944420	1947420	We're going to find out in about a month.
1949420	1951420	Rob, do you know what a rusty bucket is?
1951420	1953420	No, I don't, Jeff.
1953420	1955420	That's when I poop on your chest.
1955420	1958420	Why didn't you save 50 bucks, same as downtown?
1958420	1961420	Twenty dollars, same as in town.
1961420	1965420	All right, settle down.
1965420	1967420	Dan's going to say something.
1967420	1969420	Here we go.
1969420	1971420	Here's an observation I came up with
1971420	1974420	that I think you'll enjoy.
1974420	1977420	Sometimes I come up with little thoughts and things,
1977420	1979420	and then I hear myself say them, and I go,
1979420	1982420	Bye, golly.
1982420	1986420	That should go on like a Dave Barry calendar.
1986420	1989420	Too long to tweet, too good to not share.
1989420	1990420	Yeah.
1990420	1994420	This is this segment called Harman's Gems.
1994420	1996420	Harman's Charmons.
1996420	1998420	Harman's Charmons.
1998420	1999420	Wow.
1999420	2001420	The ladies liked that one.
2005420	2006420	They really did.
2006420	2009420	The guys were, nope.
2009420	2011420	Not all the ladies.
2011420	2014420	Some ladies, all the people that liked that were ladies.
2014420	2017420	It would be a logical fallacy to say the ladies liked that.
2017420	2019420	Ladies like apostrophes.
2019420	2021420	Should we talk about how much louder people cheered
2021420	2023420	for Rob Schrapp's entrance than yours,
2023420	2025420	or mine, or Spencer's, or anybody's?
2025420	2027420	I mean, I told them to.
2027420	2029420	By saying, you know, I play into it.
2029420	2030420	Right.
2030420	2031420	He's in my control.
2031420	2032420	Right.
2032420	2033420	I'm not sweating it.
2033420	2034420	Absolutely.
2034420	2035420	I don't feel threatened.
2035420	2036420	He drives me here.
2036420	2039420	He tells me what to think.
2040420	2043420	So, best reason to go to therapy.
2043420	2046420	If for no other reason, so, you know,
2046420	2049420	achieving mental health, great.
2049420	2050420	That's way up there on the list.
2050420	2053420	But I came up with a new one.
2053420	2056420	Good reason to go to therapy.
2057420	2059420	If you pay for therapy...
2059420	2062420	Wait, sorry, let me start over.
2064420	2066420	If you're not...
2066420	2068420	If you're not paying for therapy,
2068420	2071420	you can't complain about how crazy you are.
2072420	2074420	If you are, you can.
2074420	2076420	So, like, if I go,
2076420	2078420	hey, Rob, fuck you, you piece of shit.
2078420	2079420	Oh, man, that's terrible.
2079420	2081420	I know, right?
2081420	2086420	What a rip-off.
2086420	2088420	I mean, you think you got problems,
2088420	2089420	you fucking turd.
2089420	2092420	I'm getting ripped off of therapy.
2092420	2094420	I can't believe I just said that to you,
2094420	2097420	you monster cock-knoblin,
2097420	2100420	jizz-blasting fuck-nut.
2100420	2103420	Did you just call him a cock-knoblin,
2103420	2105420	jizz-blasting fuck-nut?
2105420	2106420	Yeah.
2106420	2108420	But am I in a good way?
2108420	2110420	What do you...
2110420	2114420	Am I blasting jizz when I'm knobbling a cock?
2114420	2115420	Is that what it is?
2115420	2116420	What are you spending your money on
2116420	2117420	in the therapy session?
2117420	2119420	I know, right?
2121420	2124420	Can you explain to me what a cock-knobbler does?
2124420	2128420	Like, give me a day in the life of a cock-knobbler.
2128420	2131420	What's a cock-knob-less do?
2131420	2134420	I know what a regular knobbler is.
2134420	2135420	No, I don't.
2135420	2137420	But for the people who don't.
2138420	2140420	Explain.
2140420	2142420	Oh, yeah, tell me what a...
2142420	2144420	Just your work-a-day knobbler does.
2144420	2146420	I'll connect the dots after that.
2146420	2149420	What's a day in the life of a knobbler?
2150420	2152420	I mean, I know what a jizz-blaster does.
2152420	2153420	Yeah.
2158420	2159420	You know what I...
2159420	2160420	I think I got thrown on the word knobbling.
2160420	2161420	I don't know what...
2161420	2162420	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2162420	2164420	Is that somebody who makes barrels?
2164420	2166420	It's like the cobbler's mixed shoes.
2166420	2168420	Coopers make barrels.
2168420	2170420	A knobbler makes doors.
2170420	2172420	Coogers make barrels.
2172420	2174420	Yeah, coopersmith.
2174420	2175420	Coopersmith, right?
2175420	2176420	Or that's a font.
2176420	2177420	No, that's a font.
2177420	2178420	Cooper makes barrels.
2178420	2179420	Cobblers make shoes.
2179420	2180420	Coopers make barrels.
2180420	2181420	Right.
2181420	2182420	Knobblers make doors, is it?
2182420	2183420	Yeah, doors.
2183420	2186420	Okay, so he's a cock-knobbler.
2186420	2187420	Yeah.
2187420	2189420	So he puts a door on your dick?
2190420	2191420	Yeah.
2192420	2193420	Fuck him.
2193420	2194420	Am I right?
2196420	2197420	Guilty as charged.
2199420	2202420	I cut my balls with the scissors today.
2202420	2203420	What?
2211420	2212420	I'm sorry.
2212420	2214420	Would you please repeat that?
2214420	2216420	No, I don't want to talk about it.
2218420	2219420	No, okay.
2220420	2221420	So...
2223420	2224420	Were you trimming your balls?
2224420	2225420	I was doing...
2225420	2228420	Yeah, I was doing some pubic maintenance.
2230420	2232420	Without my glasses.
2234420	2236420	Which was not a good idea.
2236420	2238420	We're getting old, aren't we?
2238420	2239420	Yeah.
2242420	2244420	Well, the thing is...
2246420	2252420	The thing is, I never had to really keep up with the Joneses.
2256420	2260420	But as you, you know, I'm 46 and, you know...
2260420	2263420	I mean, it's interesting, like, you know...
2263420	2266420	I mean, I've been bald since I was 19, but, you know, everybody...
2266420	2268420	Jesus Christ.
2268420	2269420	Wear tricky.
2269420	2271420	The wear tricky was bad.
2277420	2278420	Holy shit.
2278420	2279420	There's a wear tricky out there.
2279420	2280420	Oh my God.
2281420	2282420	Okay, so...
2282420	2283420	Yes, it was really tragic.
2283420	2284420	It was hard.
2284420	2285420	Now...
2285420	2286420	It was sad.
2286420	2288420	Really, really painful to go through.
2288420	2290420	So you won't...
2290420	2293420	Walk us through this tragedy.
2293420	2300420	Well, I made an agreement with Kate, my lovely wife, that I would, you know, keep up, you know, appearances and...
2302420	2303420	You know, I was...
2303420	2304420	When did you make that agreement?
2304420	2306420	I officiated your wedding.
2308420	2309420	You left that part out.
2309420	2310420	Well, I...
2310420	2311420	You wrote your own vows.
2311420	2312420	I don't know.
2312420	2315420	Just recently, everything just kind of went into overdrive.
2316420	2317420	Wait.
2317420	2318420	Wait.
2318420	2319420	More...
2319420	2320420	Wait.
2320420	2321420	Recently?
2321420	2322420	Like, I have this to look forward to next year.
2322420	2323420	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2323420	2324420	Well, you know, back.
2324420	2326420	How does pubic hair go into overdrive?
2326420	2327420	It just gets...
2327420	2328420	It's already...
2328420	2329420	More.
2329420	2330420	It's because he's a cock nobbler.
2330420	2331420	There's a door.
2332420	2333420	This is terrifying.
2333420	2335420	When that door opens, more...
2335420	2336420	No, no, no.
2336420	2337420	Everything...
2337420	2338420	It's just your arms, your shoulders, your back.
2338420	2340420	Yeah, I got the check, check, check.
2340420	2341420	Yeah.
2341420	2346420	Well, you probably have as much as I do right now, so you don't have to worry about it.
2346420	2350420	I think there's only one way to find out.
2351420	2352420	All right.
2352420	2359420	Things started going into overdrive so much that there was a family meeting about it.
2359420	2360420	Well, yeah.
2360420	2362420	Kate said, can you do me a favor?
2362420	2366420	If I'm getting a wax, can you, you know, take care of...
2367420	2370420	But I want to be clear on this and let me know when I'm invading your privacy.
2370420	2371420	Oh, yeah.
2371420	2372420	Please.
2372420	2373420	Thank you, Dan.
2373420	2374420	I appreciate that.
2374420	2378920	But like this specifically, this wasn't a matter of we've been married this long and together
2378920	2386420	this long and I'd like to now make this new request just based on like all time, you know,
2386420	2387420	why not?
2387420	2388420	Let's make a change.
2388420	2393420	This was really specifically like, there's a new problem and here's a new solution.
2393420	2395420	I don't know if it was a problem.
2396420	2397420	You know what I'm asking?
2397420	2400420	Like, I want to know about the timeline of like, I want to know what the plot point of
2400420	2401420	this monster house is.
2401420	2404420	Like, are we saying...
2404420	2409420	When did the kids run across Never Crackers Long?
2409420	2411420	I'm just saying, like, God damn it.
2411420	2416420	Was she like, okay, she's your wife and then you finish making love and then she was like,
2416420	2417420	ha, that was great.
2417420	2419420	And you're like, thanks, man.
2420420	2422420	I was in a little box.
2423420	2428420	And she's like, well, I'd love to hang out and chat about your fucking day, but I got
2428420	2434420	to go get some stuff and also I get it, Lego two is hard.
2435420	2441420	I'm going to go, oh, by the way, you know, one of the places I'm stopping by is Brazilian
2441420	2442420	Wax.
2442420	2444420	Here's the card.
2444420	2446420	You might want to think about it.
2446420	2451420	And then like, and you're like, wait, is this something that you've always wanted?
2451420	2456420	And she said, no, this is something that needs to be done as of three weeks ago.
2456420	2457420	No, I don't.
2457420	2461420	It wasn't something that was like retroactive.
2461420	2467420	Like she would, she didn't like say like, yeah, I've been waiting 12 years to tell you
2467420	2468420	this.
2468420	2473420	I think it's just, she just said, you know, and it wasn't like an immediate thing.
2473420	2474420	It wasn't.
2474420	2475420	It wasn't an embarrassing thing.
2475420	2480420	Do you think it's because that you have been more neglectful of that or because your body
2480420	2484420	has gone into overdrive and you're producing more shrubbery down there?
2484420	2487420	Maybe, maybe, maybe a bit of both.
2487420	2490420	Oh, well, if there's been previous, am I a bad person?
2490420	2492420	I've never done anything.
2492420	2493420	Yeah.
2493420	2494420	Yeah.
2494420	2495420	You're a bad person.
2495420	2498420	I'm a bad.
2498420	2501420	No, no, you're a saint.
2501420	2505420	You're a saint because you don't dream your pubes.
2505420	2506420	You do it?
2506420	2508420	That's how that matters.
2508420	2513420	Spencer's balls are so, so glossy you can see yourself in them.
2513420	2517420	His, his nuts are like the top of the Chrysler building.
2517420	2520420	I shaved my balls once when I was like 32.
2520420	2521420	Oh, that's painful.
2521420	2523420	No, it was, it was all right.
2523420	2525420	Oh, maybe I'm bad at it.
2525420	2526420	Yeah.
2526420	2527420	It was like a week later.
2527420	2528420	That's when it sucked.
2528420	2529420	Yeah.
2529420	2530420	No.
2530420	2531420	Yeah.
2531420	2532420	That's what I mean.
2532420	2533420	It starts growing in.
2533420	2534420	Yeah.
2534420	2535420	Yeah.
2535420	2536420	No, it's painful.
2536420	2537420	So Spencer, I mean, you're, you have like a giant long head of hair.
2537420	2538420	No balls.
2538420	2539420	Yeah.
2539420	2544420	But is it braided?
2544420	2547420	No, it's too coarse.
2547420	2551420	Oh, don't sell your pubes short.
2551420	2553420	I texted my girlfriend.
2553420	2555420	Do you want me to trim my pubic hair?
2555420	2556420	Don't just do it.
2556420	2557420	Just do it.
2557420	2565420	I was just asking because I just found out Spencer does.
2566420	2569420	And he only fucks invertebrates.
2569420	2570420	Wait, what?
2570420	2571420	Yeah.
2571420	2572420	Yeah.
2572420	2573420	Slugs.
2573420	2574420	Those are invertebrates, right?
2574420	2575420	Mollux.
2575420	2576420	Mollux.
2576420	2577420	Mollux.
2577420	2579420	You fuck a gastropod once in a while.
2579420	2580420	Yeah.
2580420	2581420	A Nautilus.
2581420	2582420	You fucking Nautilus.
2582420	2583420	Yeah.
2583420	2584420	Well, my dick goes like a corkscrew.
2584420	2585420	Perfect.
2585420	2586420	Yeah.
2586420	2587420	Oh.
2587420	2588420	Oh.
2588420	2589420	Well, no, that was them.
2589420	2591420	That was like a roller coaster.
2591420	2594420	They were riding down his dick in their minds.
2595420	2598420	The Spencer dick.
2598420	2602420	300 miles per hour break-neck corkscrew speeds.
2602420	2606420	Oh, death-defying spirals and loop-de-loops.
2606420	2610420	You won't believe the vast efferettes of the Abadookamas.
2612420	2613420	Fuck.
2613420	2614420	No response?
2614420	2615420	All right.
2615420	2620420	So, Shrav, in response to your wife's suggestion, did you get to work?
2620420	2621420	Oh.
2621420	2622420	Yeah.
2622420	2623420	I cut my balls with the scissors.
2623420	2624420	Okay.
2624420	2625420	Oh.
2625420	2627420	I got too much to work.
2627420	2631420	I forgot with the lead-off of that story.
2631420	2633420	So, you stabbed yourself with scissors?
2633420	2634420	No.
2634420	2635420	It wasn't a stabbing.
2635420	2636420	Oh.
2636420	2637420	You got too close?
2637420	2639420	I was like, you know, you go dit-dit-dit.
2639420	2640420	Oh, boy.
2640420	2641420	And then you get a little bit.
2641420	2642420	Oh, shit.
2642420	2643420	I got to get going.
2643420	2644420	Dit-dit-dit.
2644420	2645420	Aye, aye.
2645420	2646420	Aye.
2646420	2650420	I mean, you stop enough until, I mean, like, but...
2650420	2652420	Yeah, it's just like a pinch.
2652420	2655420	It's a pinch, but there was blood involved.
2655420	2656420	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2656420	2657420	Oh, there's blood.
2657420	2658420	Oh, there was.
2658420	2659420	There will be blood.
2659420	2660420	Yeah.
2662420	2663420	And then you do a stupid thing.
2663420	2665420	Well, I won't do that again.
2665420	2666420	Dit-dit.
2666420	2667420	Ah, fuck me.
2668420	2670420	And then I just put the scissors down.
2671420	2674420	I have a team of young Korean boys that come over while I'm sleeping.
2675420	2678420	I would love their email addresses.
2679420	2681420	It's expensive, but it's worth it.
2681420	2682420	Please.
2682420	2684420	Is this why my wife left me?
2685420	2688420	No, it's because she went away for eight weeks and you didn't wash your butthole.
2688420	2689420	No.
2690420	2691420	I remember.
2693420	2697420	Yeah, you're not going to wash your butthole, but you're...
2697420	2699420	I better shave my pubes.
2699420	2702420	I do wash my butthole.
2704420	2705420	When's the last time?
2705420	2706420	Be honest.
2707420	2708420	When was the last time?
2708420	2709420	Be honest.
2709420	2711420	Sunday.
2711420	2712420	That's today.
2712420	2713420	Oh, wait. No, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2713420	2714420	Oh, a week ago?
2714420	2717420	I thought today was Tuesday when I said that, so do the math.
2717420	2718420	It's Tarmintown.
2718420	2719420	I know.
2720420	2723420	How many times do you do it here on a Tuesday?
2724420	2725420	Friday.
2725420	2726420	Friday, I wash my butthole.
2726420	2727420	Friday, you wash your butthole.
2727420	2728420	Nice.
2728420	2729420	Thoroughly.
2729420	2730420	Thoroughly.
2730420	2731420	That's all it takes?
2731420	2733420	Yeah, and you didn't shit for two days, probably, right?
2733420	2735420	I see where you're going with this.
2735420	2736420	I'm telling you, Dad.
2736420	2738420	I also didn't make love for Tuesday.
2738420	2743420	You can wash, you can bleach, you can just get it as clean as possible.
2743420	2744420	You can really get in there.
2744420	2745420	Thank you.
2745420	2747420	It's really antibacterial.
2747420	2751420	But if you're shit right afterwards, it's going to be dirty still.
2751420	2752420	It's not going to be clean.
2752420	2753420	Don't indoctrinate...
2753420	2754420	Dr. Mates.
2755420	2756420	I am your...
2756420	2757420	I'm...
2757420	2758420	Dr. Mates.
2759420	2760420	Welcome to my office.
2760420	2766420	Don't indoctrinate me into your Howard Hughes fucking shit that ended with you scalding your asshole with hot water.
2767420	2770420	I am the other side of the prism here.
2770420	2771420	Yes.
2771420	2772420	I didn't.
2772420	2773420	I didn't.
2773420	2775420	You can go too far, obviously.
2775420	2784420	On Friday, I took a shower, and yes, Saturday and Sunday have been seven in the morning call times till raps and then...
2784420	2785420	Oh my God.
2785420	2786420	Oh my God.
2787420	2791420	Here, this time, I'm the villain.
2791420	2795420	You're actually too busy to wash your own asshole.
2795420	2796420	Has she replied?
2796420	2798420	My girlfriend's response was, why don't we...
2798420	2800420	We should bring Andrew Weinberg out here.
2800420	2801420	He's our guest.
2801420	2803420	Read the text.
2803420	2805420	Let's get her responses.
2805420	2808420	Oh, because you guys won't have any responses to this.
2808420	2809420	He'll be...
2809420	2812420	Andrew will be back there for 20 more minutes if I read this first.
2812420	2813420	We'll bring him out first.
2813420	2818420	He's a co-creator of Eagle Heart, one of my favorite shows on Adult Swim.
2818420	2821420	It's one of my favorite shows, period, and it's on Adult Swim.
2821420	2827420	Sorry.
2827420	2830420	He's also the...
2830420	2832420	He's the beating heart.
2832420	2836420	He's the Chris McKenna of this History Channel thing I'm doing, the great minds.
2836420	2838420	Andrew Weinberg.
2846420	2848420	Hello, Andrew.
2848420	2849420	Hello.
2850420	2852420	I just wanted to get you out here before...
2852420	2854420	Andrew, you come at a rather propitious time.
2854420	2855420	Right, right, right.
2855420	2856420	I don't know if you've been listening to us.
2856420	2858420	I've heard of maintenance.
2858420	2859420	Yes.
2859420	2860420	His maintenance.
2860420	2862420	Yes, but damned dodging right now.
2862420	2864420	Come on, read what he said.
2864420	2868420	Her response was, ha, Spencer, I love it.
2869420	2871420	Whoa.
2872420	2874420	Does Steve Levy?
2875420	2877420	Whoa.
2878420	2879420	Steve?
2879420	2880420	Steve Levy.
2880420	2882420	Get out here and answer that question.
2886420	2887420	All right.
2887420	2889420	The show is for the ladies.
2891420	2895420	We might need a spin-off podcast about this.
2896420	2898420	Mount Hushmore.
2898420	2899420	What?
2899420	2901420	Secrets from men.
2902420	2903420	What's she asking?
2903420	2905420	Well, let me finish her test.
2905420	2908420	She asked me the most inappropriate questions.
2908420	2909420	Whoa.
2909420	2910420	That's good.
2910420	2911420	But you love it.
2911420	2912420	I mean, she coaches you.
2912420	2913420	What are you doing later?
2913420	2914420	Ha.
2915420	2916420	She said, ha.
2916420	2917420	Not like that.
2917420	2920420	Spencer, I'm assuming she's okay with me reading this.
2920420	2921420	Ha.
2921420	2922420	Spencer, I love it.
2922420	2923420	Does Steve Levy?
2923420	2925420	Jeff for sure does.
2927420	2932420	I think that's an educated guess, not research.
2932420	2934420	Mine's like a zen garden.
2934420	2936420	It's like a...
2936420	2938420	There's waves and little different.
2938420	2939420	Nah.
2939420	2942420	You don't need to for me, Bean.
2942420	2943420	Bean?
2945420	2947420	It's never been an issue.
2947420	2949420	I mean, I would be fine either way.
2949420	2950420	That means I'm supposed to.
2950420	2951420	That means I'm supposed to.
2951420	2952420	That's why you don't ask.
2952420	2954420	Yes, do it.
2954420	2955420	We have an answer.
2955420	2956420	All right.
2956420	2958420	I laser my...
2958420	2959420	Let's see.
2960420	2963420	Every six weeks, I don't fuck around, son.
2964420	2966420	She's saying laser your fucking...
2966420	2968420	She's saying I'm carrying my weight.
2968420	2969420	You know what?
2969420	2970420	I got caught tonight.
2970420	2972420	I thought this was like a new thing
2972420	2974420	and that if you were off the market, then you didn't...
2974420	2976420	You know, I'm like Archie Bunker.
2978420	2980420	I don't like Bill Maher that much.
2980420	2981420	Does Steve...
2981420	2982420	Do you?
2982420	2983420	Steve?
2983420	2984420	Oh, yeah.
2984420	2985420	Steve?
2985420	2988420	Actually, my answer is sort of unfortunate.
2988420	2989420	Uh-oh.
2989420	2990420	Yeah.
2990420	2991420	I have to.
2991420	2993420	I have to shave completely.
2993420	2994420	Or what?
2994420	2997420	Because I have an autoimmune skin disorder
2997420	3001420	and it's really fucking bad down there.
3001420	3004420	So in order to apply the fucking medication,
3004420	3005420	you gotta...
3005420	3006420	You gotta be smooth.
3006420	3007420	You gotta be smooth.
3008420	3009420	You gotta be smooth.
3009420	3012420	What are the bravest things that's ever been said on this stage?
3014420	3016420	You said it's really fucking bad down there.
3017420	3018420	Yeah.
3018420	3019420	It's a mess.
3019420	3020420	It sucks.
3020420	3021420	All right.
3021420	3024420	Those fucking... those pills that knock me out every week.
3024420	3025420	I don't...
3025420	3027420	I thought I was giving those to you.
3027420	3029420	Yeah, yeah.
3030420	3033420	So I think we have the full rainbow up here.
3033420	3034420	All right.
3034420	3035420	Well, we haven't heard from Weinberg.
3035420	3037420	And by the way, you don't have to participate.
3037420	3038420	Yes, you fucking do.
3038420	3039420	Yes, you do.
3039420	3043420	I'm honestly not sure precisely which area we're talking about.
3043420	3044420	The balls.
3044420	3045420	The balls.
3045420	3046420	The balls.
3046420	3047420	Oh, you mean the area...
3047420	3048420	Yeah.
3048420	3049420	What other...
3049420	3052420	Well, I can't answer that because I haven't gone down there...
3052420	3055420	Do you do some little pubic, you know, gardening?
3055420	3056420	No, I don't.
3056420	3057420	You don't.
3057420	3058420	You don't trim.
3058420	3059420	Not at all.
3059420	3060420	No.
3060420	3061420	Well, then why did it matter what area?
3062420	3063420	I guess...
3064420	3066420	I guess the answer to either would have been no.
3066420	3071420	But I didn't know if you meant, like, butthole maintenance or...
3072420	3073420	Because that was...
3073420	3075420	At one point, someone was talking about that.
3075420	3076420	Definitely him.
3077420	3082420	Rob, Rob, Rob, I don't want to put words in his mouth, but Rob...
3082420	3089420	Rob, I think it was in his 30s, started realizing that...
3090420	3091420	You knew where this was going.
3091420	3092420	I have no idea.
3093420	3097420	You started realizing that you had an awakening...
3097420	3098420	Oh, okay.
3098420	3100420	Yeah, now where are you going?
3100420	3101420	Yeah.
3101420	3102420	To the front.
3102420	3103420	I think it was a little...
3103420	3105420	It had to be earlier than 30.
3105420	3109420	I just remember at a certain point you started becoming obsessed with how dirty your asshole was.
3109420	3110420	Yes.
3110420	3111420	No, no, no.
3111420	3114420	That was before we loved Milwaukee, so it was like 26.
3114420	3116420	24, 26, yeah.
3116420	3122420	It is crazy that people accept that much shit in them and on them.
3122420	3126420	If you, like, got feces on your arm and just took a piece of paper and were like,
3126420	3127420	Eh, fine.
3127420	3129420	I'm going about my day now.
3129420	3130420	Yeah.
3130420	3131420	Yeah.
3132420	3135420	I mean, wiping your ass is a private thing.
3135420	3145420	You don't see it in detail in movies or they don't show you a cartoon on Saturday morning or anything.
3145420	3149420	And your parents just don't want to deal with it, and it's just yours to find out.
3151420	3159420	Thank God I was in the improv comedy scene back in the 90s because I never would have found out.
3160420	3167420	I never would have found out if I wouldn't have been constantly showing my balls and ass a dick to my friends.
3168420	3174420	I would have never have known that you're supposed to clean it and it made so much sense.
3174420	3176420	Made so much sense.
3176420	3180420	There was a click that happened in my brain that happened.
3180420	3183420	And now, beautiful.
3183420	3189420	It's so good.
3189420	3192420	It's like...
3192420	3195420	Surgeons call up Rob.
3195420	3201420	I wouldn't call myself a foodie, but it's like the same thing.
3201420	3202420	You're a bootie.
3202420	3203420	I'm a bootie.
3203420	3204420	Yeah.
3204420	3205420	Yeah.
3205420	3206420	But then...
3206420	3207420	Very important to me.
3207420	3211420	At one point, Rob became Icarus and flew too close to the sun.
3211420	3212420	Yeah, for sure.
3212420	3216420	And the butthole stuff, because he said himself he scalded his anus.
3216420	3225420	And a quest for cleanliness that turns really into a higher level of...
3225420	3227420	What do you call it?
3227420	3229420	Septicity? Is that a word?
3229420	3230420	Well, no.
3230420	3237420	It's just like if grossness is your concern, nothing's grosser than breaching the...
3238420	3244420	Because the thing is, our elementary canal technically is outside our body that shaped the torus.
3244420	3247420	It's like a donut.
3247420	3250420	That's how multicellular organisms formed, and that's why then they turned into worms.
3250420	3255420	I know I've been through this on this podcast before, but it's like the reason why worms...
3255420	3262420	That's the earliest kind of multicellular thing, and it's like what's happening is it's like a donut that's extruded.
3262420	3266420	That's still outside the body, stuff that goes in our mouth and eventually comes out our butt.
3266420	3271420	All it is is rubbing up against the outside of a collective of cells.
3271420	3273420	The way that cells eat, they rub up against a thing.
3273420	3280420	And so when you eat a donut, you're just sending it into the part of your body that you rub up against the outside world.
3280420	3282420	So that's why it's really dangerous when you...
3282420	3289420	I was just imagining myself in a highway rest stop for the last three seconds.
3289420	3292420	You mean like a guy walking by and listening to my podcast?
3293420	3296420	Just while you were going in that, I was like, he lost me.
3296420	3298420	I'm going to pull over.
3298420	3302420	But I say that's why it's really dangerous, like septic shock and stuff.
3302420	3305420	It's like when there's perforated, you know, Crohn's disease.
3305420	3310420	Anything that involves that barrier between what's going on in that canal and what's going on inside your body,
3310420	3311420	where there's blood cells.
3311420	3313420	If you get poop in your blood...
3313420	3318420	So I'm saying, this guy burnt his butt so much, you know, that's grosser than having poop in your butt.
3318420	3321420	I don't want to talk about it anymore.
3321420	3323420	Oh, Bean.
3323420	3325420	What do...
3325420	3327420	We've got a lot of dudes up here.
3327420	3329420	What do the women think?
3329420	3331420	Let's buy applause.
3331420	3333420	A little bit of trimming? What do you think?
3333420	3334420	Anybody?
3334420	3335420	Buy applause?
3335420	3338420	Are you asking the women here if guys should do that?
3338420	3340420	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3340420	3341420	Appreciate some trimming.
3341420	3342420	Yeah.
3342420	3343420	How about the whole thing?
3343420	3346420	You know, like a 12-year-old.
3346420	3348420	Huh? Something like that.
3348420	3357420	I was saying earlier, like, I don't really like Bill Maher that much, but there was one thing that I'm sure one of his funnier writers wrote, like, about...
3357420	3358420	Shots fired.
3358420	3362420	Finding a... Bill Maher's a cunt.
3362420	3365420	Shots landed.
3365420	3367420	War over.
3367420	3371420	No, I just like him, but...
3371420	3375420	That was clarification.
3375420	3378420	Dan, you're a cunt, but I love you.
3378420	3386420	He said, like, new rules or whatever, like, do we find a fine line between completely, like, shaven and not at all?
3386420	3393420	Like, there has to be some sort of sweet spot between, like, prepubescent and Dr. Livingston, I presume?
3393420	3398420	Which is a reference for people that are old.
3398420	3403420	Yeah, I... Okay, well, what do I do? Do I take a scissors?
3403420	3409420	Yeah, you just take a scissors, you pull the ball hair, and then you cut it.
3409420	3411420	Why do you have to pull it?
3411420	3414420	Because it separates it from the scrotum. You don't want to get up in there.
3414420	3415420	Yeah.
3415420	3418420	Also, you need curls and stuff. It's not going to lie flat.
3418420	3422420	Dan, don't fall the way of the shrub. Put your glasses on before you do that.
3422420	3427420	I'm your future, man. You don't want to do that.
3428420	3434420	That is a... You don't want to do that. Don't do it.
3434420	3442420	No, I'm woke now, because I realize, you know, like, you know, I don't know.
3442420	3445420	I guess I was not thinking about it. I wasn't really thinking about it objectively.
3445420	3446420	No, no, no.
3446420	3451420	And I am the beneficiary of people thinking about that stuff for themselves.
3451420	3455420	Do you have opinions about how much women's pubic hair should be? Do you, like, less?
3455420	3457420	Well, it's one of those things. See, that's the thing.
3457420	3461420	That's, like, this is where, you know, like, that's just, like, male...
3461420	3464420	This is a patriarchy in action. Like, we don't have to think about it.
3464420	3469420	Like, that's part of the crime. Like, don't get me started.
3469420	3471420	You know, I don't want to own up to that.
3471420	3477420	Like, you don't have to, like, the society in which a guy would have to, like, request it.
3477420	3480420	That's, like, that's the, you know...
3480420	3484420	Oh, that would be, yeah, that would be closer to equality than kind of, like...
3484420	3485420	I've never had to ask.
3485420	3490420	I would say, if I were your girlfriend, I would say, start washing your butt more, then we'll get to the pubes.
3490420	3502420	I wash it. I wash it. I've never, I've never, I've never been intimate with a companion without fully cleaning my areas,
3502420	3510420	except in occasions of, you know, rapturous silliness, perhaps, you know...
3510420	3513420	Just wash your butt.
3514420	3515420	Yeah, man.
3515420	3516420	Wash your butt.
3516420	3517420	I fucking do, bros.
3517420	3518420	Wash your butt.
3518420	3521420	You didn't do it. You didn't do it since Friday.
3521420	3523420	Get, dude, I've been busy.
3523420	3524420	Get a bidet, man.
3524420	3525420	7 a.m. course.
3525420	3527420	Spencer and I, we're going to get you a bidet.
3527420	3529420	I got one.
3529420	3531420	I got one. I fucking love it.
3531420	3533420	A separate, an actual separate...
3533420	3534420	No, no, no. I got, like, the most...
3534420	3535420	One of the Toto toilets.
3535420	3537420	...brondal, brondal swash, you know?
3537420	3538420	That's what I...
3538420	3540420	You just hook it up, and then you just press the button, and everything...
3540420	3541420	Swashes your brundle.
3542420	3543420	Yeah.
3543420	3544420	It's like...
3544420	3545420	Or your money back.
3546420	3549420	It's like how George Jetson takes his shit.
3551420	3552420	Just press the button.
3552420	3555420	I'm going to get one that has a fan, and it'll dry it off.
3555420	3557420	I'm going to save paper.
3559420	3560420	I was in a...
3560420	3564420	Joel McHale had a hotel room in Las Vegas once, and I tried it, and...
3564420	3566420	How did you find this out?
3566420	3567420	What do you mean?
3571420	3572420	He was doing... Is that a...
3572420	3573420	He's shrobbing you.
3575420	3576420	I wasn't.
3576420	3577420	I tried the bidet.
3577420	3579420	It burnt my butt.
3580420	3582420	How hot was it? Did you set it in?
3582420	3584420	I don't know. I didn't know you could set it at a temperature.
3584420	3585420	It's like, is this a whole different...
3585420	3587420	Well, you could get one that you could set the temperature.
3587420	3589420	Mine has three settings.
3592420	3595420	Speaking of George Jetson, you should get, like, a little...
3595420	3599420	You should get that Judy Jetson thing for your pews, where you get, like, different hairstyles.
3599420	3600420	I know.
3601420	3602420	Elvis Pompadour.
3602420	3605420	Wait, we're getting distant from the three settings.
3605420	3606420	I want to...
3607420	3612420	The three settings are warm, hot, and Mivita Loca.
3615420	3618420	You know, it's like ordering Thai food, you know?
3620420	3622420	You know, it's like...
3622420	3624420	Mild, windy, spicy...
3624420	3625420	Yes.
3626420	3632420	Thank you for writing the scripts and climbing aboard Great Minds.
3632420	3636420	I'm so busy, and I don't know if anybody out there has been watching it.
3639420	3640420	Thank you.
3640420	3643420	And thank you for being here on a very special all-poop episode.
3643420	3644420	Oh.
3644420	3645420	Or no poop.
3645420	3646420	No poop.
3646420	3648420	Ooh, poop's so bad.
3649420	3650420	Yeah, it's poop.
3651420	3652420	It's poop.
3652420	3654420	Yeah, it's trying to get out of your body.
3655420	3657420	Because it's healthy.
3658420	3664420	If you'd been listening to my biological explanation, you'd understand that it's a donut that's been turned into poop by you rubbing against it like a cat.
3666420	3668420	No, I wasn't listening.
3669420	3670420	I wasn't.
3670420	3672420	We are poop, by the way.
3673420	3674420	We're the poop of stars.
3674420	3675420	You're...
3677420	3682420	Don't subvert Carl Sagan's beautiful sentiments to your own weird poopy agenda.
3682420	3684420	I will, sir.
3684420	3685420	When I please.
3688420	3691420	Yeah, the donut shape, the toros?
3691420	3692420	Yeah.
3693420	3694420	Is that what you...
3694420	3695420	Oh, yeah, yeah.
3695420	3696420	Oh, you're getting me back on track.
3696420	3697420	Yes.
3698420	3700420	Here's the thing, Weinberg.
3700420	3702420	Thank you for creating Eagle Heart.
3702420	3703420	Love it very much.
3704420	3705420	No.
3705420	3706420	No.
3707420	3709420	You can't do that now.
3710420	3711420	Is it gone now?
3711420	3712420	Oh, yeah.
3712420	3713420	Long gone.
3714420	3715420	You had your chance.
3717420	3724420	I was willing to take a significant financial hit to prove a point to you for not watching.
3725420	3733420	I bothered because I was like, okay, well, I don't know that much about you, except that you're a lifesaver on that show, because, you know, like, like, it needed like a...
3733420	3735420	It needed somebody to be there.
3735420	3736420	Yes.
3736420	3737420	To what's that?
3737420	3738420	Someone to be there.
3738420	3739420	Yes.
3739420	3740420	Yes, be there, period.
3740420	3741420	Yes.
3742420	3744420	And so I was like, I'm going to Wikipedia him.
3744420	3746420	I don't want to accidentally trigger him or anything.
3746420	3748420	Like, maybe he's a Quaker or...
3750420	3752420	Do you believe I'm not a Quaker?
3753420	3755420	I'm actually Jewish.
3755420	3756420	You ever looked at your Wikipedia?
3756420	3758420	Weinberg sounds like a Quaker name.
3758420	3759420	Yeah.
3760420	3762420	I don't know who makes...
3762420	3764420	I honestly did not make it, so...
3764420	3769420	Your Wikipedia entry says, no, no, I don't think anybody would suspect you of making your own these days.
3770420	3776420	But, you know, you worked on Conan, you know, at both places.
3776420	3782420	You crossed the Conan threshold with him to L.A., did Eagle Heart, and then...
3783420	3787420	So then this is an extra section of your Wikipedia.
3787420	3791420	There's a heading I've never even seen that just says, association.
3791420	3793420	And I'm like, association?
3793420	3795420	What is it going to say?
3795420	3802420	He's like, oh, he's been seen with Tommy Hilfiger in the post-Nazi era of Germany.
3802420	3807420	It says, Weinberg joined the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity at Cornell University,
3807420	3811420	and through that organization, the Irving Literary Society.
3811420	3813420	What does that mean? It's so ominous.
3813420	3819420	Well, I don't know what the Irving Literary Society is, but probably someone from...
3819420	3821420	Apparently Wikipedia experts.
3821420	3825420	Well then, but that makes me think someone from the fraternity made this.
3825420	3827420	You went to Cornell?
3827420	3829420	Yes. That's where Carl Sagan went.
3829420	3831420	Yes, and Steve's dead.
3831420	3832420	That's true.
3832420	3833420	We had the same major.
3833420	3835420	Which was what?
3835420	3837420	Industrial and labor relations.
3837420	3838420	ILR school.
3838420	3840420	Yeah, which is dead like...
3843420	3845420	What were his pubes like?
3846420	3854420	My therapist told me in my last session that she's worried about Steve Levy.
3855420	3856420	She should be.
3856420	3858420	She's never spoken to him.
3858420	3859420	I've never had a conversation with him.
3859420	3863420	She based it on a voicemail, or a succession of voicemails.
3863420	3864420	It's like, is he okay?
3864420	3865420	I only left her one.
3865420	3869420	He sounds tired. Are you working? Are you guys busy?
3869420	3870420	Yeah, I guess.
3870420	3872420	She made me think that I'm killing Steve.
3872420	3875420	That's not important, but...
3875420	3876420	It's pretty important.
3876420	3877420	Steve?
3877420	3878420	It's very important.
3878420	3879420	Steve?
3879420	3880420	Yeah.
3880420	3881420	Is Dan killing you?
3881420	3882420	No. I mean, we're just working real hard.
3882420	3883420	That's how you die.
3883420	3887420	It's all based on what you tell her.
3887420	3890420	He's not also giving his side of the story.
3890420	3893420	No, but she was seriously just going like,
3893420	3897420	oh boy, he sounds like he's worn down.
3897420	3901420	I mean, I wasn't like, oh, I don't go in there and tell stories
3901420	3904420	about how hard it is to make Steve Levy miserable,
3904420	3906420	so I need therapy.
3906420	3909420	You don't make me miserable.
3909420	3912420	Well, we work...
3912420	3913420	Please don't kill me.
3913420	3916420	We're working seven days a week.
3916420	3917420	Seven days.
3917420	3919420	It'll be over soon, buddy, I promise.
3919420	3920420	No, it won't be over Steve.
3920420	3921420	It'll be over in months.
3921420	3922420	This is the rest of your life.
3922420	3923420	Yeah, it's good.
3923420	3924420	It's the rest of your life.
3924420	3925420	No, I'm going to be working for him soon.
3926420	3928420	It's not just me, Spencer, too.
3928420	3929420	We're working real hard.
3929420	3930420	Yeah, we're working real hard.
3930420	3934420	We're working team Harmon.
3934420	3938420	All right, Steve, as an example of your sacrifice,
3938420	3940420	because I do feel it's such a sausage party up here,
3940420	3942420	and obviously what we need to talk about is the pubic hair
3942420	3945420	and the buttholes and the balls.
3945420	3946420	We have to.
3946420	3952420	We need a woman up here, or someone that presents as such.
3952420	3954420	Cha-ching.
3955420	3957420	And there's only so many chairs and microphones.
3957420	3958420	I get it.
3958420	3960420	So could you go and pull the car around
3960420	3965420	and give it just a light buff, not a waxing.
3965420	3966420	You don't have to get waxed.
3966420	3967420	It's 9-11.
3967420	3971420	And then warm it up five minutes before I come out.
3971420	3973420	You know I would if you had a car.
3977420	3979420	It's 9-11!
3979420	3980420	All right.
3980420	3981420	All right.
3981420	3982420	Steve Levy, everybody.
3982420	3983420	Steve Levy.
3988420	3992420	Steve, our thoughts and prayers go to your weird pubic situation.
3995420	4000420	His GoFundMe is GoFundMe at Steve's Pubes.
4000420	4001420	Right?
4001420	4002420	Yes.
4002420	4006420	He left it very cryptic, a lot to wonder about.
4006420	4008420	Yeah, well, that's part of his allure.
4008420	4010420	Yeah.
4010420	4013420	You think I'm a good person, Andrew?
4013420	4014420	No.
4014420	4015420	No.
4015420	4016420	Oh, you were talking to him.
4016420	4020420	I'm trying to get fresh eyes on something that I know you guys already have.
4020420	4021420	Right, right, right.
4021420	4022420	Yeah, we do.
4022420	4027420	You've been working with me for a couple episodes of this tin pan thing.
4027420	4032420	I just feel like if I say yes, you're going to say, see?
4032420	4034420	I've been kind of mean to you a couple times.
4034420	4035420	No.
4035420	4036420	Well, yeah, but...
4036420	4039420	Get used to it!
4039420	4040420	Get used to it!
4040420	4041420	Get used to it!
4041420	4043420	Get used to it!
4043420	4044420	Get used to it!
4044420	4044420	
4044420	4045420	Get used to it!
4045420	4046420	Get used to it!
4046420	4047420	It gets worse!
4047420	4048420	It gets worse!
4048420	4050420	It gets worse!
4050420	4053420	The closer you get, it gets worse!
4053420	4061420	The closer you are to him, the more you reach out, the more he'll hit you and spark it out!
4061420	4063420	It gets worse!
4063420	4064420	Get worse!
4064420	4065420	Get worse!
4065420	4066420	Get worse!
4067420	4069420	Have an exit plan.
4071420	4075420	Have enough in the bank that you can leave and walk out at any time.
4075420	4076420	Just have an exit plan.
4076420	4077420	It gets worse.
4077420	4078420	It gets worse.
4078420	4079420	It gets worse.
4079420	4080420	It gets worse!
4080420	4081420	It gets worse!
4081420	4082420	It gets worse!
4085420	4090420	Not only do I need, I demand somebody put that to a beat and some music.
4090420	4095420	I want that to be my ringtone, my alarm clock, everywhere.
4095420	4099420	I don't know that it could be put to a beat.
4099420	4100420	That's why you need me.
4100420	4102420	I always provided the rhythm.
4102420	4108420	He was the lyrics and I was the beat.
4108420	4111420	You are the sun and the moon.
4111420	4113420	What were you going to say?
4113420	4118420	Here's the thing, to get specific, I'm acting in this show.
4118420	4121420	There has to be a script when I show up.
4122420	4123420	There's jokes.
4123420	4127420	If I don't know how to do the thing, I'll do this thing where I'm like,
4127420	4130420	I caught myself, I realized what I was doing.
4130420	4135420	Where I go, I don't know how to deliver this line because I'm not really an actor.
4135420	4136420	Then I get nervous.
4136420	4138420	I go, I don't know how to do this.
4138420	4140420	I'm doing this wrong and I can't remember it.
4140420	4144420	Then I go, it must be poorly written, the line.
4144420	4147420	Then I'm questioning the line.
4147420	4149420	Can we beat this?
4150420	4153420	I've experienced worse.
4155420	4157420	He worked on Conan.
4159420	4162420	No, I'm not talking about Conan himself.
4162420	4164420	He seems really nice.
4164420	4165420	He is.
4165420	4167420	He's like a nice guy to work for.
4167420	4170420	You've experienced worse in terms of writer on writer cruelty.
4170420	4175420	Or like cruel overlord.
4176420	4179420	But that's not what I'm saying you are.
4183420	4189420	But yeah, from when I started knowing what I thought I knew about you,
4189420	4194420	I said, well, at some point he's going to explode at me over something
4194420	4198420	and it never happened week after week.
4198420	4202420	Then, yeah, one or two little things.
4203420	4210420	I wish this thing about exploding, this idea of exploding,
4210420	4212420	it makes me sound like some kind of ...
4212420	4215420	But that's not based on who you actually are.
4215420	4217420	That was what I was expecting to have.
4217420	4219420	No, I'm talking about the legend of me.
4219420	4223420	I'm fine with it circulating that I'm always hard to work for,
4223420	4225420	but I wish it's that one thing.
4225420	4229420	It's like that idea, because that sounds like such a pretentious thing
4229420	4233420	as a thing where you're throwing a water bottle or you're screaming about something.
4233420	4234420	I don't really do ...
4234420	4235420	No.
4235420	4236420	But I do something probably worse,
4236420	4243420	which is I start manic obsessing and saying rude things while I'm like ...
4243420	4246420	It's like because you have a ...
4246420	4258420	I'm sorry about him, by the way.
4258420	4260420	The thing is, it's like everybody goes like,
4260420	4262420	oh, bring Rob back.
4262420	4263420	The kids love Rob.
4263420	4267420	It hurts, but I bring him back for them.
4267420	4271420	He's doing worse things than I'm accused of doing.
4271420	4274420	I feel like Andrew is giving you the same response
4274420	4277420	that you got about should you shave your pubes.
4277420	4279420	He's being very diplomatic like Cody was.
4279420	4281420	He's saying like, I'd be fine if you ...
4281420	4282420	If you cooled it all over.
4282420	4285420	... trimmed your personality.
4285420	4288420	You don't have to, because I'm a professional.
4288420	4290420	I don't fuck around.
4290420	4291420	I laser my ...
4291420	4293420	I have been with people with more pubes than you,
4293420	4298420	but that person was a gorilla.
4298420	4300420	Anyway, is that what you ...
4300420	4303420	Yeah, so it was like kind of I was dropped into it,
4303420	4310420	and I was like, okay, now edit this into something Dan's going to love and go,
4310420	4315420	and then he's going to come in and have zero involvement for five days,
4315420	4321420	and then on the sixth day come in and judge it.
4321420	4323420	But then I stay until it's perfect.
4323420	4325420	Yeah, and it's been fine.
4325420	4328420	I'm sorry to disappoint your bloodthirsty audience.
4328420	4330420	No, no, I don't ...
4330420	4332420	It's been fine.
4332420	4334420	It's been just fine.
4334420	4335420	It's been fine.
4335420	4336420	It's been fine.
4336420	4338420	It's been okay.
4338420	4339420	It's fine.
4339420	4341420	No, that aspect has been fine.
4341420	4343420	Overall, it has been great.
4343420	4345420	The enjoyment was fine.
4345420	4346420	That's what I'm saying.
4346420	4349420	Went to see a movie and walked out.
4349420	4351420	It was fine.
4351420	4353420	Hey, how was that sex you had last night?
4353420	4355420	Did you enjoy it?
4355420	4357420	It was fine.
4357420	4358420	I was not ...
4358420	4361420	It's clear I was not talking about the overall experience.
4361420	4362420	No, I was.
4362420	4364420	Andrew.
4364420	4368420	Andrew, you said quite enough.
4368420	4370420	All right, I just want ...
4370420	4371420	Here's the thing.
4371420	4375420	He's currently texting how to fire Andrew.
4375420	4378420	I was at least pushed into wherever I ended up, right?
4378420	4380420	No, I love you for being as honest as you.
4380420	4382420	My right foot fell asleep.
4382420	4383420	Oh, jeez.
4383420	4386420	You got to shave that.
4386420	4388420	You got to shave those pants, bro.
4388420	4389420	Come on.
4389420	4390420	Come on, Bilbo.
4390420	4393420	Shave that foot.
4393420	4397420	You got to shave that foot, man.
4397420	4399420	Foot's got too much hair.
4399420	4402420	Choking that foot off.
4402420	4406420	Is there ... I feel like ...
4406420	4410420	I just want to get anybody from the other side,
4410420	4414420	because we are talking about a gender thing.
4414420	4418420	I just want to get a lady-type person up here.
4418420	4420420	What woman wouldn't want to come up
4420420	4423420	and share in the rich conversation
4423420	4426420	of butthole, cleanliness, and pubes?
4426420	4428420	It'll just be a check-in, just because I don't want to feel ...
4428420	4430420	I don't want to commit the crime of underrepresented ...
4430420	4433420	Does anybody want to come up and be representative?
4433420	4434420	We have a hand there.
4434420	4437420	A point of view that you're willing to share about the ...
4437420	4438420	Welcome.
4438420	4439420	... the specific things.
4439420	4441420	Welcome to the Thunderdome.
4441420	4442420	Come on up.
4443420	4444420	There you go.
4444420	4445420	Hello.
4445420	4446420	Hello.
4446420	4447420	What's your name again?
4447420	4448420	It's Kelly.
4448420	4449420	Kelly.
4449420	4450420	All right.
4450420	4451420	Thank you.
4451420	4452420	Thank you for your bravery.
4452420	4456420	We will not betray you or hurt you.
4456420	4458420	What if you really pushed the limits on that?
4458420	4460420	What if you said something and everyone was like,
4460420	4461420	ah, fuck.
4461420	4464420	She's a terrible person.
4464420	4468420	You're willing to share your thoughts about the ...
4468420	4469420	You need to shave.
4469420	4470420	Okay.
4470420	4474420	I mean, shave as opposed to trim with a scissors.
4474420	4475420	I would get a trim.
4475420	4477420	Oh, big as your scissors.
4477420	4480420	How big are your scissors?
4480420	4481420	This big.
4481420	4483420	I was talking to him.
4483420	4484420	He was doing this.
4484420	4487420	Kelly, when you say shave, do you mean get it all gone?
4487420	4488420	No.
4488420	4489420	Yeah, but just maintain.
4489420	4490420	Maintain.
4490420	4491420	Maintain the borders.
4491420	4492420	Trim.
4492420	4493420	Maintain borders.
4493420	4494420	Maintain borders.
4494420	4495420	No.
4495420	4496420	Repel borders, lads.
4497420	4501420	From the outside eyes then, so looking at the male,
4501420	4504420	like when the pants are coming off,
4504420	4506420	to give me some guidelines about ...
4506420	4508420	You know, like I saw a queer eye for the straight guy once
4508420	4510420	and they said the sideburns, like they had some rules
4510420	4513420	about where your ears are and your sideburns should be.
4513420	4515420	Do you have any rules about ...
4515420	4516420	If I'm going to go down ...
4516420	4520420	If your pubes are by your ears, man.
4520420	4521420	If I'm going to ...
4521420	4524420	How do I know when I'm finished?
4524420	4526420	Like what's my goal, you know?
4526420	4528420	Because I obsess about stuff.
4530420	4534420	Well, I would get your girlfriend involved and ask her
4534420	4538420	and do a little trimming and then go ...
4538420	4540420	What do you think about this?
4540420	4542420	And then she could go a little off the top.
4542420	4543420	Yeah.
4543420	4546420	Because it's really more for her comfort.
4546420	4547420	Right, okay.
4547420	4549420	So she'll be the judge of that, just like ...
4549420	4550420	Guys typically ...
4550420	4551420	Okay, but ...
4551420	4552420	Guys typically ...
4552420	4553420	Why do you have to guess?
4553420	4554420	Can't you just ask her what she wants?
4554420	4555420	No, of course I can.
4555420	4558420	You guys are presidents of the High Road Club, but ...
4558420	4560420	Now getting back, since we have you up here,
4560420	4561420	would you be willing to ...
4561420	4564420	I don't want to pry into you, but you knew why you're coming up.
4564420	4566420	Can you tell us about your personal taste,
4566420	4567420	so that just as a yard ...
4567420	4568420	Sure.
4570420	4572420	Why'd you think you were coming up here?
4572420	4574420	No.
4574420	4577420	I prefer it to be ...
4577420	4580420	The shaft needs to be clear and free.
4580420	4581420	Clear and ...
4581420	4582420	Okay.
4582420	4583420	Usually not a problem.
4583420	4584420	That's what got me into trouble.
4584420	4586420	That ...
4586420	4589420	Because I can see that, and I was like ...
4589420	4590420	Let me ...
4590420	4592420	Kelly, I just thought I'd slow you down,
4592420	4594420	because this is like ...
4594420	4597420	Every word is worth a thousand pictures here.
4599420	4602420	The shaft needs to be free and clear.
4602420	4604420	I could interpret that as a lot of different ...
4604420	4607420	No, she's saying get the hair off the shaft of your dick.
4607420	4611420	Even that, though, off of it, meaning at the base of it,
4611420	4615420	I don't have hair on the shaft of my dick.
4615420	4616420	Are we talking about ...
4616420	4617420	Well, then you're halfway home.
4617420	4618420	Yeah.
4618420	4619420	You're halfway home.
4619420	4620420	That's fine.
4620420	4622420	When you look at my dick, if I'm laying down
4622420	4627420	and you look down at me naked from a helicopter,
4627420	4632420	is there just a circle of baldness around ...
4632420	4637420	And then there's a friar haircut kind of thing
4637420	4640420	going in a circle around.
4640420	4643420	There's a blast radius of ...
4643420	4645420	The shaft needs to be free and clear.
4645420	4646420	Do you mean at the base,
4646420	4648420	or do you mean the encroaching on the ...
4648420	4650420	There shouldn't be hair on it, right?
4650420	4652420	There should be no hair on it.
4652420	4653420	Yeah.
4653420	4656420	And where her lips might touch.
4656420	4657420	Keep that clear.
4657420	4659420	Yeah, you don't want to get hair in your teeth.
4659420	4661420	It's gross.
4661420	4665420	I don't want somebody who is different from me
4665420	4668420	freaking out, but I didn't think these are places
4668420	4670420	where there could be hair.
4670420	4675420	I could see it touching and that affecting her.
4675420	4680420	Do you have a big 70s natural bush down there?
4680420	4683420	Do you have a big old thatch?
4683420	4686420	I don't know.
4686420	4688420	I mean, it is a carer.
4688420	4691420	It sounds like this mailer I get every year
4691420	4695420	from the fire department about brush clearance.
4698420	4701420	Kelly's gotten specific about two areas now.
4701420	4703420	She's just getting started.
4703420	4704420	She's working her way down.
4704420	4707420	I want to take it slow.
4707420	4709420	She's talking about that.
4709420	4710420	She's saying, clear the shaft.
4710420	4713420	Get any hairs off the shaft, right?
4713420	4715420	How would there be hairs on the ...
4715420	4717420	There's sometimes hairs on the shaft.
4717420	4719420	It's accepted.
4719420	4721420	Jesus Christ.
4721420	4723420	I know what you're talking about.
4723420	4726420	Dan, you probably have hairs on the base of the shaft
4726420	4727420	of your dick.
4727420	4728420	I'll take a look.
4728420	4730420	You might not.
4730420	4731420	Give it a look-see.
4731420	4733420	Everyone's different, Dan.
4733420	4735420	That might not be an issue for you.
4735420	4738420	You might have a clear and free shaft already.
4738420	4740420	Well, what if this is an ugly duckling story?
4740420	4744420	What if I have a beautiful perfect ...
4744420	4747420	What if it turns out all you guys have afros
4747420	4749420	on the tip of your dicks?
4749420	4751420	You've got to get that shit off of there.
4751420	4752420	I don't have that.
4752420	4755420	I have alopecia on my penis.
4755420	4756420	You guys are like, no.
4756420	4760420	My dick looks like a 70s sportscaster.
4760420	4764420	It's got a headset on the tip and a toupee.
4764420	4766420	See, no wonder you guys thought I was weird
4766420	4768420	for not doing anything.
4768420	4770420	Kelly, let's keep moving along.
4771420	4772420	Shaft free and clear.
4772420	4774420	Then next stage, what?
4774420	4778420	Again, her preference, because if she's doing stuff
4778420	4782420	with your balls, I would keep it trimmed down.
4782420	4785420	Keep it classy.
4785420	4788420	Have you named this imaginary third party
4788420	4792420	what she would like?
4792420	4797420	She's saying the customer is always right.
4797420	4798420	Exactly.
4798420	4800420	That goes without saying, and that's why ...
4800420	4802420	I'm trying to actually liberate, because I don't want her
4802420	4805420	to have to be an ambassador of anything.
4805420	4808420	I wanted to have representation up here,
4808420	4809420	but she shouldn't ...
4809420	4811420	What if somebody's going to tweet at her?
4811420	4813420	She's an individual.
4813420	4816420	I just wanted to hear what her preferences are,
4816420	4819420	because I know I'm going to go talk to my girlfriend
4819420	4821420	and I'll work it out with her, but I'm just curious
4821420	4825420	while we have you up here, what the terminology ...
4825420	4830420	Just mow the lawn, man.
4830420	4833420	If you had a lawn and you live in a nice neighborhood,
4833420	4836420	you would be like, shit, the grass is getting a little long.
4836420	4839420	I feel like you guys are mad at me for not knowing
4839420	4841420	how to trim my dick hair.
4841420	4843420	It's just a simple concept is all.
4843420	4844420	It's a simple concept.
4844420	4845420	Yes.
4845420	4848420	You make the hair shorter than it is.
4849420	4851420	I love you, Spencer.
4856420	4858420	With your glasses on.
4859420	4860420	Preferably with glasses on.
4860420	4861420	Yes.
4861420	4863420	Probably with the magnifying mirror, too.
4863420	4864420	Yes. It's helpful.
4864420	4865420	Be safe.
4865420	4868420	Kelly, do you get the full nine, like the Brazilian,
4868420	4870420	the whole wax thing?
4870420	4871420	No.
4871420	4873420	Have you ever tried it?
4873420	4874420	No.
4874420	4875420	Me?
4875420	4877420	That'd be amazing.
4877420	4879420	It was just like, I don't do shit.
4879420	4881420	Are you kidding me?
4882420	4885420	They would carry you out on their shoulders.
4885420	4887420	They'd be like, wow, I don't agree with her,
4887420	4889420	but that was amazing.
4889420	4892420	Kelly looks like Leo Sayer down there.
4892420	4893420	Oh, boy.
4893420	4895420	No one got that reference.
4895420	4898420	Google Leo Sayer and you'll be very happy about it.
4898420	4900420	Do women ...
4902420	4906420	To what extent is outside help fundamental
4906420	4908420	to this whole thing?
4908420	4910420	And to what extent ...
4910420	4912420	Do it yourself.
4912420	4915420	Would you guys stop pissing and whining at me?
4915420	4918420	It's such a ridiculous thing when someone is putting
4918420	4920420	themselves down this low.
4920420	4921420	I know.
4921420	4924420	You're saying, should you ask for outside assistance
4924420	4926420	or should you do it yourself?
4926420	4930420	No, I'm asking a question about curiosity
4930420	4932420	to the women's side of the fence because I've heard
4932420	4934420	the things about, oh, I'm going to get lasered,
4934420	4936420	I'm going to do these things, and I'm curious
4936420	4938420	about the amount of maintenance that we currently
4938420	4941420	consider to be fundamental or default,
4941420	4944420	whatever you would call it, kind of like a cultural
4944420	4945420	average or whatever.
4945420	4948420	How much of that involves third parties for women
4948420	4949420	and how much for men?
4949420	4951420	See what I'm sniffing out here?
4951420	4953420	When you're thinking about your maintenance,
4953420	4957420	it's never occurred to you to pay someone to do it.
4957420	4959420	You're thinking about things you do yourself.
4959420	4960420	Right.
4960420	4963420	But it's very possible that a woman goes somewhere
4963420	4967420	and pays someone to do that for her.
4967420	4969420	You're seeing what happens.
4969420	4970420	I think so.
4970420	4971420	Don't you think that's an interesting thing?
4971420	4973420	There's no indication of that from the audience.
4973420	4975420	Well, maybe they're leaning in.
4975420	4976420	They're like, wait a minute.
4976420	4977420	I don't know.
4977420	4979420	And who knows?
4979420	4981420	That might be like, oh, yeah, because that's
4981420	4983420	how we like it and we're in control.
4983420	4986420	But it's also like, do men go to places
4986420	4988420	and get it done like a lot?
4988420	4989420	There's some definitely.
4989420	4990420	You can.
4990420	4991420	You can.
4991420	4993420	Don't use Nair.
4993420	4994420	Yes, that is true.
4994420	4995420	Don't use Nair.
4995420	4996420	No.
4996420	4997420	That's not for no matter.
4997420	5000420	Is that, do you have a bad experience with Nair?
5000420	5002420	I did.
5002420	5003420	What happened?
5003420	5006420	It burned like a motherfucker.
5006420	5009420	Because Nair is like acid that goes down into your follicles
5009420	5011420	and like burns out the root, right?
5011420	5013420	Yeah, yeah.
5013420	5015420	And for some reason, your penis is more sensitive to acid
5015420	5017420	than your shoulders.
5017420	5018420	Where are you supposed to use it?
5018420	5020420	I've talked to women, some that I've dated
5020420	5022420	and some that I've just friends that we've talked about this
5022420	5023420	before.
5023420	5025420	And their feeling is like guys sometimes
5025420	5026420	demand.
5026420	5028420	They want the woman to be Brazilian waxed
5028420	5030420	like all the way across the board.
5030420	5032420	And I think it's fair for the woman to say,
5032420	5033420	then you fucking do it too.
5033420	5035420	Like you go in there and have somebody put some
5035420	5037420	hot ass wax on your balls
5037420	5040420	and have some stranger rip it off you.
5040420	5042420	And there's a chick I used to date.
5042420	5044420	She goes to a place.
5044420	5045420	I said, do guys go in and do it?
5045420	5046420	She goes, yeah.
5046420	5049420	But it has to be a referral.
5049420	5050420	Because you can't just go in like,
5050420	5053420	hey, I want you to do it.
5053420	5055420	You know, I'm just a regular person
5055420	5057420	coming in here, paying customer.
5057420	5059420	I think there's guys that love to go in there
5059420	5063420	and just like, it's like a cheap dominatrix basically.
5063420	5067420	And to them that's important, like the intent?
5067420	5069420	No, no, no.
5069420	5072420	There's a million ways to be turned on by weird things.
5072420	5073420	And they don't want...
5073420	5074420	No, no.
5074420	5075420	The woman that run these...
5075420	5076420	Oh, because he had an erection
5076420	5078420	and he'd be like a psychic.
5078420	5081420	We do this because we're doing a service.
5081420	5085420	You're just here to use this as a sex operation.
5085420	5087420	I mean, you could have that rule about anything.
5087420	5089420	It's like a gas station.
5089420	5092420	If you're one of these people that gets a hard on when you pump gas,
5092420	5095420	take it down the fucking road.
5095420	5098420	We'd like you to refill your car here and not come on us.
5098420	5102420	Yeah, but you don't make the guy at the 76 station look at your dick.
5102420	5105420	No, I'm agreeing with you and saying,
5105420	5107420	yeah, that's an understandable rule.
5107420	5111420	And all businesses, especially places that do go near your wiener.
5111420	5117420	Okay, well, Kelly, do you have any books to plug or anything?
5117420	5118420	No, I'm just...
5118420	5121420	This is actually the first day of our honeymoon.
5121420	5123420	Thanks.
5127420	5128420	What's your husband's name?
5128420	5129420	Trey.
5129420	5130420	Trey?
5130420	5132420	What are his pubes like?
5132420	5133420	Short.
5133420	5134420	Short?
5134420	5138420	Do you assist or does he take care of business on his own?
5138420	5139420	He does it himself.
5139420	5140420	Not a boy.
5140420	5141420	Not a boy.
5141420	5145420	Is it a delayed honeymoon or do you guys really just get married?
5145420	5146420	No, it's a delayed honeymoon.
5146420	5147420	When did you get married?
5147420	5148420	Three years ago.
5148420	5151420	But this is a sad reality.
5151420	5154420	I went to work the day after I was married.
5154420	5155420	We did.
5155420	5157420	It was like, yeah, well, honeymoon and Christmas,
5157420	5160420	and you guys had to wait three years.
5160420	5163420	We're going to Japan, so we had to save up.
5163420	5166420	So fuck you.
5166420	5170420	You guys came to L.A. as a waypoint, as a layover?
5170420	5171420	Yep.
5171420	5174420	We had here at 5.30 and this was our first time.
5174420	5175420	Whoa.
5175420	5180420	Did you plan that, to do layover and then fly out here?
5180420	5181420	Yeah.
5181420	5182420	Wow.
5182420	5183420	That's kudos to Skye.
5183420	5186420	I couldn't manage that kind of schedule.
5186420	5190420	Oh, yeah, we'll schedule and then we'll pop over to the show.
5190420	5191420	That's crazy.
5191420	5194420	That's the kind of crazy that makes someone's nether regions
5194420	5206420	totally sculpted and consumable by the public.
5206420	5210420	I'm just a savage, feral, shambling mound of...
5210420	5213420	Consumable?
5213420	5215420	I know you meant visually.
5215420	5219420	Yeah, no, I mean, you consume a season of Cows of Cards.
5219420	5220420	You don't eat it.
5220420	5225420	Probably an unfortunate way to refer to it.
5225420	5229420	I can't really win tonight, except in one sense,
5229420	5232420	which is that I was willing to occupy that position,
5232420	5234420	and in such...
5234420	5235420	Shut up.
5235420	5238420	Drunk, fat idiot.
5238420	5241420	Well, Kelly, thank you so much for being brave enough
5241420	5245420	to share your private life with us
5245420	5248420	and congratulations to your husband.
5248420	5250420	Thank you very much. Thank you.
5250420	5251420	I gotta go.
5251420	5252420	Oh, he's gotta go.
5252420	5253420	I gotta go.
5253420	5255420	Rob, where you gotta go, Rob?
5255420	5258420	I'm gonna go see Kate's show at the Pack Theater.
5258420	5260420	Oh, nice.
5260420	5262420	Let's all go.
5262420	5264420	All right.
5264420	5267420	I bet they would. I bet they'd follow you.
5267420	5268420	You've taken over my show.
5268420	5269420	I'm not taking over my show.
5269420	5271420	I wonder how many people would go if Rob just, like,
5271420	5274420	tried to pied-piper some of this crowd.
5274420	5277420	I can't do a pied-piper noise.
5277420	5279420	Uh, but, uh, hey, man.
5279420	5280420	Thank you, Rob Schraub.
5280420	5281420	Rob Schraub, everybody.
5281420	5282420	Whoo!
5282420	5283420	Whoo!
5283420	5284420	Whoo!
5284420	5285420	Whoo!
5285420	5290420	Oh, the friendship we forgot
5290420	5295420	The guess that we all loved
5295420	5298420	Is I've been shrubbin'
5298420	5301420	All the shrubbin'
5301420	5305420	And all bling shrub
5305420	5309420	It gets worse, it gets worse, it gets worse
5309420	5312420	Whoo!
5312420	5313420	Well...
5313420	5315420	Internet, you'll be lettin' me down
5315420	5316420	If you don't put that shit together.
5316420	5318420	I want mash-ups, I want music videos,
5318420	5319420	I want the whole thing.
5319420	5322420	Well, I bet you guys thought you saw me stumble
5322420	5323420	Into a strange sta-
5323420	5326420	God damn it.
5326420	5328420	Dan, we're gonna take it again.
5328420	5329420	We'll take it again.
5329420	5331420	Okay, guys, go to the silence.
5331420	5332420	Uh, applause on three.
5332420	5334420	One, two, three, applause.
5335420	5338420	Well, I bet you guys saw a-
5338420	5340420	Ha!
5340420	5343420	We'll take it again, we'll take it again.
5343420	5346420	Well, I bet you guys thought you saw me stumble
5346420	5350420	Into a weird sniper's nest of random conversation
5350420	5352420	About my pubic hair.
5352420	5354420	Which is also what we call your pubic hair,
5354420	5356420	A sniper's nest.
5357420	5360420	This is low-hanging fruit.
5360420	5363420	That's also what we call it.
5363420	5365420	He's getting old, ladies.
5365420	5367420	He's getting old.
5369420	5373420	But the truth is, I teed it all up
5373420	5375420	Because it's all been a part of my master plan
5375420	5376420	This whole thing?
5376420	5379420	Because I've got an ace up my sleeve, podcast-wise
5379420	5382420	An expert on pubic hair.
5382420	5384420	An ace up my sleeve, podcast-wise
5384420	5387420	An expert on pubic management.
5387420	5389420	Mr. Demorge Brown is here.
5398420	5400420	Yes, you are, sir.
5404420	5406420	Hello.
5406420	5408420	And how are you?
5408420	5410420	I know I keep sexually harassing you
5410420	5412420	Every time you come outside.
5412420	5414420	I walked in the crea-
5414420	5417420	He keeps hitting peak handsome.
5417420	5420420	I think we're roughly the same age.
5420420	5425420	You're hitting this sexy whaler thing.
5425420	5429420	Yeah, the high-rolled turtleneck and the patches.
5429420	5432420	You're like a hot, collegiate kind of thing going on.
5432420	5434420	Is it racist?
5434420	5436420	I want to take poli sci for me.
5436420	5439420	It's the Black Hemingway thing.
5439420	5442420	Black Hemingway!
5442420	5444420	Is there a Black Hemingway?
5444420	5446420	Who is the Black Hemingway?
5446420	5447420	It's just you.
5447420	5448420	Flavor Flav, I think.
5448420	5449420	Flavor Flav?
5449420	5451420	Black Whaler's spot.
5451420	5453420	Sorry.
5453420	5455420	If you want to take it.
5455420	5457420	Just go to the Florida Keys.
5457420	5459420	I'm sure you'll find somebody.
5459420	5462420	Some guy who made a fortune in publishing.
5462420	5466420	The Johnson Publishing Industry, Ebony Magazine.
5466420	5468420	And he's down in the Florida Keys right now
5468420	5469420	and he's just fishing.
5469420	5470420	Office millions.
5470420	5473420	Demarge, tell us about your pubic hair
5473420	5476420	and the policies about it you have.
5476420	5480420	And what you demand in others.
5480420	5483420	Or you can say pass and we'll just move on.
5483420	5485420	Well, since I'm wearing this sweater,
5485420	5491420	I suppose I have to be frank.
5491420	5493420	I take care of my business.
5493420	5496420	I manage it, yeah, of course, absolutely.
5496420	5497420	No outside help, though.
5497420	5498420	No clinics.
5498420	5499420	No, no, no, no.
5499420	5500420	No, no, no.
5500420	5501420	You manage it with?
5501420	5502420	Shears.
5502420	5503420	Shears.
5503420	5504420	Finger shears.
5504420	5505420	Small scissors.
5505420	5506420	You cut it with scissors.
5506420	5507420	Scissors.
5507420	5508420	And a razor.
5508420	5509420	But, you know, I'm a runner.
5509420	5511420	You call scissors shears, really, by default?
5511420	5512420	No, just fucking run.
5512420	5514420	Oh, okay.
5514420	5516420	Shears are shears.
5516420	5520420	They have their own purpose and avenue in life.
5520420	5523420	I am a runner and I run long distances
5523420	5525420	when I'm really in a swing.
5525420	5528420	And so I have to because of friction of it over time.
5528420	5530420	Like, over the course of two or three weeks,
5530420	5531420	it just consists of running.
5531420	5535420	It's just too much abrasion, friction, whatever.
5535420	5536420	That's it.
5536420	5537420	So I have to...
5537420	5538420	And it's...
5538420	5540420	You know, we've had breast cancer survivors up here,
5540420	5545420	but I'm really proud of us tonight.
5545420	5547420	I think we're very brave.
5547420	5551420	Because men, you need to check yourselves.
5552420	5555420	I'm afraid I keep asking questions and going,
5555420	5558420	just cut your pubic hair.
5558420	5560420	I feel like I'm being bullied a little bit,
5560420	5563420	but I'll put a pin in it.
5563420	5565420	Because I'm going to keep asking.
5565420	5568420	The very first thing Kelly said, I think, is the most...
5568420	5569420	Like, to the point.
5569420	5571420	She said, like, talk to the person that you're with.
5571420	5572420	Like, ask your...
5572420	5573420	Yeah, of course.
5573420	5574420	Yeah, fine.
5574420	5576420	No, I said, like, I can't...
5576420	5578420	What am I supposed to do?
5578420	5579420	I can't...
5579420	5580420	Or...
5580420	5582420	Do a will I am hologram of my girlfriend?
5582420	5583420	Yeah.
5583420	5584420	I can't...
5586420	5589420	Porta guard, conjure her up.
5590420	5592420	Wait, what was I going to ask?
5592420	5593420	Fuck, I was going to ask something.
5593420	5594420	God damn it.
5594420	5595420	Fuck, shit.
5595420	5596420	Shit.
5596420	5597420	Such a fuck up.
5597420	5598420	Or you just take the first step, man.
5598420	5600420	You were talking about how brave we were being
5600420	5602420	compared to women who survived cancer.
5602420	5604420	Well, how often?
5604420	5605420	What are we talking about?
5605420	5607420	Because, like, on my fingernails,
5607420	5609420	I'll be like, come on.
5610420	5612420	Again, with you?
5612420	5614420	Yeah, I know what you mean.
5614420	5617420	We don't need them to scratch and claw our way
5617420	5618420	to survival anymore.
5618420	5619420	I wish you could just take a pill.
5619420	5620420	I've said this before.
5620420	5621420	They're going to make a pill,
5621420	5622420	make our fingernails stop growing.
5622420	5624420	We don't need them no more.
5624420	5625420	Yep.
5625420	5627420	You should do if you drop a key.
5628420	5629420	Or a coin.
5629420	5630420	Or a credit card.
5630420	5633420	You're going to use your fingernails for picking up shit.
5633420	5635420	I ain't using no fingernails for that.
5636420	5637420	They're going to make keys better.
5637420	5638420	Put a little handle on them.
5638420	5639420	We're primates.
5640420	5642420	But the people that make the handles that go on keys
5642420	5644420	are going to need fingernails to create the tools
5644420	5645420	and the molds necessary.
5645420	5647420	You son of a bitch.
5648420	5651420	Are you going to be so elitist that you want to create
5651420	5654420	a superclass of people that don't need fingernails
5654420	5657420	and let the underclass have to have long fingernails
5657420	5660420	to make your weird key handles?
5660420	5661420	Yeah.
5662420	5663420	People wear glasses.
5663420	5666420	We didn't just start killing people that couldn't see.
5667420	5669420	We evolve our culture.
5669420	5670420	Rob didn't wear his.
5670420	5672420	He almost cut his dick off.
5675420	5677420	Connective tissue.
5680420	5681420	Wait, what was I going to...
5681420	5682420	Goddamn it, harm.
5682420	5683420	Cancer, cancer.
5683420	5684420	No, no, no.
5685420	5687420	You're like a saboteur.
5687420	5689420	I wasn't talking about cancer.
5689420	5690420	Fingernails.
5690420	5691420	Fingernail growth pill.
5691420	5692420	Fingernails growth, yeah.
5692420	5693420	Could it be a thing?
5695420	5696420	How often?
5696420	5697420	How often?
5697420	5699420	Yeah, not that it would mean anything to me,
5699420	5701420	but it was like, yeah, what is it, monthly, weekly?
5701420	5703420	Probably once every couple months.
5703420	5704420	Oh, really?
5704420	5706420	It depends on how fast it grows,
5706420	5708420	but I don't think it grows super fast or anything.
5708420	5709420	Yeah.
5709420	5711420	It's not like a daily routine.
5711420	5715420	You heard my lover say every seven days
5715420	5719420	she goes to a sci-fi laser clinic.
5719420	5720420	Laser?
5720420	5721420	That sounds dangerous.
5721420	5722420	Does it grow?
5722420	5723420	Dangerous.
5723420	5724420	Like arm hair doesn't grow.
5724420	5725420	When I first moved here,
5725420	5730420	one of my first famous sightings was Seal,
5730420	5733420	also known as Seal Henry Seal.
5733420	5735420	And I told a bunch of people this,
5735420	5737420	and one of my friends who was new...
5737420	5738420	Wait, I just...
5738420	5741420	What if the story had nothing to do with pubic hair at all?
5741420	5742420	And it's just like, Timur is just like,
5742420	5744420	he's having a stroke.
5746420	5748420	He just becomes a floyd the barber of our show.
5748420	5749420	Look it up, it's a reference.
5749420	5750420	All right, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
5750420	5752420	Leo Sayar floyd the barber.
5752420	5754420	That's just Scottish with an afro, right?
5754420	5755420	Yeah.
5755420	5756420	And no tea.
5758420	5759420	One of the friends I had from the Groundlings,
5759420	5760420	I was telling him this story
5760420	5762420	because I didn't have many L.A. stories,
5762420	5764420	so I was just saying, I just saw Seal.
5764420	5766420	He said, my friend or my roommate,
5766420	5770420	I can't remember, works in a spa or salon,
5770420	5774420	and Seal comes in and gets the full body wax.
5774420	5776420	The entire body, like his whole body.
5776420	5778420	He doesn't want any hair on his body.
5779420	5781420	And she said it was once a week, I think.
5781420	5783420	I would imagine, for me it would be.
5783420	5785420	He would have been in that area
5785420	5787420	because that's where the spa was or something.
5787420	5789420	That seems like an all or nothing thing.
5789420	5792420	If you have any hair at all, it's no good.
5792420	5794420	That was for his place.
5794420	5796420	I'm not saying I'm not willing to change.
5796420	5798420	I'm just saying, when I look at my body in the mirror,
5798420	5800420	I'm like, holy fuck, man.
5803420	5804420	Where would I start?
5804420	5805420	How would I know when I'm finished?
5805420	5808420	I can see how I don't look like guys on TV,
5808420	5810420	and I don't know if they're born different
5810420	5812420	or if they do stuff, but I'm like,
5812420	5814420	where would I fucking start, man?
5814420	5816420	I guess, you know what, I'd start on my shoulders
5816420	5818420	because I'm like, well, that's definitely not
5818420	5820420	what a cop looks like when he takes his shirt off.
5820420	5822420	If he's going to fight terrorists, I'd be like,
5822420	5823420	meow, meow.
5823420	5825420	And I would do that for a while.
5825420	5829420	I would try to make a selfie stick for my...
5829420	5831420	But then it was like, you go down
5831420	5833420	and then you look in the mirror and it's like,
5833420	5836420	oh, it looks like you took a paintbrush with skin on it
5836420	5839420	and painted over a hair wall.
5839420	5840420	I was like, where?
5840420	5841420	How do you...
5841420	5842420	I can't...
5842420	5844420	Short of bringing another horrified victim
5844420	5846420	into this process, what am I supposed to do?
5846420	5850420	I'm like, literally, I would try to like, meow, meow.
5850420	5851420	Don't do that.
5851420	5853420	That's a slippery slope.
5853420	5854420	So don't do that.
5854420	5857420	I look like Dan Hideo when I take my clothes off.
5857420	5859420	I mean, that's got to be...
5859420	5861420	I understand, oh, where she puts her lips
5861420	5862420	and what everything.
5862420	5864420	But how about where she puts her eyes?
5864420	5865420	Jesus Christ.
5865420	5867420	How about where she puts her integrity?
5867420	5871420	She must put it somewhere safe.
5871420	5874420	I think they're just better people, these ladies.
5874420	5877420	I don't want to make sweeping generalizations about...
5877420	5878420	They're not visually stimulated,
5878420	5881420	but something is just stopping my girlfriend
5881420	5886420	from making decisions based on reality.
5886420	5889420	So she somehow is able to live in some never-ending story
5889420	5891420	or something where, like, I look like a hot dog
5891420	5896420	or a Spider-Man or...
5896420	5900420	Just a memory from her childhood, maybe.
5900420	5905420	A big wad of cotton candy or a dove.
5905420	5908420	It's not about going through a full metamorphosis.
5908420	5910420	It's about just a little bit of...
5910420	5913420	A little bit of groundskeeping.
5913420	5914420	Just, I mean...
5914420	5916420	But here's the thing.
5916420	5918420	So imagine...
5918420	5920420	So I take off my shirt.
5920420	5921420	So what you're going to see...
5921420	5922420	You guys have seen it.
5922420	5925420	You have Ron Jeremy territory.
5925420	5929420	It's like I'm wearing a black, hairy shirt.
5929420	5932420	And it doesn't stop at my waist
5932420	5935420	because it doesn't know that it's a black, hairy shirt.
5935420	5939420	It keeps going down my thighs and everywhere.
5939420	5942420	For some reason, maybe because I wore socks for too long
5942420	5945420	when I was a kid, but it stops right at my ankles.
5945420	5948420	In a reverse hobbit thing.
5948420	5953420	So I have these beautiful, supple, baby-smooth, hairless feet.
5953420	5955420	Do you know what a reverse hobbit is?
5955420	5960420	$20, same as in town.
5960420	5967420	A reverse hobbit is a difficult situation, which suggests...
5967420	5971420	So also, I'm not saying I'm not going to do it.
5971420	5972420	I'm not arguing about...
5972420	5974420	I've inspired tonight, I'm going to put steps.
5974420	5976420	I'm going to have Steve schedule me a time to...
5976420	5978420	Leave Steve out of it.
5978420	5980420	Look, if he doesn't schedule you, it won't happen.
5980420	5982420	Your therapist is already worried about him.
5982420	5984420	But I'm just picturing this moment
5984420	5986420	when I'm standing at the foot of the bed
5986420	5988420	and I'm like...
5988420	5992420	Head to toe in this greasy, ursine fucking hair.
5992420	5995420	And then just like right at my crotch,
5995420	6000420	there's just like, oh, Tom Cruise is here.
6001420	6003420	And it's just like, there's nothing for some...
6003420	6006420	You strike balance.
6006420	6008420	It's not like the Hollywood sign where it's like,
6008420	6010420	we're going to get rid of this litter that will be Hollywood.
6010420	6012420	It's like, there's no sign, you know?
6012420	6015420	Your dick's going to pop, man.
6015420	6016420	It's going to be great.
6016420	6017420	It's going to pop.
6017420	6020420	It's going to draw the eye right to it, you know?
6023420	6025420	No, it's not going to pop.
6025420	6027420	No, I get scared.
6027420	6029420	I thought you knew something.
6029420	6031420	No, it's going to pop, baby.
6031420	6032420	Yeah, it's going to pop.
6032420	6034420	It's going to leap off the screen.
6034420	6035420	Yeah.
6035420	6037420	I'm really on tally for a second.
6037420	6040420	Once you pop, you can't stop.
6040420	6043420	Sorry, I cut somebody off who was talking.
6043420	6047420	It's going to want to make you reach in and grab it.
6047420	6050420	All right, well, I mean, you know, look,
6050420	6051420	it was uncontrollable.
6051420	6053420	The show just became about that.
6053420	6055420	We were happier then when I was talking about
6055420	6058420	Harvey Fierstein talking about Trump.
6058420	6060420	I mean, you know, dick hair is warm.
6060420	6062420	That's our domain.
6062420	6066420	I was thinking that the word Ursine actually entered
6066420	6067420	my head earlier today.
6067420	6069420	When you were looking at me.
6069420	6074420	No, there was a bare doctor drawn on the wall
6074420	6077420	of where we last shot.
6077420	6079420	You were there.
6079420	6081420	That was a chair moving.
6081420	6084420	There's no way that was a fart.
6085420	6088420	If it were a fart, then show's over.
6088420	6090420	Well, whose chair?
6090420	6091420	Whose chair was it?
6091420	6092420	It was someone in the audience.
6092420	6096420	Whose chair has that many mics on it?
6096420	6097420	I'm so sorry.
6097420	6100420	Oh, I thought you were using like a colloquialism.
6100420	6101420	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6101420	6102420	But you mean someone actually farted.
6102420	6103420	Yeah, there was a sound.
6103420	6104420	It was like home.
6104420	6106420	And Jeff went.
6106420	6108420	Anyways, I'm sorry.
6108420	6109420	There was a bare.
6109420	6113420	When we walked to where we shot the last shot today,
6113420	6114420	it was like a pharmacy.
6114420	6117420	And it had a cartoon bear doctor on the wall.
6117420	6120420	And for some reason, the word Ursine entered my head.
6120420	6121420	Oh.
6121420	6122420	And you just said it.
6122420	6123420	Oh.
6123420	6124420	Whoa.
6124420	6127420	You look like you were accepting anything.
6132420	6135420	That is a weird word to think of twice in a day.
6135420	6136420	Yeah.
6136420	6137420	When he said it, I...
6137420	6138420	Is there a word for...
6138420	6139420	When you...
6139420	6142420	You think of a word and then you start hearing it all the time?
6142420	6143420	I do that all the time.
6143420	6146420	Like read it and hear it at the same time?
6146420	6147420	Yeah.
6147420	6151420	I haven't thought of the word like porcine or whatever.
6151420	6152420	Yeah.
6152420	6153420	And then all of a sudden...
6153420	6154420	Oh, I read it and see it everywhere.
6154420	6155420	Yeah.
6155420	6157420	Oh, I thought you meant when you hear it and read it at the same time.
6157420	6158420	No, no, no.
6158420	6159420	A word that you think...
6159420	6160420	Oh, it's a word.
6160420	6161420	I keep hearing that word.
6161420	6162420	No, you always did.
6162420	6165420	That's kind of confirmation bias on the level, isn't it?
6165420	6166420	Oh, damn.
6166420	6168420	I mean, I don't think...
6168420	6169420	Damn.
6169420	6170420	Yeah.
6171420	6173420	You're just now noticing it.
6173420	6174420	It's now on your radar.
6174420	6178420	You've heard that mathematically the exact same amount of times, probably.
6178420	6179420	Yeah.
6179420	6183420	Is this related in the Uber to here?
6183420	6186420	I, for some reason, thought of Weird Al Yankovic.
6186420	6190420	And right after that, the Eye of the Tiger came on the radio,
6190420	6195420	and I could only hear the Weird Al Ryor, the Kaiser version of it.
6195420	6196420	I've never heard that one.
6196420	6197420	Ryor, the Kaiser?
6197420	6199420	Yeah, it's on in 3D.
6199420	6202420	The ballad of... theme to Rocky 12 or something.
6202420	6204420	So he's ordering a sandwich, and he's like...
6204420	6205420	He's a deli man.
6205420	6206420	Oh.
6206420	6208420	You want the Ryor, the Kaiser?
6208420	6209420	Exactly.
6209420	6210420	It's a Reuben tonight.
6210420	6211420	Exactly, exactly.
6211420	6212420	Gonna put some sauerkraut and then some...
6212420	6219420	Weird Al Yankovic is the Chuck Yeager of parody in that he broke the parody barrier by which
6219420	6226420	you can't tell if someone reads you a title of a song, whether it's a Weird Al Yankovic song
6226420	6231420	or a parody of a Weird Al Yankovic parody.
6231420	6236420	How would you write a joke where you're like, oh, Weird Al Yankovic did this song?
6236420	6239420	It's like, how would you tell the joke from reality?
6239420	6245420	You take a popular song and you turn it, make it about food, and by any means necessary,
6245420	6246420	that's what he really does.
6246420	6249420	Were you thinking I was making that up in the Rocky 12?
6249420	6252420	No, I was just marveling that if you had made it up, I wouldn't have been able to tell.
6252420	6253420	Sure.
6254420	6256420	I don't really have a strong opinion.
6256420	6262420	Our friend Dino hates Weird Al, like really, really, truly hates him.
6262420	6263420	I don't have a strong opinion.
6263420	6264420	I've met him once or twice.
6264420	6266420	He's a lovely, lovely fellow.
6266420	6267420	He's a good dude.
6267420	6273420	But I don't go out of my way to hear his stuff, but Ryor the Kaiser, I kind of like that one.
6273420	6274420	It's good.
6274420	6276420	Do you know Alan Sherman?
6276420	6277420	Sure, yeah.
6278420	6279420	That's easy originally.
6280420	6287420	I brought it up so it doesn't really count, but in the show today, I was singing A Taste of Honey.
6287420	6291420	He has one called A Waste of Money, and it's really funny.
6291420	6294420	Do we have an instrumental track that's good enough?
6294420	6298420	Not a rap beat, but just anything where I...
6298420	6304420	Jeff, I'll sing a song, straight up the middle one, and then you do the parody of it.
6305420	6307420	Why do I have to do all the hard work?
6308420	6312420	Okay, let me see if I have something instrumental.
6316420	6318420	This is real improv.
6327420	6329420	My song's the straight line.
6329420	6332420	And I have to do the Weird Al version of it.
6333420	6335420	You are my sweetie.
6335420	6340420	You are the sweetest thing I've ever seen today.
6340420	6342420	You are my sweetie.
6342420	6346420	And you are the best thing in the world.
6346420	6348420	I love my sweetie girl.
6349420	6351420	All right, I got it, I got it.
6353420	6355420	I Weird Alify that?
6355420	6356420	Yeah.
6362420	6363420	Here we go.
6374420	6376420	I love Bake Ziti.
6376420	6379420	It's my favorite pasta in the world.
6379420	6382420	It's a thick tubular pasta.
6382420	6383420	You can put sauce up.
6383420	6385420	I love Bake Ziti.
6385420	6389420	It's a great side dish with some meat or maybe some fish.
6389420	6391420	Also, I squeezed your tini.
6392420	6395420	All right, now I'm going to do one.
6395420	6397420	I'm going to do one.
6406420	6410420	You guys are applauding inverse show ending dynamics.
6412420	6417420	Yeah, tip that Hindenburg's nose cone toward the ground.
6418420	6422420	I don't want to thrust it upon you, but let's keep it going.
6422420	6424420	Let's pass the button now.
6424420	6427420	Damorage, you straight line this one.
6427420	6429420	Andrew, you Weird Al.
6429420	6431420	No, I didn't sign up for it.
6433420	6436420	If you don't have it, you're allowed to say pass.
6436420	6439420	Well, whatever the procedure is, that's what I'm doing.
6439420	6446420	All right, Damorage, you could just sing a straight song.
6446420	6449420	That might actually be a real song.
6470420	6471420	Okay.
6473420	6475420	That's a good song.
6476420	6477420	Wait, no.
6478420	6479420	Can I change the rules?
6479420	6482420	I want to know more at the second act of Monster Man.
6486420	6492420	What we know about him so far is he goes out in the daytime and the nighttime,
6492420	6496420	which we have every right to do.
6496420	6498420	These things happen.
6499420	6504420	However, he has a different relationship with the moon and the sun.
6504420	6506420	He's a Monster Man.
6507420	6511420	That was one of the most amazing fucking things I've ever...
6511420	6514420	This is just him and the turtle neck.
6514420	6517420	Gary Newman's song, it was really good.
6517420	6521420	There wasn't a single bumper, but it was when you look at their legs,
6521420	6523420	you're like, what the fuck?
6524420	6525420	But straight up the middle...
6525420	6527420	I like to go out and look inside.
6527420	6530420	I look at the sun, I like the day and the night.
6530420	6532420	I also am a Monster Man.
6537420	6539420	No one's ever called themselves a Monster Man.
6539420	6542420	The greatest hits of Frank Sinatra Jr. Jr.
6547420	6549420	That song doesn't deserve to be paradise.
6549420	6551420	That's too good on its own.
6551420	6554420	It's a very casual, confessional.
6555420	6558420	I got so many questions about Monster Man.
6558420	6562420	It seems like he just knows what he likes.
6564420	6566420	He likes walks in the daytime and the nighttime?
6566420	6569420	This is hubris, but let me try it.
6572420	6574420	I'm convinced that I can do it.
6576420	6578420	I'm going to give it the same track because I'm limited here.
6578420	6580420	Well, yeah, I'm doing his parody.
6581420	6593420	I like to go in the bun, and when I see the cars, I go by...
6598420	6600420	I'm a lobster can.
6600420	6611420	The larger joke is that I thought I could do it.
6613420	6615420	I thought it would just happen.
6615420	6616420	And I got greedy.
6616420	6618420	I was off the hook, and I was like,
6618420	6619420	Well, come on.
6619420	6621420	In all due respect, I'd like to give that a shot.
6621420	6623420	They were going to move on.
6623420	6625420	And I was like, come on.
6625420	6627420	I was like, you forgot something.
6628420	6631420	So you thought of lobster can only?
6631420	6633420	No, I swear, no, I did not.
6633420	6634420	I did not.
6634420	6635420	No, that's not fair.
6635420	6637420	I made it through two verses of shibberish.
6637420	6639420	I'd like to get the gabotage poo poo.
6639420	6641420	I thought you were having a lobster can.
6643420	6644420	I will show my work.
6644420	6646420	I'll tell you exactly what I thought.
6646420	6648420	When the pressure was on and I was listening to the mortgage
6648420	6652420	before everything gave way to holy shit, this is a toe tapper.
6653420	6656420	And we have a new fucking...
6656420	6659420	Harry Connick Jr. emerging.
6659420	6663420	I was like, I thought, I was like, well, he said,
6663420	6665420	I like to go in the sun.
6665420	6667420	And I was like, well, that should be a bun.
6667420	6668420	Because that's edible.
6668420	6669420	Right.
6669420	6671420	And then I did, I was like...
6671420	6673420	It's like the Enigma machine.
6675420	6678420	You guys, won't they say Heil Hitler and all the messages?
6681420	6685420	Translates everything into food for weird Al purposes.
6685420	6689420	I thought bun and I thought can.
6689420	6691420	I didn't know how to connect them.
6691420	6692420	Lobster came to me.
6692420	6693420	That's good.
6693420	6696420	Like fucking Joan of Arc style.
6697420	6699420	And that's actually probably what threw me.
6699420	6701420	Dance shit lobster can.
6701420	6702420	Dance from the top.
6702420	6704420	From the top, I want to hear the song lobster can.
6704420	6705420	Now you have a moment.
6705420	6706420	Now come on.
6706420	6707420	Are you ready?
6707420	6708420	Well, no a little bit.
6711420	6714420	Hey everybody out there, it's champagne time.
6716420	6717420	Grab your dance partner.
6717420	6721420	And we're doing something called the style dance.
6721420	6723420	I like to go in the bun.
6723420	6727420	And when I don't have the fun, I like to go in the car.
6727420	6730420	I have so many things to eat.
6730420	6733420	But I don't know what to do with my lobster can.
6735420	6736420	Lobster can.
6736420	6740420	It's a can full of lobster as fast as you can.
6740420	6743420	Why would you eat a lobster if it was so
6743420	6746420	un-fresh and had to come in a can?
6746420	6749420	I want to go with the park.
6749420	6753420	And when it's after dark, I see the elephant man.
6753420	6755420	I go and tug on his trunk.
6755420	6759420	And when I'm drunk, I need a lobster can.
6759420	6762420	Oh seafood, salty as can be.
6762420	6764420	I want to duck way off.
6764420	6765420	This is not matching the thing.
6765420	6766420	That's perfect.
6766420	6767420	That was fantastic.
6769420	6770420	But it's not.
6770420	6772420	It wasn't a parody.
6773420	6775420	Spencer, you want to give it a whirl?
6775420	6777420	You want to be straight man or punch line man?
6777420	6778420	I don't know.
6778420	6779420	Whatever you want.
6779420	6780420	I'll do whatever anyone wants me to do.
6780420	6781420	What do you think, Harmon?
6781420	6783420	Where is Spencer best served?
6783420	6787420	To be the one that sets it up for somebody or the one that brings it home?
6787420	6788420	I think he...
6788420	6789420	Honestly...
6789420	6793420	I think because you're a logician, you know, you're a...
6793420	6795420	Let's give him a straight one.
6795420	6796420	Andrew?
6796420	6797420	What?
6797420	6798420	I'm still out.
6798420	6799420	Andrew's out.
6799420	6801420	You're terrified right now.
6801420	6802420	Yeah, yeah.
6802420	6803420	No, no, no.
6803420	6804420	Jeff, come on.
6804420	6805420	Jeff, come on.
6805420	6806420	You...
6806420	6807420	Spencer does the straight line.
6807420	6809420	I just realized, you look like kind of like sexy young Bogdanovich.
6809420	6810420	You ever get that?
6811420	6812420	Jeff, that's awful.
6812420	6813420	That's awful.
6813420	6814420	No.
6814420	6815420	That's not true.
6815420	6816420	I said sexy and young.
6816420	6817420	Sexy young Bogdanovich.
6817420	6818420	Well, okay.
6818420	6820420	You look like a sexy young...
6821420	6823420	You already used elephant man.
6825420	6827420	He's a lobster can.
6828420	6829420	That's exactly...
6830420	6833420	There never was a sexy young Peter Bogdanovich.
6833420	6834420	There is now.
6834420	6835420	It's you.
6835420	6836420	What?
6836420	6837420	I mean that as a kind of thing.
6837420	6839420	I'm saying you're an attractive gentleman.
6839420	6842420	More attractive than the current Peter Bogdanovich.
6842420	6845420	No, I'm saying sexy young pre last picture show, you know,
6845420	6847420	Sybil Shepard fucking...
6847420	6849420	Like an 18 month window.
6849420	6851420	Yeah, he had his moment.
6851420	6852420	He wore bigger glasses though.
6852420	6853420	He had those big...
6853420	6855420	And still the cravat always?
6855420	6856420	Always did with the cravat.
6856420	6857420	Yeah, I know.
6857420	6858420	He's a terrible person.
6858420	6859420	I'm not saying you're like him.
6859420	6864420	He married Dorothy Stratton's sister after she was murdered.
6865420	6866420	Have you seen Star 80?
6866420	6867420	Oh shit, really?
6867420	6868420	Yeah.
6868420	6869420	No? Wow.
6869420	6870420	Okay, so he's...
6870420	6873420	I just wanted to besmirch Peter Bogdanovich.
6873420	6875420	That was my one goal for tonight.
6877420	6878420	No, he's famous.
6878420	6880420	I mean, that's the lore is that he's...
6880420	6882420	You know, it's like his...
6882420	6883420	I don't want to spread anything.
6883420	6884420	I think it's fact.
6884420	6887420	His wife was the juice, you know?
6887420	6888420	She was like...
6888420	6889420	She was the...
6889420	6891420	She was Dorothy Stratton.
6891420	6895420	The playboy playmate was murdered.
6895420	6897420	And she was his girlfriend.
6897420	6899420	And then she was murdered.
6899420	6901420	And then he married her sister.
6901420	6903420	I was like, well, you're still here.
6903420	6904420	Oh, okay.
6904420	6905420	This is a whole different...
6905420	6906420	What about the fact that...
6906420	6909420	Wait, who did he do last picture show with?
6909420	6910420	Oh, Sybil Shepard.
6910420	6911420	Right, no, but I mean...
6911420	6912420	Wait, was he with her?
6912420	6913420	No, he left...
6913420	6914420	No, he left...
6914420	6916420	He really Bob Thornton'd his wife for Sybil.
6916420	6917420	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6917420	6918420	His wife...
6918420	6920420	I wasn't like a costume designer record.
6920420	6923420	I wasn't gonna like flank him and attack him from all angles.
6923420	6926420	Your story is more...
6926420	6927420	I don't know.
6927420	6929420	I don't know which one's more incriminating.
6929420	6930420	That's all.
6930420	6931420	I only have one.
6931420	6934420	Peter Buckovich, if you're out there, we'd love to have you on the show.

6951420	6953420	But if you've got one...
6953420	6956420	If you're listening to it and you've got one, you're allowed to come in and do it.
6956420	6958420	Like whoever between us has it.
6958420	6959420	Okay, fine.
6959420	6960420	I'm not gonna have one.
6960420	6961420	All right, Spencer.
6961420	6964420	Whatever protocol I need to follow, then I have one.
6964420	6965420	I've been burnt.
6965420	6971420	Spencer, whenever you like to come in to the song, give us the...
6971420	6973420	The non-weird-out version.
6976420	6977420	Oh, look.
6977420	6979420	It's the sun and the moon.
6979420	6980420	Oh, shit.

6995420	6997420	Oh, hey, look.
6997420	7002420	I've got a bun and a spoon and a lobster can.
7002420	7007420	I'm gonna go and eat this canned lobster because I'm a...
7007420	7010420	I'm a monster man.
7014420	7019420	Well, now you've gone and put us into overtime.
7019420	7020420	Oh, shit.
7020420	7021420	You know how overtime works.
7021420	7022420	It's sudden death.
7022420	7023420	Yeah.
7023420	7027420	This is a sudden death round.
7027420	7028420	All right.
7028420	7030420	So here's some more from Des Moines.
7031420	7033420	Let's play a different song for Des Moines.
7033420	7035420	I say you straight, man, at Des Moines.
7035420	7036420	Take it home.
7043420	7046420	Tip, tip, tap, do you hear that tapping?
7046420	7050420	It's the sleepy man come to steal your sleep.
7050420	7054420	He's gonna go into your bedroom when your nightmares come.
7054420	7056420	That's when he'll creep.
7056420	7057420	Never stop.
7057420	7058420	Keep going.
7058420	7063420	His are yours to sell, but his are yours to sow and grow.
7063420	7066420	Sleepy man's gonna be in your head,
7066420	7070420	and if you don't come home, he'll be in your bed.
7070420	7073420	Sleepy man is a catch-all boogie man.
7073420	7076420	He's gonna do things to you bad.
7076420	7079420	Sleepy man's always following you.
7079420	7083420	He's a metaphor for mental illness.
