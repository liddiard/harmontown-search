43840	52480	Yeah, rap, yeah, rap, rapping to the beat isn't easy.
52480	55480	George didn't fuck wheezy without some effort.
55480	60800	He had to put it in and he had to get up in the morning, go to the gym and say, I want
60800	61800	to rap today.
61800	65840	I got to put my effort in and make it my way.
65840	68080	I'm going to rap at the top of the show.
68080	74120	It's just a thing I do so, you know, gotta get the energy up, gotta keep me on my toes
74120	75720	so the show is good.

125540	126680	All right, all right, all right, stop here.
126720	128420	You can do that all now.
128440	128820	Thank you.
128840	133720	I like to rap at the top of the show, it's not because I thinkantom good at rapping,
133760	137960	It's not because I think it's a good way to start the show, it's because I want to
137960	140200	be flat-footed as they say in D&D.
140200	144000	Yeah, you don't love that dexterity.
144000	149600	If I come up here knowing what I'm gonna do, then it's- it's death for everybody.
149600	153640	Welcome to the show, thank you for paying five dollars, if you're watching it right
153640	158200	now, thank you for nothing, if you're listening to it for free, thank you for your judgment,
158200	163040	thank you for judging me, I make a convenient target, you're welcome, I'm not complaining
163040	168160	about that, I'm 45, all I want to do is get out, I just want to get out.
168160	173480	I watched the post, it's bad, it's a bad movie.
173480	182600	Steven Spielberg is no longer a good director, I don't know when he was good last, I know
182600	189400	he was good for a good long time and that he deserves all of the credit in the world
189400	195880	for being a wonderful, wonderful director who did such things as, for instance, adapting
195880	203360	a book about sharks into anything with empathy, it was neat, he would add a couple shots in
203880	210280	it, there's a shark in the water but this guy loves his kid, terrific, we built an empire
210280	218480	on this, okay, I watched the post, you know, you suck, it's a bad movie, it's terrible.
218480	219480	Performances?
219480	221640	Performances, bad.
221640	227200	Director's fault, good actors, gotta be the director's fault, like awful, Tom Hanks is
227200	231000	acting like he's doing dinner theater, he's doing a character, I don't know what's happening
231000	236440	in that movie, it looks like an impression, it looks like a crazy person showed up on
236440	243080	your doorstep having seen five minutes of all the president's men and he's just outside
243080	250600	your house kicking at the door, it's a horrible, horrible movie and if you like it you're stupid
250600	256520	and if you nominated it for an award you're dumb and you don't deserve that vote, you
256520	261880	get your vote wrong, you cheated someone out of it, it's a dumb movie, it's terrible,
261880	265000	I couldn't finish watching it, it's awful, what's next?
265000	271720	Florida Project, ripped off, totally snubbed, you're using kids, kids are fucking monsters,
271720	275080	they're animals, it's like directing cats, you get a performance out of kids, you're
275080	281640	automatically nominated for best director, period, it's not nominated, I don't understand,
281640	285000	I don't get you anymore, you're an academy, you have one job.
289000	293560	What else was nominated? Get Out, did you finally see Get Out?
293560	299560	Get Out, I enjoyed very much, I saw it, I'm not racist, I saw it, I liked it,
301640	305160	call me by your name, all right here's the thing kids,
305880	314440	let's just look at it this way, 2000, whatever this is, it wasn't a year for storytelling,
314440	322680	I get it, I don't see it, apparently movies are just about hanging out, that's fine,
322680	329880	I kind of like to call me by your name, you can tell the director's good, three hours
329880	337240	to show me that, I don't, just look, you know what, fine, I don't want to talk about it anymore.
337240	338040	Beautiful movie though.
338040	340760	I just want to shit on Spielberg's head and go, you should know better,
342360	349480	fuck you, what is your camera fucking, why did you lay down track for a shot in a restaurant,
349480	354760	why would you use credence in a fucking Vietnam scene, are you dead?
355240	361800	Stop it, not everybody goes to work every day, yeah, well then don't go to work at all,
362680	368600	all I want is to get out, and there are people that have so much money they could have been out
368600	376200	decades ago and they just hang out making shit, and I'm like you're mocking me, I want to die,
376200	383080	I just want to draw the blanket of retirement over my body, I need one thing,
383160	391720	I need one thing, 150 million dollars, I've calculated it, if I put that in the bank,
391720	394680	don't mock me for my goals, I've done the math.
394680	397480	How did you do the math, was this with the Sklar brothers?
397480	406760	150 million dollars, I've crunched the numbers, that means that even if I spend 2 million dollars
406760	415480	a year, I can live another 75 million dollars, 75 years, that's my math, good math, so you bought a
415480	419560	cryo, thank you, I know you're being sarcastic but thank you, sorry, what was Brandon saying,
419560	426600	I wasn't being sarcastic, yes you were, I thought it was a cryo chamber, because 75 more years is
427560	434600	ambitious, there's all this inflation stuff, I'm not mad at Spielberg, I don't want beef,
435560	439880	I want beef, I don't want Spielberg's podcast to start shooting, we're calling you out,
439880	446040	shooting over at me, it just, look, I saw Stephen, I saw the shot,
447800	450760	where Streep comes into the restaurant, she's meeting Tom Hanks for the first time,
454280	457160	why did the camera go all the way to the right, and then all the way to the left,
458040	464520	you're out of your mind, you've lost your mind, it's a scene about two people having breakfast,
464520	471320	you should have worked with the actors, Tom Hanks, he's gone off the rails, which is ironic because
471320	477720	your camera is on fucking railroad tracks that took three days to bolt into the floor of a
477720	483880	restaurant, you probably put out a business or a four-walled set that you created in Uganda because
483880	489960	the sound sounds more restaurant-y there, pay attention to your actors, the guy's got cotton
489960	493800	balls on his lips or something, he's doing like a weird impression of Tommy Lasorda, I don't know
493800	497080	what he's doing, I don't know what Meryl Streep's doing, I don't know what anyone in that movie's
497080	505160	doing, everyone's walking around these old sets going like, you got the byline, I don't understand
505160	510600	it, it's a weird, weird, weird movie, and if anyone had any objectivity they'd go, what is happening,
510600	514040	why is this movie happening, I don't know why I'm supposed to be watching this, this is a weird
514040	517480	movie, but we don't have any objectivity, we're just like, oh this was designed to win an Oscar,
517480	521080	so we're gonna nominate it for an Oscar, it doesn't deserve an Oscar, you're fucking insane,
521080	526920	it's a terrible movie, I shut it off after a half an hour, I can't stand it, I couldn't hear
526920	531560	it over me jerking off, I had to masturbate during your movie to make me interested in it.
531560	539240	It just got real Argo up in here, do you think it is Spielberg's attempt to make a Scorsese
539240	547240	type of film? I think there may have been some Scorsese influences on the goals of that movie,
547240	552680	because there would be like, the people would walk into a New York newspaper office or something,
554120	559560	but there'd be a fire hydrant that would have a liquid spring, and then someone would go, whoa,
559560	567080	whoa, and it got a defeat, and everyone was lit weird, there'd be like a little girl going,
567080	573560	extra, extra, it was weird, I don't care though, this is not my job, I don't care anymore,
573560	578120	I just want out, if you're hearing the sound of my voice, and you're like, oh Dan, I don't like you,
578760	586200	join the club, I don't wanna be here anymore, I don't wanna be talking to you, I don't want you
586200	590520	listening to me, I don't wanna have an opinion, I don't want my opinion to matter, I just want
590520	597880	money, I just want enough money to get a fucking break, like if I had been born with the amount
597880	606040	of money that normal people have when they're born, I would never have been doing this,
606040	612040	I would be under a rock somewhere minding my own business, I made myself out of dirt without
612040	617720	permission, what else are we talking about? Okay, real quick though, where are you? Not real quick,
617720	624280	fill your time, I have no show, I'm trying to pump up controversy. Where the fuck would you go?
624280	628280	Where would I go? Where are you trying to escape to right now? Because I know what you're talking
628280	636840	about, you got some post success blues, which are real, it's totally real to be super well fed and
636840	642200	happy, and have lost the thing that made you run through the jungle, so now you get depressed on
642200	646680	some new shit, you know what I mean? It's like, if you had had, say your appendix out, and you've
646760	649800	worried about that for two months, and then they took it out, and you weren't in pain anymore,
649800	653800	you might have a rash that bothered you like your appendix used to, because we're used to living in
653800	659400	some sort of crazy fear, right? Right, I'm following you. Where would you go to to escape you? Bed.
660600	664920	Yeah, you don't even think like you're not going, like there's no desert, there's no another country,
664920	670280	like Amsterdam for two months. No, I like the United States, I like that when you take a shit,
670280	675800	it's in a bucket of water that makes the shit disappear. They have that in Amsterdam? Yeah.
677320	678760	I hear that's big in Japan.
680600	685880	Don't you dare high road me. Can you brag about some dope shit we have? I don't want to go to,
685880	690360	I assume, you know, when people talk about, oh, I love it in Norway or Amsterdam or whatever,
690360	694920	you know what, I got to assume, I think those people are lying, right? It's got to be better
694920	698840	here than anywhere. Am I wrong? What do you think? Depends on what you're into. If you're into like
698840	703400	kicking it at like two or three, you want Brazil, you want France. If you're into like safety, when
703400	708360	you walk home as drunk as you want, you want like Norway, Amsterdam, like, you know, you can
708360	714600	do a different kind of party all over the planet. All right. Well, you make it sound like not getting
714600	719240	stabbed when you're walking home is like a menu item. Well, think about it like this. If you get
719240	723320	drunk in New York or Chicago or Los Angeles and you leave a bar, you leave a club, like you just
723320	727000	made a mistake. You could get stabbed. But if you're in a foreign country, like the places where
727000	733080	they're kind of decent. Right. But the place you just were is shitty, right? Or it's one of three
733080	738280	places that is open. I don't know. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. The trade off is you can get,
738280	748040	you can get a little clarity in those places. But are you comfortable making the assumption that
748040	757480	for everybody's like mocking us that America is probably the best to like, like we make an easy
757480	764280	target. Oh, you guys suck. You know, you don't want to be there. Your guns and your violence
764280	769480	totally agreed. But when we compare ourselves to other countries, we go like, did you know in
769480	775400	Sweden that you can leave your bike on the sidewalk and just jerk off on it and like roll
775400	779880	into the storm drain and the storm drain will take you to the nearest hospital for free? Like
781480	785560	you hear these things and I'm not saying they're not true, but I'm just assuming that that probably
785560	790360	means that like there's got to be some trade off. Like maybe their cable sucks. I don't know.
790360	794680	But that's true. But the visit is the thing. The thing is to like sort of go someplace,
794680	799240	look at things differently, get that perspective. You want me to fall into the trap where I use
799240	807240	the only money I do have traveling around going like, oh, I like the Yukon. I like the wheat patch.
807240	814360	I like the turkey farm. I got to tell you that that's the root. When you had no money, you would,
814360	818520	if you had like a thousand bucks, you'd spend 800 bucks on a trip. You would. And then you'd be
818520	821640	like, fuck it. When I get back, I'll figure out how to manage this 200 bucks into another 800
821640	826600	bucks. But now you got cash, you got nervous and shit. So you stop taking risks. I feel you,
826600	832440	but it's time to like, seriously, like maybe take some trips. Dream life. Dream life. Here it is.
833400	843240	Bed. California King. Cody. Me. Comforter. The dogs. They're fine. We'll deal with them.
845800	850680	Forensic files. Netflix. Everything. All of it. Everything available to watch.
851640	854120	I'm going to complain about all of it. Spielberg. You heard me.
855560	859800	Keep making shit. I'll keep fucking shooting it back in your face. What have you done?
860040	867000	You barfed it on me. I'll barf it right back at you. I enjoy it. You enjoyed it. You didn't suffer
867000	874040	during that movie. I could tell. You started this. If you were hurting while you made that movie,
874040	881400	I'll give you a million dollars. You were definitely happy. You were in a hammock.
882120	892680	But I want to be in bed with Cody. Laptop. For just want to learn Maya. I'm learning Maya right
892680	899400	now. 3D modeling. And just watching things. And then I want to wake up the next morning.
900120	905880	And I don't want to have to go to work. I want to stay in bed with Cody. And then I want to stay in
905880	912520	bed. And then go to sleep again. And then wake up the next day. I want to just keep doing that.
912520	916040	I think you can. That's what I'm saying. I think you can. God knows I've tried.
917240	925560	We're trying. But I don't. But you can't. You live in a house and the house is a mortgage.
925560	933480	And then the water comes from a place. And they go, we need our money for the water. And there's
933480	936680	dirt people. They're like, oh, you have dirt. You're going to pay your dirt rent.
937800	943720	The dogs have chips in their brains revolved out of the chips. Give the dog cancer.
945400	951080	There's iron outside your fence to keep people from getting in to spread their pore germs on you.
951080	957240	But the iron, if you don't replace it, it gets rusty. There's cameras. And the cameras got to
957240	962280	be upgraded. And the stereo system is never enough. You can't just listen to Phil Collins.
962280	968840	You can't just press play and listen to fucking Phil Collins. Everything costs $200,000, $300,000,
968840	975800	$400,000. And then the guy that tells you all this, he costs 50 grand a month. And your publicist,
975800	981880	whose job is to keep you less famous than you are, just keep me out of the news.
981880	988840	Three grand a month. I got people paying people to pay people to pay people to count money. I
988920	996200	don't care if I have. I just want to die. Not really literally die. I want to go to sleep.
997400	1004520	I want to hang out. You got those new money blues. And I'm not complaining. It sounds a lot like I
1004520	1012520	am. It's not. It's not. It's a real thing. I'm only saying during this time between 45 and 50,
1012520	1016440	I'm going to spend the next five years working as hard as I can. I'm going to try to bring the kids
1016440	1024360	quality entertainment. During that five years, Mr. Spielberg, could you please stop making films
1024360	1034680	or actively start making them? This difference you've split is offensive. I can tell you weren't
1034680	1043960	on set. It shows. I can tell, baby. I'm psychic. I've got Hackdar. I know when you weren't on set.
1046280	1052840	And to just be shipped in a pneumatic tube from your fucking asshole to the academy,
1052840	1058520	fucking is bullshit. Because if you shot that on an iPhone and you were like Dominican and were like,
1058520	1063640	I made a movie about the Washington Post. They'd be like, so? He'd be like, Dan, I got a lawn
1063640	1068360	and I got water and there's a rusty fence and I got a house I got to pay for. And I got all this
1068360	1073960	shit too. Yeah. Well, I'm not. I'm sure he's got a small army. I just get he's going to pay for the
1073960	1079160	laser dots. You can see all over my head right now. Those are those are those aren't cheap.
1079880	1089560	I like get out. Good. Good. Good. What do you like about it? No. All right. Let's not start. What
1089640	1094040	do you like about it? It was great. I love that it was the love the guy that gets his got out.
1094040	1103400	That sounds real. I love it when the guy got out. Spoilers. But did the guy truly get out?
1103400	1107960	Well, I mean, you know, I, I, I didn't see the movie. Well, I don't know what happens.
1107960	1121320	Spoiler alert. It's America. I liked any itonia. I liked itonia. Did itonia get nominated for
1121320	1129800	anything? I don't think so. See, it's no country for molds. Harbins. I don't I don't I like I'll
1129800	1134360	bother to watch these young people's movies. I'll go like, Oh, I like that. Well, a Florida project.
1134360	1138840	Oh, well, you know, I don't. Well, it's got to be hard to direct a bunch of fucking kids running
1138840	1145320	around. Willem Dafoe. You add him to like, well, just give the person a director. Obviously,
1145320	1152040	that's a hard movie to direct. Yeah. And it was just a nomination. Yeah. So no, no, no, no
1152040	1158200	nomination. Well, come on, you're being silly then. Any love for Ebbing at all? What? The billboards,
1158200	1168040	three billboards. Oh boy. You know, no. OK. No. OK. I watched it. I like all the actors. I don't
1168040	1180120	look. I'm sorry. I don't know. I thought it was trite. I thought it was trite. Oh, Spencer got
1180120	1186600	those boos. Spencer, you loved it. Oh boy. I couldn't get enough. Those performances. I thought
1186680	1190600	there could have been two billboards. Those billboards. Oh, no. I think there could have
1190600	1202200	been five easy. I thought, you know what? Here we go. I don't like that fucking Netflix show at the
1202200	1206680	end of the fucking world. I don't know anything about that show. And I hate it.
1209160	1213000	I don't I don't like the look of that guy's eye. I don't like anything.
1213000	1215880	Name a thing. Try to find something I like. I don't like anything.
1217560	1225880	Olives. Ice cream has its moments. Minecraft is OK. Kettle One. Kettle One Sog. Come on.
1226440	1231320	I was I was talking about movies. Oh, yeah. Robo Top. What about the new season of Black Mirror?
1231320	1234760	I haven't seen it. What are you? That's the thing. When something threatens to be good,
1234760	1237880	I don't watch it. I haven't watched Atlanta yet. I don't watch Black Mirror. You don't
1237880	1242120	watch Atlanta yet? No, I haven't. I'm racist. I'm racist. I'm racist. You deserve everything
1242120	1247480	that happens to you. That show would make you so happy. You would love it for so many reasons.
1247480	1252440	It's right up your alley. You'll love that. I don't want to be happy. And also don't wait
1252440	1255720	because I because I don't know that, you know, season three and fours and fives are going to
1255720	1260360	be as good as one or two. Oh, no. Oh, God. You'll be mad. You'll be like, damn, why
1260360	1264200	don't I start to like the show? It's already going five seasons. I already want it. What am I going
1264200	1268520	to do? Go. Oh, this show's good. Everyone's going to go. Oh, Dan likes that show. It doesn't matter.
1268520	1271800	Like what? So you get the enjoyment of the show. And then what happens? I'm trying to tell you to
1271800	1281720	help you stay in bed. Yeah, watch some Atlanta, stay in bed. Forensic files. The big sick. Dan
1281720	1286840	loves it. I haven't seen it. He loves it. I haven't watched it. I won't watch it.
1287720	1291480	No, I don't want to I don't want to stand the chance of anybody making me feel good.
1292760	1296760	I want to I want to I want to drown in hatred. Well, just focus on the part where she gets sick.
1296760	1303800	Yeah, you can watch that over and over. Fast forward to the I bet I bet she gets sick 30
1303800	1308440	minutes in. I just want to see the sick parts. I'm really here just for the sick parts. Yeah,
1308440	1312520	no, it's good. It's good. You guys confronted me on this. It's like, oh, I'm not I'm not actively
1312520	1316600	exposing myself to things that I have reason to believe will be good. So why am I complaining
1316600	1322120	about things that I I just thought the post would be good. And Stephen, can I call you Stephen?
1322840	1328920	I don't think he'd like that. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's going to be ugly in the streets.
1329880	1333880	All right. Talk of shit from Birkland. You can watch the big sick on Pornhub.
1335640	1341720	That's what I heard. It's true, you guys. Thank you, Brandon Johnson, for subbing in for Jeff
1341720	1348360	Davis. Yeah, I do the best I can. It's a very, very hard job. But I'm so, so psyched to be here.
1349080	1353960	Thanks, man. I'm still unsure of whether or not I want, you know, like, do we want the people
1353960	1365400	in the house to be laughing and clapping or? Yeah. No, no. Well, you don't have to. You can
1365400	1370440	have your own opinion. Right. Exactly. Who am I? Just subbing right now. I probably
1371240	1378200	wish to just wait my turn. Okay. Well, I'm going to start my movie. The movie is going
1378200	1383480	to start in Vietnam. Well, what should we what music should be used? I can read it, but I could
1383480	1388360	whip up a nice Vietnam score for you. No credence. What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that
1388360	1394520	song about running through the jungle? Will you stop it? Stop it. Credence, man.
1401000	1404760	We could always we could always shift gears and maybe and bring up our guest.
1404840	1407960	Oh, is he here? That's what I heard. Yeah, that is the room.
1408600	1413000	All right. Well, maybe I've rubbed you the wrong way tonight. Who? Steven Spielberg.
1415880	1417000	Or is that a song title?
1419640	1424520	I just want to get on everybody's good side. And, you know, maybe I don't have the
1425640	1430600	personality or the reputation for that. So why don't I bring up our guest? Is he really here?
1431560	1433160	John Mayer's here. Let's bring up John Mayer.
1434920	1436440	Very special harm in town.
1440680	1449800	Yo, yo, yo, John Mayer coming to the stage. John Mayer on the fucking rage blues rock pop soul.
1449800	1458680	Fuck your mama on a donut roll. Donuts don't have rolls. Fuck your mama in a hole. I'm getting nervous
1458680	1469880	because you're a famous lyricist. Yo, John Mayer. He's here. John Mayer's here. Let's talk to John Mayer.
1471640	1477480	Oh, yeah. I want to be the guy. I want to be the guy who hears the other rapper rap and then
1477480	1483240	like quickly associates other words to shout out. Yeah, that's an answer to it. That's the hardest
1483240	1489160	part. I try to do that every night. Yeah, that's so hard. Sometimes I'm like MC nubs and it's like
1489160	1493400	the best I could pull out. It's not easy. Yeah. And there's so many rap songs that don't have that.
1493400	1498360	You can go back in time and just add it to all the other songs out of there. And people do. Yeah.
1498360	1503480	And we release them. Yeah, I do it. I think that I think that we put out a glass for you
1503480	1508360	with a lemon wedge. I got this from my hotel room. All right. What is that? What you got there? It's
1508360	1513800	a kombucha. Oh, nice. Do you like that? I haven't had a type I've liked so far, but I'm still open to
1513800	1520360	it. I quit drinking. And so I find that this takes the place of a curiously strange bubbly drink that
1520360	1526680	I'm not sure if I like. Yeah. Yes. That is perfect for that. Each sip just creates more curiosity as
1526680	1533800	to what the fuck I'm drinking. Can I swear? Yeah. Yeah. Please do. Yeah. We prefer it. Thank you.
1533800	1541320	Sometimes I'll be laying in bed and I'll hear it. And I'll be like, what is it? And I'll turn over
1541320	1547080	and it's my kombucha bottle where the cap wasn't totally on and it scares me. It emits like a.
1547080	1552440	Yeah. The carbonation, you know. Yeah. Yeah. It ferments. Right. Over time. Over time. Yeah.
1552440	1562600	It gets hot. It screams. Yeah. What is there? I started washing a bottle out in my sink that's
1562600	1568760	like a drinking bottle. And I put like, I have a thing on my sink that emits boiling water. And so
1568760	1573480	I fill the thing with boiling water because I don't, I'm like, oh, I'm getting an end run around
1573480	1580680	washing things. And I fill the cup with boiling water and I seal it shut and then I shake it and
1580680	1586360	it's got boiling water in it. And then when I unscrew it, how come it goes? Right. What happened
1586360	1590840	in that short period of time? What is it? It was already hot water, but the air wasn't hot. What
1590840	1595800	is it, Spencer? What's, what's, is it steam? I don't understand. It's sizzling like it sounded
1595800	1601320	like you're making the sound like when you open a bottle of soda kind of hiss. Yeah. It's like
1601320	1605880	just a little one though. It's like, what is that? What did you, what were you keeping from me? Yeah.
1605880	1610360	It's just gotta be like pressurized somehow, I would guess. I don't know. When you poured it
1610360	1614520	in there, the air was not warm. It probably has nothing to do with me shaking it. It's probably
1614520	1620840	just hot water steaming already. You, you seal it up. It didn't matter what I did. And then I,
1620840	1625960	you steam, steam pressure. It's a platonic engine. Yeah. I think that's it. That's how trains are
1625960	1632840	made. Right. That's how trains work. Trains work. John Mayer. We just met today. Yeah.
1633720	1643720	Seven time Grammy winner. Whoa. Looked it up. You're welcome. Good host, good host,
1643720	1649320	good interviewer. Yeah. How did we meet? Tell, let's tell the story. We just met an hour ago.
1649320	1654840	We met like six hours ago. I'm a huge fan of Rick and Morty, like everyone else is. And I tend to
1654840	1659240	dive deep when I like something. Um, you don't want to be the friend in my life who likes something
1659240	1665080	and then turns me onto it because I will swiftly just railroad you with my being into it 20 times
1665080	1669160	more than you are within a short period of time. And I did that and I became a big fan. And then I
1669240	1674040	reached out to somebody from your show. Or what I usually do is I just make such a big whoop
1674040	1680040	on social media. You know, I tend to sort of manifest my desires by way of Twitter and just
1680040	1685800	creating a stir. And one of your producers reached out, I think. Uh-huh. And, um. Was that Steve
1685800	1693800	Levy? I think it was Mike. Uh, Mike. Oh, Mike Mandel. Mike Mandel. Yeah. Oh, Mike McMahon. Yeah.
1693800	1699800	A lot of Mike's going on. Yeah. And, uh, all I need is one Mike. Okay. Thanks. That's a nice
1699800	1704520	reference. Nice, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks. Thanks. Well done. Thanks. Um, and, uh, and then
1704520	1710280	I met a really sweet guy on your crew who's one of the artists. His name is Cory. Cory. Never met him.
1710280	1718360	Yep. He invited me to the taping of the season three DVD commentary. And I came, veiled myself
1718360	1722200	to actually sitting in the room and talking on a DVD with you guys. Here's the fun part. It's
1722200	1726600	like, I'm already aware that I'm behind the eight ball when it comes to my name and certain people
1726600	1730920	enjoy Rick and Morty because of the fact it does not contain any John Mayer elements in it.
1732920	1737720	A lot of them. Certain things are just have their strength from me not being involved in it in any
1737720	1744360	way. And I like to close that gap. And there I was. And I wasn't on the first, I wasn't on the
1744360	1749720	first commentary that they did today, but I was on what ended up, what will end up being the very
1749720	1755160	first episode on the commentary in the sequence, which makes me look even nervous than I already
1755160	1761880	am. But we got to talking and I think I found a certain familiarity in both your, your, uh,
1761880	1768280	intelligence and your unhappiness. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. I mean, it really is true. I had a great day
1768280	1774440	today cause I met John Mayer. I like, like, I, I was like, I'm not miserable, but like, I don't
1774440	1782760	get to complain about the things that I have to complain about to anybody but John. We were like,
1782760	1789560	standing in a kitchenette, eating pepperoni pizza, talking about how a hard Google autofill can be.
1789560	1795160	Yeah. I was saying that how merciless. Well, I don't know that anybody searches,
1795160	1799400	does anybody just Google search a celebrity name to find out what's going on? If it's
1799400	1804040	unless you're the celebrity, like does Google, is anybody here like, like, what's going on with
1804040	1809640	Gaga and just throw in lady Gaga? Yeah. Like it's been two years. I think what's happening.
1809640	1814120	What makes that kind of curious? Oh, really? Just to catch up sometimes when you're a fan.
1814120	1819000	I mean, uh, I'm a fan of a ton of people. So I, I catch up. I mean, I was looking at like, uh,
1819000	1824200	aerobics, uh, icons from the eighties before I got here. Yeah, but that's not by name. Oh,
1824200	1827640	yeah. I guess so. That's a little bit like a, where are they now? Like Cynthia Carolek.
1828280	1834680	Well, you know, it's like Denise Austin. Sure. Jane Fonda. Yeah. My mother used to have Jane
1834680	1838840	Fonda, Jane Fonda LP. You fall down those rabbit holes. Yeah. That's how I discovered the Jacksons.
1839800	1847080	Because Can You Feel It was the song for the Jane Fonda and she would say one vertebrae at a time,
1847080	1851800	lifted up one vertebrae. Can you feel it? And my mother was there.
1851800	1860440	Funny way to get indoctrinated into the love of the Jacksons. One vertebrae at a time.
1860440	1866680	You're slightly younger than me, but I, I came of pubescence and at the, at the height of the
1866680	1873320	aerobics, uh, movement. And, uh, that was my girlfriend shifting uncomfortable.
1873320	1877480	Is that to suggest that it served a purpose beyond aerobic?
1877480	1884120	Yeah. I wasn't the most fit, uh, 13 year old boy, uh, in the world. And yet I watched a lot of,
1884120	1890840	uh, syndicated, uh, aerobics programs. Sometimes I get upset when I watch porn
1890840	1896600	that I can see everything. I remember not seeing everything and fighting with my eyes.
1896600	1903160	Well, do you know that there's a, I mean, one thing I started typing in fully closed or even
1903160	1908200	just brought ads and stuff like wanting to see beyond things is very erotic.
1908200	1913720	Or wanting to, it could be a creepier thing where you want to see what you see every day
1913720	1917240	and you want to sexualize that instead of someone who's just available.
1917240	1918680	I got, I can get, I can get with that.
1918680	1923080	I, I, I, yeah, I, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't judge it either way, but I,
1923080	1928920	yeah, I, I've, I've found myself like typing in like there and they found out there's an abbreviation.
1928920	1940360	It's, uh, it's a genre of porn. It's, uh, C-N-F-N-N-M, closed female, new male.
1941240	1945480	I don't know why the guy has to be naked. That's not on my, because it's humiliating.
1945480	1948120	Well, he doesn't seem humiliated. No, he's into it.
1948120	1955560	I think, I think it's exactly to your point. It has this sense of, um, extreme ease, the idea that,
1955560	1959240	well, it really, it really is the manifestation of what you see a lot going on in the news right
1959240	1964120	now. Apparently that's how most people want to work in the office. Just nothing on.
1965160	1968360	Yeah. I mean, well, yeah, what's going on in the news right now?
1968360	1975400	Well, it seems to be a lot of that, that kind of sexualization of the idea that I'm going to turn
1975400	1979160	what seems to be a very matter of fact moment into something sexual, which I think is where
1979160	1983880	the root of C close. You have to work it out. It's like, yeah, you really do every time.
1983880	1987640	It's a Roy G. Biv, really. You could have called it a Roy G. Biv.
1987640	1995480	Yeah. Most of the stuff in my, in that folder that I hope no one finds, it really resembles
1995480	2000600	things that don't, they don't hardly recognizable as, as porn.
2000600	2005880	I understand. I'm into the sleight of hand of it as well. No pun. I enjoy, I enjoy the subtle,
2005880	2010600	like the subtlety. I friggin love it. I friggin love it.
2010600	2013560	All right. Well, let's pull back out to the, to the bigger picture.
2014280	2020840	Um, uh, fame, uh, the difficulty with it. I, I was, there was a certain point where it was like,
2020840	2025720	you gotta come on the podcast and we're going to have this conversation because why? I don't know,
2025720	2028760	because I'm a narcissist and I don't want to continue to have it privately because I might
2028760	2036040	accidentally make a front. I, I, I just want, but, but it was like, it, it, and we were both like,
2036040	2041560	as long as we don't take a what was me stance, it would be really funny to talk about like how.
2042440	2046200	I think, I think there's a lot to work with in it. As your therapist might say,
2046200	2050840	there's a lot to work with you. Follow that. Do you, do you actively, uh, are you in therapy?
2050840	2055800	Yes. How long have you been in therapy? I've been in therapy for years, but my current
2055800	2063080	relationship of man versus therapist has been since like 2009. Um, and I don't really think
2063080	2068280	about it in the, in the overall machinations of fame, the way you would normally think about it.
2068280	2072520	I don't, I don't really have that ad hoc relationship anymore with the world. Like I
2072520	2077880	am subject thing. I do is famous. I think I've sort of particleized it in a good way,
2077880	2082440	like over time with kind of going up and down so many times or changing my name or
2082440	2088760	musically changing my name. I feel like I carry like six musical passports and like the perfect
2088760	2095160	backdrop for this is that as we speak, like the Grammy after parties are taking place in New York
2095160	2102040	city and I'm not there. And that's something that's, that's a thing. That's a thing. I put
2102040	2105960	a record out this year. I made a record and thought that when I was making it, there's,
2105960	2110040	there's no way this can't hit. And that's what you're supposed to think when you make something.
2110040	2113080	Don't you think that when you're making something every time that it's, it's going to hit.
2113080	2118920	Yeah. But I want to make sure that we can connect our, uh, because not being a musician,
2118920	2125880	I just want to make sure that we understand what we're talking about. Cause like me putting
2125880	2131800	something out, uh, versus you putting something out can be a totally different thing. Um,
2131800	2139960	but w so, uh, not being at the Grammy after parties in New York means very carefully,
2139960	2146440	not invited, didn't attend or did not get nominated. Uh, didn't, didn't break through
2147160	2153240	with my record. And I find that actually like, I used to find it really sad and now I find it
2153240	2158200	really empowering somehow or another. I feel like it like drives me pretty hard. Um,
2159240	2164200	the idea that at least that's taken off the table, not to put words in your mouth,
2164200	2167960	but this is where I'm trying to find a parallel, like stop me when I diverge.
2167960	2173000	I'm greedy and I want to go to every party. Right. I'm greedy. I want everything,
2173000	2179080	every possible way I can have it. I want both obscurity and also great, great mainstream
2179080	2186040	success. Yes. I want the power that obscurity has, but I want the adulation that mainstream
2186040	2192280	success has. And I find myself bouncing back and forth between those two needs. Always a little
2192280	2196200	bit upset in the middle of those two things. You take the obscurity a little personally,
2197720	2202040	you're not nominated for this or this didn't hit that or this charts as much as you know,
2202040	2205800	as an intellectual person that these, these metrics mean nothing. You know,
2205800	2209880	you're supposed to know that your therapist knows it. You've arrived at all these things.
2209880	2213720	You're, you're a grown man. You get all that stuff, but, and then it gets visceral because
2213720	2217400	you're on Instagram. And then, and then something happens that triggers you. You go,
2217400	2222200	Oh, people don't like me. I'm not approved of, I, I, I, I'm not. And you're like,
2222200	2226680	I don't need, I don't need that goal. I don't need that goal. This is a great opportunity for me to
2226680	2232840	now, uh, not be like now, if you want exact, but if you want insight into the world and how the
2232840	2239000	world must work, look at what I have. And now I metabolize success so fast. And I know this
2239000	2244360	about myself. I can't hold onto it, but I have a lot of it that I could point to if I needed to.
2244360	2249080	I'm sure it's always at work, whether I realize it or not, I'm sure the defense mechanisms of
2249080	2253880	great success are always humming along, even if I can't hear it. And then I say to myself,
2254760	2260440	if I feel this way, if I feel a little beat down today by this, by this thing, imagine how someone
2260440	2267240	who is 22 feels who doesn't have anything to their name, that must make them like a straw house in
2267240	2272360	the wind of that stuff. Because you grow up in an environment where they need the likes and the,
2272360	2277720	and the, yeah, imagine that that my heart breaks for that. Like I did it. I, I did this, uh,
2277720	2284600	I sat in, in the, in the interim between Craig Ferguson and James Corden doing late, late show.
2284600	2291640	I did a guest host thing for three days. I did Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. And I literally
2291640	2299400	cried on Thursday night. I, it made me cry because the question, and this might sort of overlap into
2299400	2306040	television was, and I asked one simple question of the world. Isn't any good? Was I good? That was
2306040	2312840	the question. Was I good? The answer told over Twitter just kept prolonging the, I mean, it just
2312840	2317560	kept prolonging the question. I couldn't find the answer and it drove me crazy. Now you've got the
2317560	2322120	East coast airtime and you've got the West coast airtime. So you do actually two laps around every
2322120	2327960	broadcast. You do the East coast live tweet and you read it and every answer just gets further
2327960	2333720	away from you as you keep reading. And it drove me mad because I couldn't answer the question.
2333720	2340600	Then I realized retroactively, this is what the friends I've had, the girls I've tried to love
2340600	2347800	forever. Like this is what people in this industry have to deal with is this ever escaping answer to
2347800	2354760	this simplest of questions, which is, did anybody like that? Yeah. Yeah. That's the only question.
2354760	2359720	Am I a good primate? Did I do good? Are you ever going to kick me out? Will you just set me up in
2359720	2367400	a branch of this tree where I can chill? I like, I, I, yeah. Like, like, like, because you get early,
2370520	2378680	early encouragement for doing special things. And before you realize that special things are special
2378680	2383800	because they're not normal and you, you, you eventually enter a world where you realize that
2383800	2388120	those special things, they're not that special. You're just, you're just being normal. Like,
2388120	2393080	like they're not that special. They're not so special that you can be an asshole. They're
2393080	2398440	not so special that someone else isn't better at it. They're not so special that it's definitive
2398440	2405960	at all. They're just special enough that your mom says, I love you when you do it. And it might be
2405960	2413240	sewing a fucking seam. It might be your eyesight is better than 2020. It might be jumping over a
2413240	2420200	bush. It might be catching a ball. It, for me, it was reading and writing. I was reading and I was
2420200	2429320	writing and I was reading and I was writing. And like, I, it's like you, you, you start, you just
2429320	2436520	like, like you're swallowing this thread and you're just going along it and you're going, and it's all
2436600	2444360	too late when you go, I don't, I don't want approval anymore. I want safety. I want comfort.
2444360	2451880	And then you look around and go, oh, I don't have as much safety and comfort as someone who,
2452600	2455240	whose mom patted them on the head for being a mailman.
2456760	2460520	Well, I would amend that a little bit for me because I have,
2460520	2464600	by the way, I lost what I was trying to say in the middle and started riffing and I totally,
2465560	2469800	it all fell apart. I tracked it the whole time. That's the scare. You're so bright. You can even.
2469800	2474280	I wasn't fishing for that. John Mayer. You're so bright. You can even articulate stuff. You,
2474280	2478760	you're not even thinking. Don't say my mind is a wonderland. I won't let you say it. I won't have
2478760	2485080	it. I won't have it. You're not an expert on it. And if you say it, it won't be a quote that I can
2485080	2491320	take to my grave. Don't say my mind is a wonderland. I won't, I won't, I won't sing it to you. Okay.
2492200	2498280	But I have, I have, I have fans, I have music fans, you know, and, and, and songs are repeatable.
2498280	2502760	People live inside them forever. So I have that part of it and I feel stable there. However,
2504840	2510600	most of my childhood upbringing, I've decided it's redacted, but part of the way that I got
2510600	2518040	out of Fairfield, Connecticut was by weaponizing my ability to focus on things and write songs
2518040	2524920	and play guitar and get better. Getting better was what I did to defeat monsters. That's how I beat
2524920	2530520	monsters, literally defeated monsters by getting better. I got hit in the arm by the bully. I
2530520	2535800	wouldn't hit back. I would say to myself, you'll see the day you want to buy tickets to my show
2535800	2539960	and I won't let you, right? Of course, to say nothing of the fact that's impossible commercially,
2539960	2545800	but you know what I'm saying. And then you get it. Someone says, you can't do it. And you say,
2546440	2552280	you go silent. You know, I learned how to go deadly silent. I don't act out. I just go deadly
2552280	2558040	silent and then go off in a room and do something. And it works. But now I'm 40. And I think I've
2558040	2564120	driven this pattern into my life where every time I feel lonely, every time I feel like I don't have
2564120	2569640	enough to keep me company, literally to keep me company, I'll just fucking build another,
2569640	2574680	I'll just build another weapon. And the weapon is the music and that's great. But over time,
2574760	2580040	and I think this is where we connect on this is like, nobody tells you when to stop punching.
2581080	2585480	You literally have no concept of what the finish line is because no one really knows what it is.
2585480	2591240	A therapist will tell you, my therapist told me, I'm still catching up to it. She said,
2592920	2600840	you're covered in weapons, you know, and armor. And you know, you're just going to have to let it go.
2600840	2606040	It's not doing anything for anybody. It's there for a fine reason, but you got to let it go. But
2611240	2618120	I get the sense from you that like, I mean, seven Grammys, you're John Mayer.
2619000	2623960	Whatever, man. No, I'm kidding. I'm just gonna get to John, but I understand we're at first name,
2623960	2631560	last name, the like, I correct me if I'm wrong, because this is like, I there's a
2632920	2637400	it sounds like you're at least willing to admit that you're you're scrolling through comments
2637400	2642520	and you're looking for you may not be looking for validation there, but you're like,
2642520	2647080	it's like a ticker. And I'm very curious just in your inner clockwork, like
2647080	2655160	it when someone tries to say someone tries to take a shot at me, they can say you're fat. And
2655160	2662040	I'm like, yeah, I mean, that just means I'm twice as talented as I'd have to be if I was thin.
2662920	2669800	They say you're untalented. And I'm like, it doesn't. Yeah, I want to say to the kids, like,
2669800	2675480	like, that is that is where Batman's chestplate is. Like, you don't like, like, are you kidding me?
2675480	2684520	You heard my name because I like this is what I do. Like, I cannot be killed there. You could you
2684520	2690680	could you could dynamite that chestplate and there wouldn't be a heart behind it to kill. But
2691640	2696600	then there's this but it's like there's other shit that fucks you up. Right. And it's weird
2696600	2701560	because like someone could call you untalented and you could know it and it's like and go like,
2701560	2709080	oh, I don't I'm not worried about being untalented. I'm John Mayer. But I what I'm
2709080	2714440	hearing you say is that there there is shit that it's like because I won't stay still. So
2715080	2721960	because I don't like a unanimous vote. Yeah, I don't like unanimous votes. It took me 40 years
2721960	2728440	to realize I don't like golf claps. I don't like agreed upon 100% approval. For some reason,
2728440	2732600	things go invisible. It's not very punk rock. They just go invisible in my your nightmare is
2732600	2738680	obscurity. It hurts. It hurts to be part of the woodwork like it. My night. My night. I'm not
2738680	2742760	saying you are. I'm saying that's your nightmare obscurity. No, I like obscurity. There's some
2742760	2749240	depth to it. My nightmare is being placed off to the side where everybody goes. Got it. He's
2749240	2755640	indexed labeled bar coded RF labeled. We know who he is. Off you go. That that to me, I can't
2756360	2760600	it. I feel like I disappear. And so what I purposefully have done, I think now I can look
2760600	2766280	back on it with some clarity is diversify so that things can never get that way. I don't know why
2766280	2771720	I do it that way. So the only reason now if I went play the show and came came back, you're right.
2771720	2776600	Nobody could say that I didn't know how to play the guitar. But it's the fact that I'm trying to
2776600	2782440	diversify into situations that are so foreign. Like, how do people feel about me hosting a talk
2782440	2787320	show? You know, I'm going into such enemy territory that I think Chappelle mom. Yeah,
2787320	2793480	the stuff with Dave Chappelle going off and doing a tour with Dave. I, you know, after enough times
2793480	2798280	of getting thrown in jail, you have to say to yourself, there must be something about the
2798280	2802200	clothes in here that I like. There must be something in here that I like. I mean, I'm
2802200	2807400	taking that look at myself at 40. Like, take a look at the patterns. When things go well for you,
2807400	2811880	you tend it's like your hand disappears and you start going, where am I? And you do these things
2811880	2816840	as markers to feel as if you matter in the world because you're trying to Houdini into new stuff.
2816840	2824760	Is it an oversimplification to say, okay, our families, God bless them. They let's not call
2824760	2829240	them good people, bad people. Let's not blame them for anything. They weren't filling the,
2829240	2833960	they weren't paying off the credit card bill. Maybe they gave birth to people with bigger needs
2833960	2839160	that they could fill. But in any case, everybody that I talked to that in our line of work in
2839160	2844280	general, they seem to come back around to their early memories of the parents weren't filling the
2845480	2851240	bucket and then company would come over and all of my friends were the kids that would run out in
2851240	2857400	their pajamas and they would, they would make an ass of themselves and they just loved. It's,
2857400	2861640	is it attention? Is it an oversimplification to say that what you're talking about is that
2862360	2869560	attention is needed. I'll take you one deeper. Distinction. I need distinction.
2869560	2874280	But distinction is defined by strangers or not because it seems like you could be in your garage
2874280	2881240	knowing you're distinct. You're, you have trophies and, and the ego and the self-confidence to know
2881240	2886200	you could sit on a desert island and know that you're better, that you could win a guitar contest.
2886200	2891640	That I always tell people like, when they say, ask about like empirical talent level, I'm like,
2891640	2895800	if I, if this were tennis, I don't know the ranking, but I would definitely beat the open.
2896440	2900520	I know I can, like, that's as far as I can understand it is that I'd be at the US open.
2900520	2904040	I don't know where I'd come in. I don't know if I'd, if I'd place, I don't know if that's tennis.
2904040	2908200	And so you know that. So what's that distinction? That's what you're talking about being distinct.
2908200	2911320	Is that, well, I got it now. I mean, when I was a kid, that's what I wanted. And that's,
2911320	2915480	I mean, the thing about music is I guess the same thing with animating, not trying to like
2915480	2917640	put it in your wheelhouse too much. I know you're not an animator.
2917640	2921400	Well, I'm certainly taking a lot of liberties comparing us so you can do whatever you want.
2923160	2927080	For music, you can, you can hear yourself do the thing. I mean, for me, it came a lot,
2927800	2933000	it resembled very much the sort of alter ego, the superhero thing training in your room. You'll see,
2933000	2939720	I mean, I, I have a great, great, great sense memory of tonight being like everyone's at this
2939720	2946920	party. And I was told maybe there'd be room in the Jetta. So I was, Ryan has a Jetta. And then
2946920	2953080	Ryan said, sorry, I got no more seats in the Jetta. And I'm like, cool, cool. And I know right now
2953080	2957320	that everybody's at the party. And I imagine if I weren't sitting here talking to you, I would be
2957320	2962360	in my bathroom playing a guitar, pretending I was at the party because I like it. There's something
2962360	2969000	about it. I like, I related in the eighties to Teen Wolf differentiation, distinction. He's the
2969000	2977400	only one except for that, you know, for getting into Teen Wolf. I want to be honest to talk and
2977400	2982920	say what I don't quite get. I want to go. I want to go back over that the Jetta metaphor. That
2982920	2988600	didn't happen tonight. You're talking about a memory. I'm saying, yeah, no, but, but, but I'm
2988600	2993960	not a man of distinction this evening. The image of you in the bathroom by yourself when you're
2993960	3001960	not at the party playing guitar. That's an important because I don't know, like, like I can't,
3001960	3007640	you know, maybe you're five years younger than me. So I don't know, like it's a lot of shit can
3007640	3013160	change in a couple of years, but, and I know that I was prolific. I know that I would fucking write
3013160	3021640	for no reason. I remember that, but like I look at musicians because it just looks, you're, you,
3021720	3025880	it involves a piece of lumber and like lessons and things. And like,
3026760	3034200	when you say that you would really do it by yourself, I'm so curious about that because
3034200	3039400	are you searching for something when you do it by yourself? When you, when you, do you, do you plunk
3039400	3045880	out little melodies and like, yeah, you, you do it. I do it to make sure that it's still there.
3045880	3051560	If you could fly, okay, why, why in the comic books, and this is a new thought,
3052120	3058360	is Superman occasionally not just levitating a little bit? If you were Superman, wouldn't you
3058360	3063560	figure out a way to just like, just like a person be like, Superman, can you please not do that? I'm
3063560	3067160	trying to talk to you. Like maybe it's the thing he does when he's bored with a story just goes up
3067160	3074040	a foot and a half. And for me, I feel like if I'm able, if I was told by myself and others that I'm
3074040	3079640	able to perform this act, I'm, I'm, I have a system inside of me that does it. I need to do
3079640	3084680	it every once in a while to see the system at work so I can remember, oh, the reason that I'm
3084680	3088920	in this whole affair is because of that. And that always sort of brings me back. I mean,
3088920	3094120	we're talking about the impetus for an idea, for, for, for doing this with your hand. Pick a note,
3094120	3099880	pick a place. It's total freedom. Play it, hear yourself play it. So you can play it. You can sit
3099880	3103640	down and play guitar from a lot of different angles. Some of it can be like, fuck you. Although
3103640	3108120	I don't do that very often because I'm very blessed, but sometimes, sometimes I get in and
3108120	3112520	I might, if I were sitting in my hotel room tonight, I might've made a little smirk in the
3112520	3116520	mirror and pretended I was at whatever venue the Grammys are at tonight. I don't know, but
3117240	3123080	I think to stay in touch with that is what keeps you healthy and writing great music that you
3123080	3128040	desperately want people to hear, you know? Does doing your music live also sort of keep those
3128040	3134280	demons at bay? Oh yeah. And it taught me how to make records. It's hard to argue with thousands
3134280	3139320	of people. If you're feeling shitty that day, it sort of helps to be doing it live, right? So that's
3139320	3144840	why people stay on tour. They don't like, you know, they don't like traveling. Interesting. I have,
3144840	3149720	and so I'll tell you a little bit about my life. Recently, like I came off tour after a full year
3149720	3155000	of touring and I decided no tour for a minute, no plans for a minute, figure it out, build a life,
3155080	3159640	you know? And 40 didn't freak me out, but it was like, okay, this is a real thing. It's a real
3159640	3165000	benchmark. And so I bought a house. It'll be a while before I move into it, but I got that
3165000	3172040	and I'm living in a hotel. And I realize that I have no life. Now, you could say Tiny Violins,
3172040	3178280	it's a good life, but I have no life outside of touring. If I had a grid on a spiral bound
3178280	3183160	itinerary book, we don't even talk about life in time. We talk about it in place. We say things
3183160	3189720	like that's not until Dallas. There's no time. It's just place. Well, that's not until California,
3189720	3196520	well back in Denver. And so my life only lived inside of that framework and I took it away and
3196520	3203320	I don't have anything to do. And it's freaky. It's hard. And I go, good fight from there,
3203320	3207080	start from there. That's why I'm bumming around the city. That's why I ran into you today. That's
3207080	3211640	why I went, yeah, I'm not doing anything. I took an Uber here. I wish we could help each other,
3211640	3217560	but maybe we could just commiserate. But I think there's a key difference between us,
3217560	3224920	not that I was searching for symmetry, but I think it's important because I'm searching myself,
3224920	3234840	I'm going like, it makes me insecurity here. You talk about being alone and working your craft.
3236440	3241000	I think musicians make me insecure for that reason because that is something they do.
3241800	3249880	The part of a musician's career that I can relate to is the touring part because that is a musician
3249880	3258680	saying, as Dorothy Parker said, I don't like writing. I like having written. And a musician
3258680	3263400	on tour is they're not going to say, thank you ladies and gentlemen for coming to the stadium.
3263400	3269080	I'd like to write a song in front of you. They can have their own religion about the songs they've
3269080	3272120	written and the stuff they want to play from their old album, their new album. But ultimately,
3275160	3281000	that's what I can relate to. I feel like that's how I spend my life. But there's something fucked
3281000	3288520	up about that and I worry about that. I go, fuck, when's the last time you actually tested yourself?
3288520	3294920	When's the last time you sat in a bathroom while the Grammys party was happening? I don't go home
3295000	3304120	and write a story. I play a video game. I watch forensic files. I look at writing as this thing
3304120	3310680	that I do. It's like shitting a fucking egg. I look at that with songwriting. I look at it
3310680	3313880	that way with songwriting. But it's just disembodied guitar playing, I just think,
3313880	3319720	is the greatest thing in the world. But I wonder if I had spent, because how long,
3320600	3324680	I don't know, this is probably a difficult question to answer, but
3326200	3331560	how long does your career really span? How old were you the first time someone said,
3331560	3339320	Jesus Christ, what the fuck? 14. So I feel like if I had spent somewhere around there,
3339320	3343880	somebody said, you're really good at writing essays. You should be on the high school paper
3343960	3352280	or whatever. Somewhere in our lives, somebody says, hey, you could get what you want by what you got.
3357240	3362120	When I talk to musicians, I get insecure because I feel like I don't practice.
3362840	3368040	Well, I don't know that I practice. I think I just check up on it. I mean, you're talking.
3368040	3370520	But you write songs. You talk. You have conversations.
3370520	3373480	You going out and sitting in a coffee shop is practice.
3373480	3375880	You literally just practiced for the last five minutes straight.
3375880	3382040	Well, maybe that's what that's. That's why this, you know, maybe this is that I go in
3382040	3387400	and do it to make sure that it's still there, because if it's not, I have my entire argument
3387400	3395720	for life has failed. Like someone said to me one time, a great lady worked at working publishing.
3395720	3401240	She said to me, John, can you imagine being famous and knowing you're not talented?
3402040	3407960	And I just went, whoa. And I'll never put the fear of God into me. And when things
3407960	3413720	get a little pear shaped or they get or it's not even any more like but I don't think
3413720	3418280	do you think anybody famous knows that they're not talented? Yeah. Those those people would
3418280	3425000	be self actualized. Like I think fame makes you feel really good question. Where is the
3425880	3431480	awareness? Yeah, I mean, well, I if I can't figure it out, you could know it for that.
3431480	3434680	How could an untalented person figure it out? You could know it's for them.
3434680	3441880	If everyone is chanting at you, Donald, Donald, Donald, I riffed a name, you'd be like, well,
3441880	3447480	I must be good at something. I'm good at getting people to shout Donald. I think the entire
3447480	3453320	within nobody else, nobody else that you like, likes you. That's how you know. Yeah. But are
3453320	3458280	we talking about like Smash Mouth or I don't know why I don't I don't have enough musical.
3459000	3463880	You could if you told me Smash Mouth's fucking great. Fuck you. You snob. I'd be like, OK,
3463880	3470520	John Mayer. I but I just felt like like like like like bands that like come in out of nowhere or
3470520	3474760	whatever to keep it in the musical realm like and they're like, oh, my God, they're amazing.
3475560	3480680	They got a hit on the Billboard charts and like we all go or like my music snob friends go.
3480680	3484520	They're not shit. They're not talented. That's three power chords or whatever.
3484520	3490200	Do you think those guys are like they know they're untalented? I don't think they know
3490200	3493320	they're untalented. I think they're like, holy shit, we fucking hit it.
3493320	3496520	We're talking about varying degrees of knowing you're untalented.
3496520	3499560	I think they're all shades of the same thing. By the way, the way your mind works
3500120	3503400	very interesting because it's kind of like a wonderland and you don't need to say it.
3503960	3507560	But I want to I want to give you but if you say it before the end of the show,
3508360	3511240	it'll be a quote. I will. Is there a drinking game going on tonight?
3511240	3514360	No, it's just it's just more of an achievement on my end.
3514360	3515960	Can I do it now? We can get it out of the way.
3515960	3519400	If you look, I didn't fish for it. But if you find it interesting that I could be
3519400	3523400	fish for it at all, you find it interesting that a singer is just like not singing right
3523400	3527960	now and it's just talking like the same in here is the ability to sing at any moment.
3527960	3531000	And I'm not I'm just talking. Have you thought about this before?
3531000	3534200	I've been thinking this whole time. It's pretty weird how he's not singing.
3534200	3537400	You know what I mean? No, but when you're around a singer, you're like,
3537560	3542760	that singing voice is not doing its thing. It's just it's just talking.
3542760	3545800	I guess I hadn't thought about that. Oh, I think about it all the time.
3547560	3550840	Are you are you right now thinking it's weird that you're not singing?
3550840	3554280	Now I think it's well, I think it's weird that I can sing. I'm just not saying yeah.
3556840	3561000	A more naive person would think you were teeing up a kind of musical number.
3561000	3562120	I am. Okay.
3562120	3565240	Because when I do, it'll be fun. You'll be like, that's right.
3565320	3570360	That was in that guy's throat the whole time. Well, what do we do?
3570360	3572360	Do we. So here I am talking.
3572360	3575880	I'm a person who's talking. And at any moment that I want, I can go.
3576440	3581240	Your mind is a wonderland. And then all of a sudden I just start talking again.
3581240	3583560	But you people wouldn't know that you're talking about me.
3583560	3588040	So if I was in the lyrics, see, this is okay. It's a it's a lot of cadence here.
3588040	3589000	Hold on. Yeah.
3589000	3592920	Dan Harmon's mind is a wonderland. You kind of said the Dan Harmon.
3593640	3596360	Dan Harmon's mind is a wonderland.
3596360	3598680	Okay. Well, that's. Yeah. Yeah.
3598680	3601720	You don't have to take notes. Thank you.
3602680	3606920	And I'm talking and I'm singing and I'm talking and I'm singing and talking.
3606920	3607960	Isn't it strange?
3610760	3612280	I think it's kind of strange.
3612280	3615560	It's weird. I could do it at any moment. I just choose not to.
3615560	3617080	It's a little Robert Klein in it.
3617080	3617880	Little Robert Klein.
3618040	3626920	What is the what are the things that hurt you like in terms of this cloud of of people,
3626920	3633080	you know, like I get the sense from you that I don't know I like like like what
3634600	3641240	what are the adjectives that you you wish forget about whether or not you've come to terms with
3641240	3646280	the fact that that you can't control the people. But like what are the adjectives about you that
3646280	3657880	get used that really sting womanizer douchebag, you know, like anything from the past.
3657880	3662360	I find that right now, especially with the ability to consolidate tons of information
3662360	3667000	really quickly. The thing the blind spot is how we deal with past.
3668440	3672040	And I think everyone should be allowed a past as a blanket statement.
3672200	3678120	I'm not defending anything overall, but things as they exist in the past are the
3678920	3684600	are is the sort of that's the gun to my head in the hostage standoff between my happiness
3684600	3689400	and feeling like I got to dig out of a hole. And I find that the Internet is fantastic
3689960	3693320	at compiling a dossier on you that fast with one comment.
3693880	3696760	All it is is someone who just won't let something go or the last
3697000	3702520	big signifying piece of information they had about you was a negative, you know, if I ask,
3702520	3707880	we don't know unless we Google them to find out what their news is, we don't know the goings on
3707880	3713000	of everybody all day. And that's the mistake we make sometimes. So people might not have had
3713000	3721480	an updated take on me since 2010. And I find it so disorienting. I find it such a distortion
3722360	3727720	field of reality when I'm living my life in a way that I know is fair and kind and good
3727720	3735720	and advanced and improved and finally together to have your past sort of brought to you again
3736280	3742680	in what feels like really stark current clarity. You have to really go. That's not true.
3743400	3746920	So you know what I'm saying? Yeah, somebody rehashes it to build their website.
3746920	3750520	Yeah, somebody pulls something up from somewhere somewhere in a comment thing, you know,
3750520	3754440	and you'll go you'll go up and it'll just in the middle of a great thing. Yeah,
3754440	3760200	a great picture and a great thing and having a great moment. And it took me a really long time
3760200	3765560	to get to the point where I can be like, get over it. Not true. Get over it. Grow up. It's not true.
3765560	3772360	But that's how you can get me is show me what feels like a threatening reemergence of my past.
3773240	3777960	And it'll it'll stop me. Although lately I've found a way to just practice looking at it and
3777960	3783000	going long time ago, dude. Come on. Yeah, come on. Let's carry on. Let's like this might be your
3783000	3786280	fault now that you're still bringing this up. This might actually now be on you. You know,
3787000	3792760	I had a thing a couple days ago. Not to embarrass my girlfriend, but
3794440	3798200	you know, she was she was doing something that I haven't done in five years, which is
3798920	3811800	peruse the Harmon town subreddit. And I had this me to surfing expedition recently. I'm
3811800	3818200	giving my master classes and apologies as we speak. But I live I survive whatever.
3820680	3826120	And my girlfriend was like in this subreddit where I haven't gone since way before that,
3826120	3830040	because no matter what, I'm not going to see anything there that's going to make me happy.
3830040	3834280	I got also a million things that might make me happy, but I'll be numb to those things. And
3834280	3840040	then it'll be and then one person will be like, I wonder if I could really fucking block this guy's
3840040	3846920	eye from the from this far. And like, that should be their domain. But the weird thing is and it's
3846920	3855480	like, you think you resolve this shit. And then I had I had this little it was just a little episode
3855480	3862280	because Cody got upset. She she and she sent me a screen grab of an exchange she was having with
3862280	3867800	a troll in that group and it had to do with all the shit. And I got upset with her. And now we're
3867800	3874920	our seam is broken. We're not on the same page. I'm like, and and then I'm expressing to a writer
3874920	3882280	friend of mine who I'm working with in that room. I'm explaining the story to her. I'm like, like,
3882280	3887960	this is happening and it's bad. And like, and that writer Leslie is going, well, I understand
3887960	3891480	where she's coming from, because I did this and that. And I'm telling this is all backstory to
3891480	3897400	this moment that was actually genuinely like weird for me, like in a world where I keep thinking
3897400	3906360	that I've done learning and I just want to die. I like this writer that I respect who's like talking
3906440	3911400	to me. She goes like she goes, well, you know, and look, we all Google ourselves. And I
3912520	3923160	I exploded. I was like, I was like, no, we don't all Google ourselves. I literally cannot Google
3923160	3933640	myself. Do you understand? Do any of you people understand what it's like to be unable to Google
3933640	3943000	yourself? Yes, I do. It's a guilty pleasure for you when you wish you were famous, when you hope,
3943640	3950920	maybe, when you think about how shitty it might be, when you get to the point where you are choking
3950920	3960040	on your own name, when you don't want to see your own face, like I do not Google myself and have not
3960600	3966760	stopped putting me in that drawer. And I wound down like, oh, shit, I got unresolved.
3966760	3970200	That's like when somebody accused you of masturbating as a kid and you really weren't.
3971080	3978280	Yeah, like, yeah, like, yes, especially. Yes, John. Yeah, yeah. That's my entire childhood.
3978280	3983800	I jerked off so many times when no one said anything and then I spent too long doing my
3983800	3988600	own laundry and I come upstairs and my mom goes reading, please play my magazines much. Stop,
3988680	3992760	get out of my pants. I was drying my clothes. Exactly what it is. You want to know when I
3992760	3999960	jerked off? It was right behind you. Yep. Yep. Right behind. But yeah, I can't know. But it was
3999960	4007720	like the weird thing is that I just jumped on this woman because she was accidentally confusing me
4008280	4016120	with someone who Googled themselves. I quit Googling myself. I think a lot of celebrities
4016360	4019640	quit Googling themselves. It doesn't offer any really good information. It gives you a really
4019640	4024840	bad cross section of what's happening. It's like you're not really pulling out what's really in
4024840	4028760	the river. It's only the money making headlines. Yeah, it's weird. That's what the fuck the river
4028760	4032840	is though. Well, now that's what I want to make sure we talk about before whenever this thing is
4032840	4037800	over is over. You made it sound a little bit like you're not enjoying your... No, I am. But
4039400	4043880	so what I do now is I haven't Googled myself in like three, four years. But when I told you this
4043880	4049320	today, when I want to see something specific, a certain guitar that I'm coming out with or
4049320	4053720	something, I'll put the name of the guitar in first, and then my name, because I can't even
4053720	4061320	bear to watch the autofill hat. Yeah, yeah. So and if I do, I just go... Because I can't see
4061320	4064760	what comes up like that. It might be one of the words that I've mentioned. I don't know if I've
4064760	4068840	shaken the Chevy Chase syphilis from my autofill or not. I don't know. Well, that's... Because I
4068840	4073640	won't look. I'll just... I will literally... People think I'm joking. I'll close my eyes if there's
4073640	4078520	some reason for me to type Dan. Because this goes back to the past thing. Until I finish typing.
4078520	4085080	What should fucking happen online is that every year, everything that had ever been posted to
4085080	4092760	the internet that is not sort of textual in a reference sense should blur. Every year, it should
4092760	4099640	blur 10%. So that when you see an old story, when you see someone's old point of view, you can go,
4099640	4103240	yeah, but it was pretty blurry. I couldn't make most of it out. Because that's what happens in
4103240	4107960	people's minds, in their hearts. Things blur over time. Yeah, and I feel compelled to stop here and
4107960	4113240	go, by the way. That's what it's like, because I just... We're not complaining. We're not saying
4113240	4120040	what was me. We're not... We're talking about an island that you don't even know if you're listening,
4120840	4129480	whether or not you want to get there. And I never signed up for a... I guess I always just thought,
4129480	4135800	the more attention you get, the better. The more Myspace friends you have, the better. Every metric
4135800	4142440	is just like, well, you want more and not less. I want to go back in time and go, no, I'm artisanal.
4144280	4149880	I want to squeeze it off and go, don't know me. I don't want strangers to know my name.
4149880	4155720	Well, I do. And I think it's important to square up with that. And I think it's also important for
4155720	4161240	anybody watching who's a fan of either of ours. I think the one thing we haven't laid out is,
4161240	4166840	to what extent do we wrestle with this every day? We haven't really given people a context
4166840	4171000	as to what fraction of our lives do we deal with this. This is a very small... I want to say that I
4171000	4177960	am magnifying a very small experience. It's 15% of the experience, and most of it I almost want
4177960	4183560	to say to the world, don't worry, I'll handle it. And it's really handleable. What I find
4183560	4193400	is interesting and universal is how much we hand off to this voracious, invisible
4194200	4199960	boa constrictor that just keeps consuming our thoughts that don't have a purpose. Waking up,
4199960	4204680	I know you do the same thing. You wake up and you read Twitter, and something seems to you to be so
4205240	4212120	cognitively wrong. Not a bad opinion, not a bad idea, but cognitively empirically wrong.
4212120	4216760	And you stare at the blinds until it's seared into your eyes, the slats of light. You haven't
4216760	4223720	even gotten a coffee yet. And you're already trying to go... You're going, fuck. And you're
4223720	4229640	trying to get out the knot in the necklace that is this whole thing. And the question is,
4229640	4236520	how much are you willing to trade of your life to do that, which seemingly has no real actionable
4237320	4243480	outcome, versus I'm just going to live a life to scale so that I can at least enjoy some of this
4243480	4248520	stuff. That's certainly what I've started. I came off Twitter, I got to enjoy my life. I feel like
4248520	4253960	what Twitter is trying to do right now are basically like full court trick shots instead
4253960	4260280	of just like, let's just work off of basketball fundamentals. And every day is a failure to throw
4260280	4265480	the ball off like the McDonald's commercial. And it's like, well, we'll get him again tomorrow.
4265480	4271960	That's really interesting. And I go, why can't you piece this out? And the answer is because
4271960	4278200	there's too many. It's like, why can't you leave single file in an arena if someone screams fire?
4278200	4283800	Right. Because there's chaos. But you could get everybody out like that. If you just went row one,
4283800	4289160	you're out. Row two, row three. And so every day I watch the pile on and I go, no, no, no, no. And
4289160	4297800	it's for things I'm allied with. But I watch the course in which it takes and I watch it every day.
4297800	4302120	Every day you wake up, it's a possibility that we might get it. And within seconds you find out,
4302120	4306600	nah. And you find out there's people getting trampled. The only thing that nags at me is how
4306600	4312760	do we know the difference between getting over 40 and realizing that self-care is important and
4312760	4316120	becoming old men saying, get off my lawn. I don't understand why the kids spend all their
4316120	4323000	time online. I think the word that we're trying to get at is fatigue. There is fatigue with each
4323000	4327160	cycle, with each cycle. The difference is whether you're outputting. The difference is whether we
4327160	4332120	go into our bathrooms and play guitar and put stuff out. Because if you say, get off Twitter,
4332120	4337640	kids, or I'm not on Twitter, do whatever the fuck you want. And you put out a single every month or
4337640	4344200	whatever. It's like if you're exuding shit and people that are on Twitter are not exuding shit,
4344200	4349320	except for tweets, that's the answer to my question. But I'll take you even deeper on fatigue.
4349320	4352120	Let's go back to the play guitar in the bathroom thing. There's fatigue in that.
4353560	4364040	40 is not about some celebration of ordaining how long, how many years you've been alive for. It's
4364040	4369080	how long you've been doing, how your memory begins to the memory of being alive, the access
4369080	4374360	you have. There's a certain fatigue where occasionally I'll say to myself, just about
4374360	4380120	life in general, we still doing this? You ever find yourself, you go, will you still add this?
4381080	4386120	And it's not like we want to end this at all. You just go, will you still add this? And the answer
4386120	4392760	is yep. And you go, okay. Yeah. It's like you see all the days line up and you're like, yeah,
4392840	4400760	I'm at 60,000 of 140,000. Just checking in. But you don't, you don't even have to look at it
4400760	4405160	in that numerical way. You can just feel it. Yeah. You know, you can kind of count cards without
4405160	4409880	really counting cards for sure. You just kind of feel it. It's like, we still have to, okay,
4409880	4414600	what am I about to do? Go make another record. Yeah. Okay. So we're going to fight from scratch
4414600	4419240	to have, yep. Okay. And we're going to come home three out of four times with nothing,
4419240	4423160	with an empty net. We're going to have to live off of something else that night. Yep. Yeah.
4423160	4429000	We're still at this. Yep. Why? Because it's gotta be that way. Because otherwise we won't sleep
4429000	4435080	tonight. We can't, it won't work. Like I have to risk everything. I have to have everyone hate me.
4435080	4442440	I have to do it. I have to prove something to myself. Yeah. And where I think it gets really
4442440	4452280	tricky is in relationship and family, getting a wife, getting a girlfriend, that takes a certain
4454280	4461240	determination that might not exist in my life like it should anymore. Because my determination is
4461240	4468040	taking a natural dip. Testosterone, determination. It starts to just go down a little bit. Old jazz
4468040	4472600	horn players don't play as long a line. That's true. And vocalists do the same thing. Vocalists,
4472600	4477400	they don't sing as like, oh, you guys used to burn on the saxophone with bop lines for four minutes
4477400	4485720	to go, and everyone loves them. And everyone goes, that's the guy who used to burn. And I used to
4485720	4489480	burn and I'm trying to still burn. I think I've got two more burning things in me. That's why I
4489480	4492680	want to make sure I do on my next break. I feel like I have one more burn. You have one more way
4492680	4497400	to burn. You motherfuckers wish. You know we don't get to say that. You wish. We don't get to say
4497400	4502760	that. You know, we wish we had like one or two burns. But the truth is, the universe, whoever gave
4502760	4507800	us the shit is going to tell us when we get to stop burning. You're going to find out mid-fail burn.
4507800	4515320	How many burns you got? Yeah. That's my daughter. That's my first daughter's name. Mid-fail burn.
4517160	4522920	I wish I could retire. We don't get to, you know the deal. Yeah. You're going to be six burns in.
4523000	4526680	Yeah. I just mean like, and I agree. I'm not saying that's not what you're saying,
4526680	4532680	but I'll always be making records. But like burning things, like you listen to like 21 pilots,
4532680	4538200	that shit is burning. That's a 21, 22 year old kid who's got so many syllables. When you're young,
4538200	4544520	you got syllables. Sometimes I think too much. And I had those thoughts. I wish somebody could
4544520	4548120	bottle a smell. And they're like, I had those thoughts. I went that close to the wallpaper.
4548120	4552840	The kids that we send to war and convinced to, yeah. Dark as fuck, Dan.
4555320	4561080	Their brains are on fire. And we go, yeah, fuck you. Like you're a child that you need to be.
4561080	4564680	But I did it. I went from, welcome to the real world. She said to me, condescendingly,
4564680	4568520	take a seat, take your life, flat it out. And we're not even halfway through the verse,
4568520	4572280	not even halfway through the first. That's what happens when you're younger. You burn,
4572280	4575480	you want to go out, you want to drink. Hi, my name is. Hi, my name is John. Hi, my name is John.
4575480	4579320	And then you hopefully through those actions and you dial them in enough and get enough focus,
4579320	4584760	you go, oh, at the end of that nitro burn, I ended up with a wonderful wife, three kids,
4584760	4589240	I got a house, I got a career. I got to think the stages through which my career,
4589240	4593800	the booster rocket worked and the way it burned and stick with this burn metaphor till it dies out
4594840	4598840	is that I have incredible career. I have an incredible mindset.
4598840	4601640	I got to where I needed to get to. And I went, oh, there's nobody.
4602280	4608600	I forgot to pick someone up, you know, and then add to that the trauma that everybody feels
4608600	4612600	through the way that they live through their 20s for dating and 30s for dating. And I have that
4612600	4618360	times 100 because I chose in many ways without knowing it to do that in a very visible way
4619080	4623720	that in a way my brain is just fried from it. You know, that's the part that scares me.
4623720	4628040	Everything else is a joyride. The part that scares me is that like, I might have missed
4628040	4631960	the boat and in which case it would still be cool because I would just be like rich uncle
4631960	4636600	John. You could come to his island and a drone comes out to get you first. And you're like,
4636600	4639720	you start running after the drone. You see the drone first, like war games.
4639720	4642920	You're running after the drone? Remember war games when they're going to see Joshua?
4642920	4647880	Yeah, there's a helicopter came, but that was pre-drone. But do you, uh, if you just like that
4647880	4652360	your drone, you have to run after it because you're, that's how fancy they would get off the boat.
4652360	4655880	John Mayer's drone. It doesn't come hunting you. You have to chase it.
4655880	4658680	I'm trying to make a good impression on my niece who I haven't seen. And she's seven
4658680	4662120	probably. Like I wouldn't have seen my niece in like seven years and I'll give her the drone.
4662120	4665560	It's going to be hers. If you chase the drone and catch it,
4665560	4670760	you can keep a John Mayer drone. The John Mayer drone will go. Your mind is
4672440	4678840	now I'm doing an impression of people doing the white noise, just all white.
4678840	4682280	Let's name my next album. We hear that you are a Rick and Morty fan. Is that true?
4682280	4686040	Huge Rick and Morty fan. I'm such a big fan of Rick and Morty that as I watch it,
4686040	4689880	I lament the minutes I've already watched it for. Do you know what I mean?
4689880	4697080	Yeah. What's the, uh, well, I mean, that seemed like a segue. We could talk about Rick and Morty,
4697080	4700840	but I actually, I don't know. I wanted to hear, like I asked you, you said,
4701720	4708120	douchebag and womanizer. These are things that, that, that sting, which I look at as like with,
4708120	4714840	I'm just like marveling. I'm like, must be nice to have being called a womanizer. Uh,
4714840	4720520	your kryptonite. I like, maybe it's because when you talk, I want to fuck your brains out. But,
4720520	4727000	but, uh, I always tell people, if you think that I thought that I was good looking growing up,
4727000	4731560	why do you think I would have played guitar six hours a day? There's my,
4731560	4736200	there's your answer. I played guitar six hours a day. If I had any inclination or belief in myself
4736200	4739720	that I was good looking, I'm sure I don't have the will to have done that. What are the things
4739720	4743560	you like to hear? What are the things you wish to hear? Or when you hear them that it's like
4743560	4747800	fucking, like even secretly, like, you're just like, God damn it. I love hearing that. I like
4747800	4753480	when people say like, you're my Clapton. I like, cause I can use that. That's a good clean linear
4753480	4758520	line item way to be like, that's what's going on. Cause you do want proof that you're living your
4758520	4762680	life in the format of your dreams as a kid. What does that mean to you? You're my Clapton.
4763240	4767960	It means everything I tried to be, I got to it because I tried to be your Clapton.
4767960	4769400	Well, cause what was Clapton to you?
4770200	4777720	An incredible mix of blues guitar and mainstream music, which not to get super technical, but
4777720	4784280	blues music isn't really an idiom of music. It's a style of writing. It's a, it's a, it's a,
4784280	4789640	it's a compositional form, you know, and there's not a lot of money in blues. There's not a lot
4789640	4796040	of audience in blues. And it's part of me thinks it's because blues needs to be mixed with another
4796040	4800680	compound to come to life. And you could say for everybody who came around, they kind of,
4800680	4804680	they kind of were, they mixed. Am I right in saying Stevie Ray Vaughan sort of did the same
4804680	4808120	thing? Yeah, Stevie Ray Vaughan did the same thing. Jimi Hendrix did the same thing, you know.
4809080	4817800	And Clapton is, is the guy who fused really incredibly prestigious blues playing
4818440	4823000	with pop music. And that's incredibly hard to do to get the, to get this, you know,
4823000	4827480	to get those two organisms to live together and not reject each other and just turn into a blob
4827480	4832360	and a Petri dish. Like it's really hard, like nine out of 10 attempts to do it. You just end up with
4832360	4838920	nothing. So, I mean, that's, that's a, that guy stands in his own universe, you know, it's not.
4838920	4843880	It's in the way that you use it. Let me ask you a question. Do you think that's a cool song?
4844760	4849880	I think it's a funny song. I, the thing I think is funny about it is that it's,
4849880	4855560	it's the only song I've ever heard that starts mid-refrain. Yeah. It's really funny that that
4855560	4863320	song just goes. Normally a song like that should start with, sometimes you use things,
4866360	4873080	sometimes the way. That was a big eighties trick though. And then you build and build to build.
4873560	4877080	And you're waiting for him to go. But he was just like, like, I just think it's funny that
4877080	4883720	the needle drops on that record. It's like, two, three, it's in the way that you use it. Fuck it.
4883720	4887240	And then they, and then they eventually come around to proving that that was the refrain.
4887240	4891960	It's like, that's not the verse. So it's the refrain that came from eighties producer mindset,
4891960	4896200	which was like, gotta hit him with the hook. There's no time, no time for this. No time.
4896200	4901400	These kids are going to buy a Pokemon instead of your record. If you give them five measures,
4901400	4905400	that's the way it is now. I mean, you gotta, you gotta hit him with the mixtape in one song,
4905960	4911880	one don't pick up the phone. You know, he's only wanted a highway cone too. Don't poop in your
4911880	4918120	shoe. I got the rules to tell you three. This is the whole record in one song. I don't know.
4918120	4922680	I was just thinking of like, you gotta get like that, that, that song reminds me of a buzzfeed
4922680	4930600	article. Oh, it's like a listicle song. Yeah. Oh, it's got a diving in an airplane. Yeah.
4930600	4934120	That country has that a lot. Here's six ways to lose weight by Friday.
4934840	4941240	Yeah. Like I would make it up and it'd be like, I went skydiving. I went mountain climbing.
4941240	4949000	I walked 50,000 miles across the land. We're only halfway through. I swam across the river.
4949000	4955080	I walked across the gator, but there's one thing that I'll never understand. And then I completely
4955080	4961160	different word, like phrase that just like lands, like, like unbalanced into the title.
4961880	4968600	Well, I don't know why you're not a bun for my hot dog. That's right. Yeah. And you're like,
4968600	4974920	wait, what, why would you climb a mountain? How do we get there? Well, this was just misdirection.
4977080	4981160	And at the last line, it's like, but I'm, but check your back pocket. That's right.
4981160	4989320	I got your wallet. Who's taking your wallet? I'll mix your metaphors, darling. I'll mix them
4989320	4996520	better. I wrote, uh, I wrote a line one time. It was just, I couldn't handle it. I wouldn't
4996520	5002200	put it. You're like a metaphor. I've never heard before. And I went, that's so cyclical because no
5002200	5007080	one really has heard that metaphor before. And if you wondered, does John Mayer have a theoretical
5007080	5011880	limit to how poetic somebody can be? Yes. That will never make the case. There it is. Yeah.
5011880	5016360	I thought, I thought in, in, in, in your body's in Wonderland, I know it's like, Oh, it's your,
5016360	5021560	it's your hit. And you're not like, Oh, it's also a most proud of it. But I did think the,
5021560	5027000	the verse where you compare, you, when you say your nipples are like, uh, Epcot center, it was,
5028120	5031640	I pushed it. I said, I think you're pushing the metaphor. Yeah. It's like, you didn't have
5031640	5038040	to go through every part of the body and, and, and compare it to a theme park. Uh, your toes
5038040	5042520	are like a long, a quick pass. Yeah. Your toes are like little, little, little shrimp. And then,
5042520	5047160	and then I said, you have a langoustine pinky toe. I just, I just, if you love a woman,
5047160	5050200	just tell her you love her. A lot of times that's good enough. When you
5051400	5054840	never won't, that was a direct response to your body as a word.
5056680	5061560	Brian Adams wrote, when you really love a woman as a way to tell me to shut the fuck up in your
5061560	5070760	body. You don't have to write a cheesy song about how body parts are like, right? Because when you
5070760	5081720	find yourself lying helpless, you know, you don't need a stupid song. And you are vaginas like the
5081720	5087400	haunted hotel before they were using it to advertise the Eddie Murphy movie.
5087400	5095400	Your vagina is the classic version of that. I've got a fast pass to your titties.
5097160	5104360	So I'm going to eat at your Naval restaurant. You had that cadence. Take a fast pass to your titties.
5104920	5111480	It was very Western. I took a fast pass to your titties. I'm curious about slowbo. I'm curious
5111480	5120440	about singing because, well, so people just have pipes, right? So is that genetic? Yeah. And it
5120440	5126040	actually is, as I get older, now I realize I can't take it personally. If someone says I can't sing
5126040	5130520	or I go like, this is the shape my voice is in. I literally can't change it. Whatever my
5131160	5137240	pharynx is, whatever the larynx is, it's a shape and it's like a shape of a wind instrument. So
5137800	5142680	I'm very good at singing low and I'm very bad at singing high. In fact, worse than ever,
5142680	5150040	because I had some vocal issues. You had surgery. Yeah. It's kind of awesome. Thank you. I looked
5150040	5153880	at it like Kobe would look at it, which is like, yeah, if you need to go into the knee, go into the
5153880	5159560	knee. If I can't play a season, I want a championship next year. So go into the knee this year. And so
5159560	5163560	would you have continued just to, would you have just continued to play guitar that had gone down?
5163560	5166680	Yeah. But I got to tell you, I learned how much I love singing because I did do that and they're
5166680	5170840	linked. I didn't think they were linked. That's like once I got my voice back, I was like, okay,
5171400	5178040	with what I have, which is still mostly capable. When people who can sing are singing as a person
5178040	5183000	who cannot sing and who occasionally then sings like in karaoke, like the rest of us,
5183000	5187080	and you have these moments where you're like, oh, you're listening to yourself and you go,
5187080	5193240	oh, I sound a little bit like George Michael for that one moment. Like when people who can sing,
5193560	5198280	do you, is there dread? If you're in front of a stadium and you're singing,
5199080	5205160	do you, is every note like an evil can evil jump or are you just like, nah, I got this.
5206200	5212760	Some are when, okay. So when I feel like I have, I've well slept, I have some refluxes in check. I
5212760	5219400	sleep on a medicated pillow, prescription pillow. It's on a slant. I sleep on my side. I hide it
5219480	5222440	when company comes over, but most of the time I use it.
5223960	5229640	That's like the sexiness of John Mayer atmosphere. The medicated pillow just bounces off.
5229640	5234280	Sorry, I have a prescription pillow, but then you could also see like, because I'm a singer.
5235640	5243000	But when I know that the facility is there, it's really, really fun. But singers are a notoriously
5243720	5250840	sensitive, hyper-focused neurotic bunch because the voice is never the same way two days in a row.
5250840	5255720	It's my voice has never been the same way two days, any two days. It's just a natural thing.
5255720	5260200	Your voice changes. There are things you could go for on the record that don't sound the same
5260200	5264760	live. And that's another thing I've come to live with over the years. But when you're young and
5264760	5270280	it's the showcase and you're in LA, let me tell you this. When you're in LA for your showcase,
5270360	5274760	you're starting out, you're playing the club, you will get sick. You just will. You just will get
5274760	5279320	sick. You'll wake up that day and go, and you live with that. And you go crazy for the day.
5279320	5284120	You take prednisone. Every singer has prednisone stashed away. Every singer dopes in that sense.
5284120	5286840	And it's because there are horror stories.
5286840	5287240	It's up here.
5290440	5297400	Do you experience these moments? What's the worst case scenario? Because from the layman's perspective,
5297400	5302840	all we understand is it's like the rock star game where there's eight notes and you hit the
5302840	5309800	note right. And then you professionals are like, oh, no, it's all this other shit. But we look at
5309800	5316600	it like, oh, Madonna canceled her gig. Sorry, I'm dating myself. She canceled her gig. She's
5316600	5321720	got a sore throat. OK, well, that's the big gig. But to me, the nightmare wouldn't be canceling
5321720	5327480	a gig. It would be. Is there this nightmare is canceling the gig because you just stare
5327480	5331800	at your hotel. Have you ever been in front of a bunch of people and been like, your body is.
5333080	5339080	Yes. But I've learned that they really most of the time can't tell. And you interpret, right?
5339080	5344120	Most of the time they get to 98 percent of the time. So that's my next question. Like what it's
5344120	5350520	not. So it's not just this empirical thing because your voice, I can hear it even though I don't even
5350520	5357320	like music. I'm like, I get it. You get it. I know why your voice is special. I can hear it.
5357320	5362360	Like are you listening to different shit and you're going shit. I lost five percent of the
5362360	5368920	mere sound. So this is the difference between having a good performance and giving a good
5368920	5372840	performance. You can give a good performance, which means you like that you like that you
5372840	5377640	liked it. But I didn't have a good performance. And having a good performance is in the user
5377640	5382920	experience of how it feels to have the automat arm go for the note, pull it, have the muscles
5382920	5387240	go like that, have the air pushed through the right way, have the microphone turned up loud enough
5387240	5390680	and the monitors in the right way and the thing bouncing around the sound waves bouncing around
5390680	5394680	the room the right way. And they come back to you in a way that says you are God. And it feels good.
5394680	5399960	That's what I wanted to know because the like actually that's how normal people feel to when
5399960	5404280	they accidentally hit a note. That's why we say what you're saying because the shower makes us
5404360	5409080	feel like that. Do you think that every normal person to use your parlance, do you think
5409080	5414760	that every one of them has one like pet favorite line from a song and sing that they picked up in
5414760	5422920	the shower because it's my crew that loves world is a wonderful world of cameras. Yeah. Sorry. I
5424360	5429240	it's a it's a commercial from Milwaukee. No, it's but it's it's more importantly the
5429240	5433240	but yes, the answer to your question is yes. Like people like you have one. Is there a song like a
5433240	5438360	little line you go, I still got it on that. Yeah. If I can hit any like this is dating myself,
5438360	5444680	but any Philip Bailey. Yeah. My Michael McDonald is falling apart as I get older and older,
5444680	5449000	but so did his. Right. Right. Right. Right. I'll just learn to sing how he sings now.
5449000	5453560	I love those. I love I can listen to Easy Lover all the time. Yeah. Yeah. That's why we get along
5453560	5457160	because I'm a Phil Collins guy. We didn't have a different song. Easy Lover together. It's such
5457160	5466520	the drummer's mix of that song because it's too, you know, dueling drum. Yeah. So you were like,
5466520	5469720	it's oh, they had to agree on this track. It's they really had to love this track because it
5469720	5474520	starts out with big drums. Actually, that also starts out with Easy Lover. Yeah. Oh,
5474520	5479400	you're right. You're absolutely right. It starts with the fucking thing was like you got it.
5479400	5481880	Got to hit him. Got to hit him with it. Got to hit him with the horse.
5482760	5487480	Give me a hit. But I thought actually to myself, there's a real, the sign of an amazingly good
5487480	5493800	song is when I hear it and I wonder what it must have been like the night the artist finished it
5493800	5498120	and sat back and played it for the manager. And imagine being like, Joel, come here,
5498120	5507160	Joel, sit down, press play. And you hear do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, and Joel's
5507160	5512920	like, I like it. Like, shut up, Joel. Hold on. Do, do, do, do, do, do, do. You're like, easy.
5516360	5521320	Yep. Like, that's a victorious moment. Yeah. I love the producer nod. That's like,
5522040	5526040	this is a magic in every like documentary where like they just knew it right.
5526040	5529000	But I kind of think that, yeah, but it's interesting to note that like,
5530040	5536680	you feel the same feeling that my uncle feels in the shower. Like there are the it's just the
5538120	5544280	when you're feeling it, it's more in line with a bunch of people hearing it, but we all feel it
5544280	5549720	when we like, like that sensation of fuck, I'm nailing it. And it's like, it's weird to me as
5549720	5553880	a person who doesn't understand anything about music or singing. Like what? Yeah. What is that?
5553880	5558920	But it doesn't last very long as a guitar player, anybody who picks up guitar can feel the same way
5558920	5563960	I feel. It's so scalable. It's the same feeling. That's what, that's what makes it a magic thing.
5563960	5568360	Like you take it home and you learn fire and rain. I promise you, it has the same
5569400	5575640	experiential bliss that my writing gravity does. I'm sure of it. But just imagine being like,
5575640	5583080	hey, Dan, can I play you something? Check this out here. Have a seat. I was born by the river.
5583080	5591000	Like the moment in a little and the strings. Yeah. Just like that. And I'm watching to make
5591000	5596520	sure you don't get on your phone. Ever since gonna be alone. That's the first time anybody's
5596520	5604280	heard it. Long time coming and I know he likes it. And then like some guy goes,
5605880	5611320	do the strings have to start from the beginning? Bobby, I told you to put tambourine in it.
5613160	5617080	Bobby, I told you to put tambourine. I told you, you're not going to hook up the recorder.
5617160	5621160	I told you my daughter played recorder. You know, this is for Colgate records. They want it minty.
5623640	5625000	This doesn't feel minty.
5629320	5633320	You're going to say river. You're going to say field. You was born by a field, Bobby.
5634760	5639720	I miss the days where the lead singer would talk to the drummer. Hey, what you gonna play now?
5640760	5646440	Have you ever seen the thing on YouTube, the young lady singing the jingles in the 80s for
5646440	5655960	the bread company? It's Patty Patty cake, Patty cakes, Patty cakes. It's like 40 minutes of her
5655960	5662920	doing takes on this jingle. And it's the, it's just, it's your heart goes out to her and she's
5662920	5667640	just like, she's in this sweater and it's the eighties and it's VHS. And she's just in this
5667640	5671320	booth and just like, it's just over and over again, endless takes. And she's like, uh-huh.
5671320	5681160	Okay. All right. Sorry. Yeah. Patty cakes, Patty cakes. Because clearly what they're saying is like,
5681160	5688920	give it more bread. She's not singing about something she feels anything about, but she's
5688920	5694840	trying. And then you just watch her like reaching for it. It's like, Patty, you know that Patty cakes
5694840	5700120	are my bread. And then, and then like she keeps getting cut off so many times you never get to
5700120	5705000	the, I guess you'd call it a bridge, but it's a jingle. But, and that's the amazing part. It's
5705000	5710920	like 20 minutes into this reel. You get, she finally gets all the way to the point where
5710920	5716440	you get to hear the rest of the song. And it's like a bridge. And she's like, cause it's good,
5716440	5729000	bread bread bread bread. Like that's, that's the, that's the, the, the Valhalla. You get to,
5729000	5735000	if you jump through all those hoops, you get to sing it's good bread. I just, poor woman,
5735000	5740920	like who was born with the voice of God, everyone's got like the creatives are given this gift.
5740920	5746520	And then they're like, they're, they're just putting these actual glass boxes. Like,
5746520	5753400	can you give us a little more raisin on the raisin? Cause it's raisin bread. It's amazing.
5753400	5758120	It's just like the realism of like hearing a little bit of what she hears on the track
5758120	5760440	through her earphones. Just like a little bit. You just hear the music.
5760440	5764200	Is this for that little bit through her, through her headphones?
5773000	5776920	I imagine that someone like you probably has lived his whole career,
5776920	5786360	like wondering when do I get an opportunity to sing like the improvised hook for an improvised rap
5787000	5795560	about just anything. Like, like, when do I get to really let loose and just be John Mayer on the
5796440	5803560	Dan Harmon rap? Well, I'm, I believe now that the way that I can speak to my abilities
5803560	5812120	without sounding arrogant is to speak to my potential. I believe that I am a man of infinite
5812120	5816200	potential. I believe that my potential is far greater than anyone else's potential.
5817160	5823480	And I believe that. So I don't even know what I'm capable of. I am also just discovering every
5823480	5829000	day I wake up, if I choose to, I can put my hand in a goldfish. I feel the same way about something
5829000	5835960	new, something I didn't know that I could do. This is a super, I think you caught me on the same
5835960	5841720	night. I'm feeling the same way. I don't know if I can rap. And one might say,
5842360	5848120	that anything that's come to me that has been deleterious in any way has come because of my
5848120	5854440	belief in my potential. Yes. Holy shit. It has all just been infinite potential. And this is why
5854440	5858920	I feel like I get flattened out in two dimensional when things go my way, because I lose the sight
5858920	5864440	of my potential because my potential is realized and I don't feel at home there. So whatever song
5864440	5871320	you have, Dan Harmon, I want you to believe that I'm going to drop into it with vigor and dedication,
5871400	5876360	like it was my patty cakes. Let us bring this vigor. Give me a beat.
5879560	5891640	Don't give me time to think about it. Oh, shit. Yo. Yo. Rap isn't about thinking. It's
5891640	5896120	a Titanic. It's not about sinking. It's about floating on the ocean with water.
5896120	5901240	Rap is going from mothers to daughters. The patriarchy has got to come down. I fucked your
5901240	5905720	mama so hard, I turned her smile upside down. But that doesn't mean she started frowning. It just
5905720	5911400	means happiness was inverted for her. Yo. My name is Dan Harmon. I'm here to say that I'm here to
5911400	5917800	say things in a rapping way. I like to rap west and rap to the east. I fucked your mama like a
5917800	5923720	beast. But let's talk about the earth and horizons. I fucked your mama and it was surprising. I'm not
5923720	5931640	trying to use the fuck your mama crutch. I'm not Starsky or Hutch. I'm rapping for real. From the
5931640	5938760	top of my head, John Mayer's here to help me. I'm going to respect his involvement and not be
5938760	5945400	hacked. I'm going to flow from my head down to my heart and rap instead in a real way and rap
5945400	5951640	from the soul and do it like rock and roll. I'm going to rap like a stream, rap like a mountain.
5951720	5957080	I fucked your mama like she was a fountain. Okay, stop. Don't stop. I didn't mean you stop. I'm
5957080	5965720	rapping. Take it. Don't you know it's now or never. We can't do it all so clever. We gotta do it
5965720	5974600	together. We gotta do it together. Don't you know it's now or never. All we got to be is clever.
5974680	5981560	And don't you know we got to do it together. All we got to get together. Birds from a feather.
5981560	5986920	They flock together depending on the weather. When it's warm out, they go down to Miami and
5986920	5994840	they fuck your mama like Sammy, a friend of mine. All right, just give me a chance. Okay. All right,
5994840	6001800	give me a chance. Just give me a second. We're okay to fail here. Rap. Rap. You know, it's now or
6001880	6009240	never. Tell your mama check the weather. Exactly. Whatever we do is clever. Yeah. When we all get
6009240	6016840	together. Yeah. When we rap, we join together and then we clap. Yeah. And then we do it together.
6016840	6025720	And then we're friends. And then we're friends. Yo, when I went, I'm rapping. Bumble. Yeah. No,
6025720	6034680	it's fine. Yeah, we keep rapping. Foot and a shoe. I fucked your mama and shot my glue.
6035480	6041400	I put it on her envelope and then we went off and got married. We eloped. I proposed to her and she
6041400	6047960	said yes. And then we went and met Herman Hess. He was a Nazi war criminal, but he was fine. He's not
6047960	6054920	a good person, but he allowed us to dine in his living room. And he gave us some, some, some, some
6054920	6060200	shrooms. And we went in the backyard and we looked at our hands and they looked like cosmic shards
6060200	6064920	and they were reflecting the moonlight. And we said, holy shit, humanity is united like cloves
6064920	6071480	of bread. Oh shit. We're all yeast and we're rising up to the west of the east. And then
6071480	6079000	Harmon is your daddy. Now he's been here with your mother and he likes to tell the world about it.
6079000	6086680	There's no harm and harm. Yeah. Don't you know that there's no harm and harm and he and your
6086680	6094840	daddy. He could have broken the news. Maybe a little better, but what better time than a freestyle
6094840	6101320	line to let you know that he'll be coming home to put you in your place via your mama's
6101320	6107160	face. Yeah. Dan Harmon. Yeah. There's no harm and harm and I should give you two different
6107160	6111720	hooks to choose from in the mix. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we're not going to edit it. Yo, here's
6111720	6117320	me at a different pitch. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm doing a different switch. I got my vocoder over here.
6117320	6122680	I turned the knob and now I'm, I'm,anguard. I'm singing with a higher pitch. Okay. We won't do
6122680	6131160	that. I, yo, hi. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
6131160	6136040	John Mayer went to lunch one day and he saw your mama and he said, Hey, and he said,
6136040	6140920	my name's John Mayer. And she said hi. And he said, I'm going to take you to the sky. And he
6140920	6145320	sang your body's a wonderland, but what about my dick? And she said, I'm not standing in line for
6145320	6149960	it. And he said, you don't have to, I'll take you to the front. And she said, yo, you got a fast
6149960	6163560	pass to my front. Uh, yes. All right. Yes. Yes. 10 minutes left. How it's called fast pass, you know,
6163560	6168120	you're fearless as a window. You don't let the fact that you can't think of anything stop you
6168120	6175320	from going. No, that's the, that's the virtue. You might say my mind is a wonderland. He did.
6175320	6180040	He already did. Well, he said it, but he said it in multiple ways.
6183000	6191720	Yeah. I gave you. Yeah. Um, and also we came full circle because you got to actually do some add-ins.
6191720	6197800	I did. I did. Who's the dude that does the rap add-ins? Yep. And I said, said,
6197800	6203480	Arthur, I dropped that was perfect. I mean, come on. It's hard to do. It's hard to do. You did it.
6203480	6207880	It's hard to do. It is hard to do. I mean, I'm serious. I was thinking that whole time. You
6207880	6213000	just busted off. I couldn't do one. Yeah. It was great. Well, you have to be, you have to be an
6213000	6218280	open channel, but not too open. I try to close my channels. Yeah. I hope I try to keep the aperture
6218280	6221880	just as gaping wide as possible. That makes sense. Why don't you guys get a room? You know,
6221880	6225720	he's not going to be back here next week. I won't be back next week. I didn't think, um,
6225720	6230120	you don't have to cozy up to him like this. He's a guest. I'm trying to make him feel welcome. And
6230120	6233880	like he didn't make a mistake tonight. We'll try to walk a line where you don't make me feel
6233880	6238200	unwelcome. I love that on the night of the Grammys, I take you for granted. I wrote a
6238200	6242520	song with Dan Harmon about the fact that he's having copious amounts of sex with America's
6242520	6248920	mother, America's mother. Now this, this does circle back to everything we were talking about,
6248920	6254600	being disruptive, being strange on Grammy night. I showed up here and we jammed out. And, uh,
6255400	6260520	my fate is unclear. We'll probably want to Grammy next year for this. That's, that's the only reason
6260520	6266360	I'm here. So how do we put together? I was going to say the one thing I didn't get to is Dan,
6266360	6270840	the way your mind works. And I love being a map maker. Wonderland ish. Wonderland ish. This is,
6270840	6274200	oh, that's why I could never get to it. There was the wonderland smoke bomb went on. You,
6274200	6278520	you subdivide your brain cleaves. You take one thing, you cut it into two. You go, cause it's
6278520	6283240	A and B you take B and you go because it's B with one and two and italics underneath that you,
6283240	6288040	you build it's kind of increasingly what's the mathematical, uh, theorem where you just
6288040	6292360	keep cutting the distance between here and the wall and you never get to the wall. Oh, uh,
6292360	6297000	ADD. Yeah. You have this thing where you continually keep cutting and subdividing the
6297000	6301960	idea. Jesus. And I like to do the opposite. I like to lump the ideas and I would like
6301960	6306680	in the final five minutes to put things into boxes a little bit. How are things in general?
6306680	6311560	Are you generally happy though? Fantastic. I'm generally fantastic. So you're, you're working
6311560	6314760	in the, in the, in the little nooks and crannies and things you would just, as everybody wants to
6314760	6320120	maintain and get to a healthier place. Yeah. You just seem to be more in touch with what those
6320120	6324200	things are. You tend to, which might be called gratitude, like looking and going like, oh,
6324200	6328840	here's the box I'm in. It's pretty good compared to people in Lebanon. I have to put things back
6328840	6333480	into boxes. If I take them out like we have, I think it's important to put them back in and go
6333480	6338360	like, so what is a great thing? What is something you love? What's a simple pleasure where you go,
6338360	6343640	God, I love being on this. My girlfriend, uh, is that, is that, do you, are you a, are you an
6343640	6348360	alt right guy? Are you going to call me a cuck now? No, cause I never fully figured out how cuck
6348360	6352280	the term applied to politics. Yeah. I still don't understand. Well, what about just loving your guy?
6352280	6356200	I love my girlfriend. I'm really happy to be with her. I'm so excited. I found somebody,
6356200	6360520	and it's not just cause she's in a room. I swear to God, she's not usually here. I, I, I, I,
6360520	6364760	she may have left already. I, but I really genuinely like it's a thing that I've found,
6364760	6371800	not a, not that she's a thing. It's so happy. And forensic files. So you do, so we don't have
6371800	6377000	to worry about you being in a constant state. Yeah, no, no. When you're not hearing from me,
6377000	6383640	I'm happy. Hey, that's what I think is important. No news is good news. That made me feel better
6383640	6389960	because I tend to wear the sympathetic residue of people's problems. The more you go into something,
6389960	6394520	I track it. My brain has such traction on things that I wear. Like if you ask me like,
6394520	6398600	what's that word that starts with a P that's not, and I will, I will text you four days later and
6398600	6403400	be like, are you sure it doesn't start with an L really? Yeah, I will. You were going to walk out
6403400	6407640	here worried about me being depressed. I would have texted you not worried about being depressed
6407640	6412520	because you can handle yourself. You're obviously here, but I would probably have texted you other
6412520	6417320	things to try to put into context what I wasn't sure you did or didn't. I'm truly, truly happy.
6417320	6425640	I'm very happy. I'm frustrated at this current time with the fact that the way out of this life
6427160	6431560	keeps changing. The exit ramp keeps being updated, and it's a frustrating thing, but
6432120	6439960	that's called privilege. It's like, well, I just wanted to know that five years I had a plan,
6439960	6445800	and they just keep changing the exit ramp, and I'm like, these people. But inside my car,
6445800	6454280	it smells like pine. Right. Phil Collins is playing. It's very good. There is nothing wrong.
6454280	6458760	It's you that's changing the plan. And that's the good news.
6459880	6463320	Well, I mean, I guess I would argue with that. I think it's...
6464280	6471240	You've got a strong, intelligent voice that seems to be able to hold up against a lot of forces that
6471240	6480120	normally drive intelligent minds crazy. I'll probably be fine. I just didn't see myself
6480120	6486680	lifting anything after 45. I just wanted... I had this image in my head. I thought I'd be
6486680	6490840	retired by now, because my dad worked hard until a certain age, and I was like, well,
6490840	6494680	that was dumb. You should do it that earlier. Could you be retired if you had all the money
6494680	6497640	in the world you ever wanted? Yes. Could you do it? Yes. Could you wake up tomorrow,
6498600	6501400	money's in the bank, everything's good. You couldn't spend it if you tried. Yes.
6501400	6505240	You would be okay being retired. Yes. Do you think that's true? No. Look at the thing.
6506680	6512840	Fuck no. No. Because you could have. You could have. No. No, I couldn't have. No, I couldn't have.
6512840	6518280	50,000. No. In LA, broke rider money, that's like 10 years. This is when people are like,
6518280	6522600	everybody Googles themselves. I'm like, nope, can't Google myself. I can't do it. I think it's you
6522600	6526760	that moves the gold post. Yeah, I think so. I mean, let's not. I mean... I like that you
6526760	6532680	accidentally said gold post. Does it kind of is? Does it kind of is like gold post at this point?
6532680	6536120	By the way, I don't know if you know, you're a fan of Rick and Morty. Do you know that Brandon
6536120	6541480	does the voice of Mr. Goldenfold? The math teacher. Yeah. Oh, that's great. Just a trivia.
6541480	6546440	That's great. I like him very much because he's drawn just a little differently than everyone else.
6547320	6551560	He's drawn from a different kind of nomenclature than everyone else on the show. You know what I
6551560	6556440	mean? It looks like he stumbled in from a different cartoon. He's based very much on a real life math
6556440	6562600	teacher. I had seventh grade whose last name I can't remember, but it looks like some sort of
6562600	6569000	animation exchange program. Someone from Rick and Morty is in some other like fat Albert esque kind
6569000	6575240	of show. I like that his name is Mr. Goldenfold and the principal's name is Mr. vagina. Like,
6575240	6581400	I don't know what the rest of the faculty like is everything just great. Phil Hendry. Great. The
6581400	6588680	great Phil Hendry. All right. Well, obviously you're not plugging anything. Hey, go to John
6588680	6597560	Mayer's Kickstarter. He's trying to start an actual wonderland. Just like me. Yeah. You know
6597560	6601080	what? I would enjoy a couple of comments. I'll probably go creeping around for him. We're like,
6601880	6605480	and this is the best I can do at this point in my life is someone's like, don't love his music,
6605480	6610440	but I like funnier than I thought, which is still an insult. Would you really like that?
6610440	6613400	I'm really curious about that. Would you, would you, would you like that? I don't care.
6614120	6617640	I don't care if someone likes the music. I just like when, like people have to put up a lot of
6617640	6622920	disclaimers, like actually gotta say like for, for someone to like me, they have to put up like six
6622920	6628840	or seven disclaim. I gotta say not a fan of his music and his past is shady and I wasn't into this
6628840	6634280	and that your body is wonderland is dumb, but I have to tell you in confidence that I do believe
6634280	6640040	now after watching this podcast that, uh, I now know nothing about John Mayer and I'm waiting,
6640040	6643320	I'm waiting for something positive to come along. I've settled all debts with the man.
6643320	6646600	We'll see what he comes out with next. I always see the opposite. When I see somebody go like,
6646600	6653000	I love community and I love Rick and Morty and I like, I've been trained now when I see
6653000	6658280	those two statements, that's, those sound like great things, but I know no one would say that
6658280	6662840	online if they weren't about to fucking tear me apart. That's why I like the opposite, which is
6662840	6667560	don't love his music. He's a giant piece of shit. I'm like, come, come, what, what, and,
6667560	6673560	but I gotta say, funnier than I thought. Yes. Uh, I really, I mean, I am, I am, I am super
6673560	6678680	grateful for you coming by, not just because you're super famous and it was like an interesting star
6678680	6683320	fucker win, but like the, honestly, the real, I really, really wanted you to come on the show
6683320	6690600	because we had a moment of eating pepperoni pizza and like, I, I just, um, yeah, you, you, you, you
6690680	6697800	exude an intelligence and, uh, an awareness that, uh, made me excited to talk to you. And I, I bet
6697800	6703480	a lot of our listeners are happy for it. So, and, and it's, it's, it was, you don't do this a lot.
6703480	6707000	You're not like on every podcast. I had to write some friends who've asked me to be on podcast
6707000	6711320	before. And I said, I wouldn't, I literally texted them on the way here. Literally. I actually
6711320	6714120	honestly texted them on the way here. And I was like, just want to let you know, we're going off
6714120	6718760	the Dan Harmon's podcast. I've told you, you know, in the past, but he cornered me and told me that
6719400	6724200	I had to do it. And so I'm just want to let you know. So yeah, I've lifted the embargo for this
6724200	6728200	because I find you far too interesting. I think you are diseased with your own intelligence.
6728200	6734680	We could disappear up each other's asses. Like as, uh, I, I, the show title, we have finally found
6734680	6739720	the show title, disappear up each other's ass. And that's right. No, but I really want you to
6739720	6744280	know how grateful I am. I thought that's so cool that you came out to the middle of Burbank on a
6744280	6751080	Sunday night by yourself and came here and shared your fears and insecurities and your, uh,
6751080	6755800	your, your pride and all in your, all the shit with us. Like I, I love transparency and honesty
6755800	6762120	and, uh, your, your soul is the opposite of a wonderland. Thank you, man. It's a deep labyrinth.
6762120	6768840	It's a deep land. Um, also there's other songs that he, that he, that he wrote. Yep. Oh, seven,
6768840	6773400	seven Grammys Spencer's or anything. I thought there was a reason he kept hitting it. Is there
6773400	6778920	anything you ever wanted to ask or say to John Mayer? No, I just, I identify with a lot of stuff
6778920	6784520	you were saying on stage. I don't know. Uh, I have the tiniest slice of tiny internet fame,
6784520	6788760	but a lot of what you're saying is stuff that I, I've wrestled with the dealt with that the past is
6788760	6793240	very illuminating and helpful. Oh good. Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean, we could talk, I mean, we did,
6793240	6797800	we never, we could open that module up for an hour and go into the mechanics of like how to
6797800	6803800	process what people say about you. But, um, you know, most people give their, give themselves up
6803800	6808680	in the way they write the first sentence, you know, you start seeing vocabulary, they don't realize
6809240	6813320	that they follow a pattern. We do, we know they follow a pattern. So most of the time
6813320	6817640	people just out themselves as being lame in the first sentence. You know what I mean? Yeah.
6818280	6821640	Occasionally someone will get a good hit in and I'll be like, that's a good hit.
6823960	6827080	Have you ever gone as far as like finding out like the Twitter account of the person who wrote
6827080	6832680	the article and you just think about reaching out? Well, I, I always look, I look at all of
6832680	6839400	their accounts because when somebody like takes a shot at me, I always, I block all of them and I,
6839400	6846360	and I get, and usually before I block them, I'll like send them a snapshot of their profile with
6846360	6851000	their follower numbers. And then the fact that they were following me circled and read,
6851000	6855960	and then I'll block them because I'm just like, why are you following somebody and talking shit?
6855960	6861400	You're dumb. I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why. The whole thing comes down to an Acura
6861400	6868200	Integra. I knew it. It all comes down to an Acura Integra. Beautiful car. I'm sure it's a great
6868200	6875880	value. People want you to have one so that Acura keeps giving money to the people who want you to
6875880	6880840	have one. 50% of the articles that are written on these sites that try to sell you the Acura
6880840	6887960	Integra are very important. They're meaningful. The other 50% is absolute garbage meant to drive
6887960	6894760	you to just nothing but sales and clicks. Your responsibility is to figure out which 50% is
6894760	6901880	which and block out the dumb shit. That's the challenge. It all goes back to an Acura Integra.
6902600	6907560	That's true. All right. That's the closer. Let's fucking close the show. I, I, I,
6907560	6912280	I'm not going to monopolize it. John Mayer, ladies and gentlemen, uh, thank him for coming.
6912280	6916600	Thank you very much. This is awesome. Yeah. And let's, let's end our podcast. Let's,
6916600	6922520	let's, let's all go do things that are relatively important. Like going to bed with Cody.
6923960	6929080	I'm going to drive home. Your body is going to get in my head. It's going to corkscrew.
6929080	6932920	It's going to say, John, fuck you. There's some things you just shouldn't do. You're going to run
6932920	6936600	the whole transcript through the brick. You call the brain and then you're going to complain.
6936600	6939960	You're going to ask if you can take it out. And the next time they put it up on the net,
6939960	6944440	you're going to say, uh, that thing I'd rather forget. Can we take the rap out? We do it yet.
6944440	6947480	I just don't want to hear from people telling me that there was something I said that they could
6947480	6951720	get the smell on me, that I was trying too hard in the backyard. I bought the milkshake,
6951720	6957320	but it had lard and it was all curdled. Yeah, I don't want to be that way. So I think I did it
6957320	6960840	right. But now that I did, that's why I kept rapping tonight. So when I get in the car,
6960840	6966360	I think about the rap. This is the thing that I did. That's crap to make it off balance,
6966360	6971160	to make it strange. It's got to be strange. So tomorrow is a new day, a new direction,
6971160	6975960	a new way. I got to improve. I got to change. I did it too well tonight. That wraps my brain.
6975960	6979480	I got to get in the tub and wonder what I can write to tell you. Can you take a couple things
6979480	6984600	out tonight? Cause I don't like two legs. I don't like four legs. I don't like even pegs.
6984600	6991720	I like shit missing. That's when my brain goes, listen out. Ooh, opioid love on up there in the
6991720	7000680	tub. Oh, holy fuck. Just blew our fucking mind. You buried the lead. You fucking rap. Good.
7001560	7006840	I'm embarrassed that I did it in front of you. You can never come back again.
7006840	7016600	That was amazing. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.
7021640	7026840	Tasty guitar part or press that able to button. So we're good. This is how fast you wrap. Okay.
7026840	7030360	You're wrapping up fast. If you can only wrap the fast, if you talk gibberish,
7030360	7034120	like I'm saying, you can't talk from the outside. You just wrapped this fast and you're making it
7034120	7039800	up. In fact, wrap it fast. I can't freestyle it. That's fucking crazy.
7042600	7047480	Took it out. Took it out. How about 80s? Took it out.
7051960	7053320	That's not even in the right key.
7053320	7070040	What time is your massage scheduled for? Good night. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks to Steve Levy. Thanks
7070040	7078120	to Chris Bohroff, Zach, the Audio Maniacs, Sarah Hill, Nolan Fabricus, Kevin Day, Brandon,
7078120	7096920	our guest comptroller, of course, Dan Harmon, John Mayer. Thank you so much. Drive fast. Take chances.
7096920	7111720	Did you get any of that? It's a good show.
