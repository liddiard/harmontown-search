0	20000	["I Want My Weed from Mezzer-e-de-happies!" plays in the background as the audience cheers and applauds.]
20000	21000	That's good booze!
21000	25000	Hello, everybody! Welcome back to Meltdown Conference in Hollywood, California!
26000	31000	I trust that your holidays were glorious. I know mine was, and I know Dan's was.
33000	37000	We've been to Scotland and Dan was in Ireland, but we're back now with my favorite words.
37000	42000	I get to say one more time, for the first time in 2014, Harmentown was now in session.
46000	49000	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmentown, Dan Harmon!
56000	57000	Thank you very much.
62000	67000	Thank you for showing up in such numbers. I didn't even tweet it.
68000	72000	You know, Harmentown live audience members, and not the listeners, I'm saying.
73000	77000	The people that show up for the live show, they're very fair-weather friends.
78000	82000	They do, they're like, oh, the show's good again, let's go.
86000	89000	You remember when I got hired back, they showed up.
90000	93000	Right. I mean, I'm less cynical than you, maybe.
93000	95000	I thought this was just because we've been gone for a while.
95000	98000	This was our triumphant return from the United Kingdom.
99000	100000	Maybe they're good people.
101000	106000	Or, I mean, let's be honest, everybody, maybe by a very honest show of applause.
106000	109000	Who's here simply because the community is back up with Dan Harmon?
109000	111000	Yeah, all right.
111000	114000	Okay, three very honest people and 30 liars.
116000	119000	No, I mean, it wouldn't really make sense for that to be the motivation.
119000	125000	So, you can probably hear from my voice that I'm a little under the weather.
125000	130000	I caught some kind of Scottish Ebola in Scotland, of all places.
132000	141000	Edinburgh, who was wonderful, couldn't ask for a more beautiful, welcoming city full of joy and delight.
142000	149000	Two guys high-fived my rental kilt, and one of them gave me fucking barbarian herpes.
151000	156000	This is some old-school bubonic, old-world microbial fucking...
156000	159000	You got sick the New Year's Day, I think, right?
159000	163000	Yeah, it was right after Hagmany, which is what they call their New Year's celebration in Edinburgh.
163000	166000	I kept to myself that night.
166000	170000	I had two glasses of cider because my rental shoes were...
171000	173000	That was the only mistake I made that night.
173000	177000	I couldn't walk around in these fucking wingtips that I got from the kilt rental place.
177000	181000	I should have realized that Scottish people aren't going to wear...
181000	184000	They're not going to dress fancy for Hagmany.
184000	191000	They'll put their kilt on so that their balls can be cooled in the nice night air
191000	196000	because it's fun to wear a kilt, but they put on their Doc Martens and their Converse and stuff,
196000	199000	and they run around the cobblestone streets like pigs.
201000	202000	Wow.
202000	204000	Wonderful pigs.
204000	206000	I'm not saying they're pigs.
206000	209000	Yeah, I wore my own bros that night. I brought my own shoes.
209000	212000	To me, renting shoes is like...
212000	215000	That's why I don't bowl. That's fucking... That's no good.
215000	220000	So anyways, the truth is, and I say this without shame, that's not true,
220000	226000	but I spent at least 35 minutes of that New Year's Eve on the toilet.
226000	230000	I just sat on the toilet in the stall because it's where I could sit down
230000	232000	because my shoes hurt so bad.
232000	234000	I was just a sad little wallflower.
234000	237000	I played my farm game on my phone,
237000	239000	and everyone in the other room was like...
243000	245000	It was a room full of Popeyes.
249000	253000	And I touched two people that night that weren't errant.
253000	257000	Also, you were walking around in a pretty chilly Scotland in a kilt.
257000	259000	I don't think that's where illness comes from.
259000	262000	It comes from other people. I don't think it's not...
262000	264000	The illness doesn't come from cold.
264000	267000	I was very gregarious and slapped a lot of fives that night.
267000	268000	I didn't get any cold.
268000	270000	There was one guy I remember.
270000	272000	I remember him walking by me, and he went,
272000	276000	respect, and high five me on the way home.
276000	280000	And that high five, I think some fucking purple monster
280000	283000	leapt from his hand to mine,
283000	287000	and then jumped into my mouth and laid eggs in my chest.
287000	289000	Jaron is at home right now.
289000	291000	She's not here?
291000	293000	You don't think that she wanted to come here
293000	295000	and talk about the events of the holiday?
295000	297000	That's how bad this fucker is.
297000	298000	She's sick too.
301000	304000	Don't applaud Aaron being sick, you assholes.
304000	306000	That's very rude.
306000	309000	Oh, you mean the new news?
309000	310000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
310000	314000	I proposed marriage to Aaron McGathey, and...
323000	325000	Pressure's off now, man, today.
325000	328000	I was just machine gun farting in bed, like...
331000	333000	Because every time I cough, I fart in tune.
333000	336000	Wait, but are you saying...
336000	338000	I'm not doing it on purpose.
338000	340000	But I also...
340000	342000	Because the cough is loud in my head,
342000	343000	so I feel like I got away with it,
343000	344000	and then I look over and she's like,
344000	347000	what the fuck? What are you doing?
347000	349000	And then you point to her ring and you just keep farting?
349000	351000	Yeah.
351000	353000	Are you saying up until the engagement,
353000	356000	you've issued some restraints?
356000	358000	A couple slipped out.
358000	360000	No, you guys talk about farting all over each other,
360000	362000	don't you? Isn't that a thing?
362000	365000	I have farted before, but every time I have,
365000	368000	what I've thought is, I better marry her.
371000	373000	So romantic.
373000	374000	Very romantic.
374000	375000	That's what love is.
375000	377000	Now, take the crowd, if you would, Dan.
377000	379000	Take us through the...
379000	381000	Now, we get to Scotland.
381000	382000	I thought...
382000	384000	I did not know for certain that you were going to propose.
384000	386000	I figured you were.
386000	389000	I felt like that was in the ether.
389000	392000	Kate, my girlfriend, she had talked to you about it,
392000	394000	so she knew, but she didn't tell me.
394000	397000	So when Kate and I landed in Scotland,
397000	399000	we took different planes, but we landed in Scotland
399000	401000	within minutes of each other.
401000	404000	You guys had just gotten there, and we landed,
404000	406000	and take us through...
406000	409000	Would you, from the beginning of the Scotland season...
409000	411000	Well, as everyone knows, I'm a big planner.
411000	413000	Like, that's my wheelhouse.
413000	415000	As the show can testify to.
415000	418000	They call me Mr. Forsyte.
418000	422000	They call me Schedule Steve.
425000	428000	Dan stayed up all night thinking of that character, too.
430000	433000	Schedule Steve.
433000	435000	I love that you're a writer.
435000	438000	So, I thought, let's embrace that idea.
438000	442000	To marry me is to marry organic chaos,
442000	445000	not, you know...
445000	446000	Schedule Steve.
446000	448000	Not an Excel spreadsheet, you know?
448000	450000	Yeah, not Schedule Steve.
450000	452000	Don't truck Dan.
452000	454000	That's through your marrying.
454000	456000	And I thought, you know what?
456000	458000	You know what it's going to turn out is...
458000	460000	It's going to be romantic, because, you know,
460000	461000	it's not romantic.
461000	463000	It's stress, and anxiety, and planning,
463000	464000	and being outside the moment.
464000	466000	Shoot from the hip, baby.
466000	468000	And, you know, we're going to be having a great time,
468000	471000	and I'll just have this ring on me all the time,
471000	473000	and that way, right at the moment,
473000	476000	this is an idea I got from Jim on The Office.
479000	481000	At the right moment, I will bust it out.
481000	482000	It'll be perfect.
482000	485000	Now, I'm going to pause you there,
485000	487000	because this is a question I don't actually know.
487000	490000	Did you think in your head there would be a certain day
490000	493000	before Christmas, because we left on the 21st,
493000	495000	landing on the 22nd.
495000	496000	Did you think it would be pre-Christmas,
496000	497000	maybe over Christmas?
497000	498000	No, I didn't think about it.
498000	499000	Okay.
499000	501000	All right.
501000	503000	No preconceived notions of what day,
503000	505000	or what would be too late, or too early,
505000	506000	or too anything?
506000	507000	No.
507000	508000	I probably didn't want to wait until the last day,
508000	509000	but I also knew that...
509000	510000	Whatever.
510000	511000	Who cares?
511000	512000	Okay, gotcha.
512000	513000	All right.
513000	518000	I got my Kettle One Alliance backpack.
518000	521000	Kettle One sent me a backpack
521000	525000	when they welcomed me into the Alliance.
525000	526000	And I'm not...
526000	528000	The story I'm going to tell you is not...
528000	530000	You're going to think that I'm pretending
530000	533000	that I had feelings for this backpack.
533000	535000	I really did.
535000	536000	Before this happened,
536000	538000	this was the first backpack I've ever had
538000	540000	that I was like, that's a cool backpack.
540000	542000	Because that's like, who cares about a backpack?
542000	544000	This backpack was cool.
544000	546000	It was a really cool backpack.
546000	549000	It had a microchip in it
549000	551000	that if I lost my backpack,
551000	555000	or I assume was kidnapped while drinking Kettle One
555000	558000	by Irish whiskey runners or something,
558000	562000	that Kettle One would paratroop people in and, you know...
562000	565000	Whoo!
566000	568000	What is the actual purpose of that microchip?
568000	571000	It's like a low jack for your backpack.
571000	574000	Cracker jack.
576000	580000	I mean, that might be the quickest we've ever had a title for our episode.
580000	584000	So, we got a lot of guests tonight, so let me rip through this.
584000	589000	So, we're on the plane.
589000	592000	What do you call it? The airplane.
592000	595000	Virgin Atlantic has a bar on its plane in first class.
595000	597000	If there's a bar in any vehicle,
597000	600000	I'm going to spend all my time at it because it's just on principle.
600000	602000	Like, if you had a bar in your car,
602000	605000	even if it was the least comfortable spot in the car,
605000	608000	I'd be like, I'm at a bar in a car!
608000	611000	You know, when you get on a train and there's a bar car,
611000	615000	you jam in there, even though it's not going to treat you like shit.
615000	619000	But there's a little tiny bar in a Virgin Atlantic flight,
619000	623000	and I drank for like eight hours on the flight.
623000	627000	Erin was starting to feel she wasn't up to too much drinking,
627000	630000	and she ate this bacon buddy as we were landing.
630000	635000	Like, it's a bacon sandwich that they make in Europe somehow.
635000	638000	And apparently it was kind of bad.
638000	643000	And I got off the plane like really at my most charming
643000	647000	because I got this atom bomb in my backpack
647000	650000	that has instant happiness,
650000	653000	and I just drank on a plane for eight hours,
653000	656000	and I'm arriving at Heathrow Airport,
656000	659000	which is one of the most delightful places you could ever be.
659000	662000	It's just the joy there. It's palpable.
665000	668000	I have a different relationship with that airport.
668000	671000	No, Heathrow is pretty miserable.
671000	674000	So we get on this tram,
674000	676000	and we're walking through the airport,
676000	677000	and I'm just like...
677000	680000	Meaning you've flown the ten and a half hours to London,
680000	682000	and you have a connector to Edinburgh.
682000	684000	So you're getting your connecting flight.
684000	686000	So I'm doing bits. I'm looking at the sign going,
686000	688000	eh, that guy looks like you've got antlers.
688000	691000	And Erin's like, yeah, oh, shut up.
691000	693000	And she went to the bathroom,
693000	697000	and I think she said that she vomited in the bathroom, I think.
697000	701000	And I'm like, oh, baby, it's a bad bacon buddy? Yeah.
701000	705000	We get on this tram. Stop.
706000	707000	What were you going to say?
707000	708000	Nothing.
708000	709000	You were going to say something?
709000	711000	Meaningless question. Go ahead.
711000	713000	Well, now I want to know.
713000	716000	Did she throw up on the plane or in the airport?
716000	718000	I think the airport. I can't remember.
718000	720000	What a terrible, dumb question.
723000	725000	Dan, we have a lot of guests. Get through this.
725000	728000	I know. Fucking, this is insane.
728000	730000	And guests, you have to treat right,
730000	732000	or they fucking fly the coop, man.
732000	735000	Birds on a wire should be the theme of the night.
735000	738000	We got some humdingers, people that are hard guests.
738000	739000	Tell the story.
739000	740000	All right.
743000	745000	So she's looking kind of queasy,
745000	746000	and I'm on the tram with her,
746000	749000	and I'm still kind of picking and grinning.
749000	751000	What does that expression mean?
751000	754000	You're a banjo player, apparently.
754000	756000	But Erin's not looking too good.
756000	758000	I start rubbing her back on the tram,
758000	761000	and she's like, can you stop rubbing my back?
761000	763000	And these trams are chock full of people.
764000	766000	A 10-minute tram from one terminal to the other.
766000	768000	Yeah, we're just standing there,
768000	771000	holding the doohickeys, the handles.
771000	772000	Everyone's standing up.
772000	773000	There's a standing room only.
773000	775000	We're swaying and moving,
775000	778000	and Erin says, can you please stop rubbing my back?
778000	780000	That's pretty nauseous
780000	783000	when comfort is now making you sick.
783000	785000	So she gets this look on her face
785000	788000	at a certain point that is unmistakable.
788000	793000	And I instinctively, not consciously,
793000	795000	because I loved this backpack.
795000	799000	Instinctively.
799000	801000	Before I knew what I was doing,
801000	803000	the muscles in my arms,
803000	807000	years of college and bad improv troupe parties
807000	812000	and had my muscle memory unzip
812000	814000	the first zipper on the backpack,
814000	816000	hold it wide open just as she leaned into it
816000	818000	and firehosed,
818000	822000	probably eight quarts of...
822000	824000	what do you call it? Vomit.
824000	825000	Vomit.
825000	827000	Into the backpack, which again,
827000	829000	and this is the poetic tragedy of it,
829000	830000	it's such a good backpack
830000	834000	that it holds it like a waterproof bucket.
834000	838000	This isn't some jag-off, Garfield knapsack
838000	839000	that your mom stuck you with.
839000	842000	This isn't some bullshit for your pencils.
842000	844000	This thing has a computer in it.
844000	847000	It's the night rider of backpacks.
847000	851000	It holds shit, literally.
851000	855000	And it's deep, but not a drop hits the floor.
855000	858000	And by the way, shout out to the cosmopolitan community
858000	860000	of London Heathrow Airport.
860000	862000	Everybody just totally, not in a New York,
862000	865000	like kind of callous way, nothing against New York.
865000	867000	You do what you do to survive
867000	869000	when somebody has something to happen on a subway.
869000	871000	But like, I mean, just in this sort of like,
871000	873000	yeah, we all get it.
873000	877000	Everyone at London Heathrow is from way somewhere else
877000	880000	and has been through all kinds of stuff, I assume.
880000	882000	And if they haven't,
882000	886000	just the environment kind of dictates that you feel that way.
886000	889000	So there was no gawking and there was no chiding
889000	891000	and there was no...
891000	894000	A couple people moved away out of politeness.
894000	896000	And then one guy was standing right next to me
896000	899000	right at the end of it, like a real subtle move,
899000	903000	just pulls out a little disposable Kleenex pack
903000	905000	and offers it to Erin and she says thank you
905000	907000	and dabs her thing and the tram stops
907000	910000	and I've got a backpack full of vomit
910000	914000	and now I realize my house key is in there,
914000	917000	my iPad mini is in there,
917000	919000	and you know, the ring.
919000	934000	So we get off the tram and we go to a bathroom.
934000	937000	It's situations like this where you find out there are bathrooms
937000	939000	where you never would have known there was a bathroom.
939000	941000	I don't think anyone had been to this bathroom.
941000	942000	You know, like if you're in the grocery store
942000	943000	and you have to pee all of a sudden
943000	946000	you're like in some weird bathroom next to the eggs.
946000	948000	Because I had a backpack full of puke,
948000	951000	I found a long lost bathroom
951000	954000	and he'd throw an airport under a stairway or something.
954000	958000	And I open it up and it's, you use your own imagination,
958000	961000	but it's like, Erin's in the women's room,
961000	963000	she's like, she's going are you alright?
963000	965000	And I'm like yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna stall
965000	967000	and I'm like fuck, fuck, fuck.
967000	968000	You can hear her through the wall?
968000	970000	I can hear her, she's calling out to me.
970000	974000	And I know where the house key is
974000	978000	and it's six feet down, you know?
978000	986000	And I'm just like, ah, ah, ah, fuck.
986000	989000	I just gotta thrust my hand in and pull out the key
989000	992000	and put that down on the top of the toilet paper
992000	996000	and I'm like okay, now we gotta find my precious.
996000	999000	And we can be certain that in there,
999000	1001000	part of it is a bad bacon buddy.
1001000	1003000	As a bacon roll, yeah, it's not good.
1003000	1006000	She didn't just have cream of wheat.
1006000	1008000	It's bad news then.
1008000	1009000	What is this?
1009000	1013000	Spike and Mike's Twisted Animation Festival?
1013000	1016000	You wanna talk about the puke?
1016000	1018000	I'm just trying to paint a picture for you.
1018000	1019000	Were there carrots in it?
1019000	1022000	That's not Ed McMahon territory.
1022000	1026000	Don't tell me how to be a comptroller.
1026000	1031000	Everyone in this room can fill in their own puke blanks
1031000	1033000	about the actual substance.
1033000	1036000	In the history of the Earth, there's never been pleasant vomit.
1036000	1039000	What did she have for breakfast?
1039000	1044000	So then I reach in, I get out the ring box
1044000	1047000	and I rinse everything off and she can hear me going,
1047000	1049000	fuck, fuck, fuck.
1049000	1051000	She thinks I'm just mad at her for ruining the backpack
1051000	1053000	but of course I'm mad because I'm getting puke all over my hands
1053000	1056000	because there's stuff in there.
1056000	1058000	Also, I'm kind of thinking in my head,
1058000	1062000	well now, even if I fuck up the proposal, there's still a story.
1062000	1065000	So it was kind of a good thing.
1065000	1067000	I remember in my head thinking like, this is actually working out
1067000	1069000	except I'm losing the backpack.
1069000	1072000	And I know for sure at Heathrow Airport of all places
1072000	1077000	to put a, just take a backpack, a brand new backpack
1077000	1080000	and just, there was one tiny trash can
1080000	1082000	that was smaller than the backpack
1082000	1086000	and I just kind of tried to get it in there but just left it.
1086000	1089000	Can you imagine after I got on whatever plane,
1089000	1091000	there must have been like a bomb squad for sure
1091000	1094000	like circling this thing,
1094000	1097000	two, three, two, go, give me a report.
1097000	1100000	You know, the guy comes up and opens it and goes like,
1100000	1103000	ugh.
1103000	1106000	So that happened and then I proposed on the money banks
1106000	1110000	of the Loch Ness lock.
1111000	1114000	Yeah.
1114000	1117000	But the puke, that's the story.
1117000	1118000	The story, yeah.
1118000	1119000	Because I fucked up.
1119000	1121000	I kept walking around with the ring.
1121000	1123000	So because I'm walking around with this ring,
1123000	1126000	because I'm burdened with creating this special moment,
1126000	1128000	I'm just burdened, I'm putting it on myself.
1128000	1130000	The dumbest thing I could have done, it turns out.
1130000	1132000	All the anxiety, all of the stress,
1132000	1134000	if I had just planned something,
1134000	1136000	I could have just spent the rest of the time
1136000	1139000	and put the ring on top of the dresser at the hotel room
1139000	1143000	or arranged with Kate to have her hold it in a thing.
1143000	1146000	I could have done a million things to just relax during the trip
1146000	1149000	but because I want to play it organic and be Jim from the office,
1149000	1152000	I'm walking around with this lump in my pocket
1152000	1154000	and every time Erin tries to hold my hand in a certain way
1154000	1158000	and put it in my pocket, I'm like slapping her hand away
1158000	1161000	and she's like, this is the worst trip ever.
1161000	1163000	My boyfriend hates me.
1163000	1165000	There was one time when she started rubbing my thigh
1165000	1168000	in the back seat of the car and at that point,
1168000	1170000	that morning I had gone, you know what, fuck the box.
1170000	1172000	Box probably still has puke on it.
1172000	1174000	It's really hard to hide.
1174000	1175000	It's a giant box.
1175000	1178000	I'm just going to take the ring and carry it around in my pocket.
1178000	1180000	And then Erin started rubbing my thigh in the back of the car
1180000	1183000	very romantically and I'm like, I grabbed her hand,
1183000	1186000	like all asperger-y, like grabbed her hand and like,
1186000	1189000	the hair done.
1189000	1191000	I'm like, is this what you want?
1191000	1192000	You want me to hold your hand?
1192000	1194000	Is that why you're rubbing it on me?
1194000	1196000	She just like looked at me and I don't know.
1196000	1197000	What can you say?
1197000	1198000	What can you do?
1198000	1199000	Then I went to dinner with her.
1199000	1201000	I'm like, okay, let's just do it at a nice dinner.
1201000	1204000	This is our first night in Edinburgh, right?
1204000	1207000	We go to a decent place, but it's too shitty and cheesy.
1207000	1209000	It's like a TGA Friday.
1209000	1211000	I'm not going to propose to her here.
1211000	1213000	But Erin's bringing these presents and she keeps,
1213000	1216000	somehow the lie became that I had a present for her.
1216000	1217000	But this is after Christmas.
1217000	1219000	Christmas had already passed at this point.
1219000	1220000	We're back in Edinburgh.
1220000	1223000	Yes, so she's anxious but she hadn't given me my Christmas present yet.
1223000	1224000	I don't have any Christmas presents for her.
1224000	1225000	All I have is a ring.
1225000	1229000	But you said we're going to do our presents later because like, right?
1229000	1233000	You didn't exchange presents on Christmas Eve or Christmas because of this?
1233000	1236000	I didn't plan anything.
1236000	1241000	I just, I said at one point, every time Christmas presents came up,
1241000	1243000	I was like, we don't have to do that now.
1243000	1245000	There was never a good time to open presents.
1245000	1249000	This is not an important part of the conversation.
1249000	1251000	I would have gone with Christmas.
1251000	1257000	Seems like a good time.
1257000	1263000	For presents.
1263000	1267000	So we go to a restaurant and then I'm getting mad at her
1267000	1269000	because she's trying to give me Christmas presents
1269000	1270000	and I'm like, can't we do that later?
1270000	1271000	And she's like, no.
1271000	1272000	I really want to do it now.
1272000	1275000	And I like rip open one and it's like a key chain finder.
1275000	1277000	And I'm like, well, we're going to do this again
1277000	1278000	because we already tried this.
1278000	1280000	These things don't work.
1280000	1281000	And she's like, what?
1281000	1283000	Why am I sorry I got you Christmas presents?
1283000	1284000	And I'm like, I don't know.
1284000	1285000	What's the next one?
1285000	1289000	HD spy camera pen, fuck off.
1289000	1290000	Check, please.
1290000	1291000	Let's just get out of here.
1291000	1292000	And she's like, what is happening?
1292000	1293000	What is going on?
1293000	1294000	I don't know.
1294000	1295000	I don't know.
1295000	1297000	You know what it sounds like to me?
1297000	1301000	It sounds like you became schedule Steve.
1301000	1302000	Yeah.
1302000	1303000	I atoned with that.
1303000	1304000	Yeah.
1304000	1307000	So we were not walking in the night air at that boat.
1307000	1309000	I was like, okay, this time I'm going to do it.
1309000	1311000	We had a nice walk.
1311000	1313000	You guys went into the restaurant.
1313000	1315000	I'm like, I'm going to talk to Erin over here.
1315000	1316000	And I took her pitch black.
1316000	1319000	So I'm squishing her out of the mud.
1319000	1322000	It was absolute darkness on the bank.
1322000	1326000	The next day we would see that 30 yards away there was a perfect spot to propose.
1326000	1331000	There was a place designed to feed Nessie out of your hands
1331000	1338000	where swans would circle you and hummingbirds would pick the wax out of your ears.
1338000	1344000	I did it by the wood chipper.
1344000	1348000	There really was a couple of fallen trees and a tractor.
1348000	1351000	Like a sign for iron brew or something.
1351000	1353000	A broken fence, yeah.
1353000	1358000	But it doesn't matter because I'm a catch.
1358000	1360000	My proposal doesn't have to be amazing.
1360000	1362000	My marriage will be amazing.
1362000	1363000	All right.
1363000	1366000	Let's get our cavalcade of guests up there.
1366000	1372000	Wait, real quick, real quick, before we do, what did she say?
1372000	1375000	She's going to do it. She's going to give it a shot.
1375000	1377000	All right, let's bring out our guests.
1377000	1382000	Let's bring Mitch Hurwitz up first.
1396000	1406000	You know, from back there, it almost sounded as if you brought Jeff with you
1406000	1409000	to propose to your girlfriend. Is that all possible?
1409000	1410000	I did kind of.
1410000	1412000	Why were you together? What was the plan?
1412000	1414000	We're inseparable.
1414000	1421000	No, we had planned a long time ago to go on this Scottish vacation together for the holidays.
1421000	1425000	That's really weird.
1426000	1428000	Would you ever travel with my family?
1428000	1429000	Would you ever be game for me?
1429000	1430000	I actually have.
1430000	1433000	Oh, that's right.
1433000	1435000	We were in St. Martin together a couple of years ago.
1435000	1440000	That's why I know you.
1440000	1442000	Have you already proposed to your wife, Mitch?
1442000	1444000	Because Jeff's got some pointers.
1444000	1445000	I have, unfortunately.
1445000	1449000	Wait, wait, wait. What's that about?
1449000	1451000	You told me I should have done it on Christmas.
1451000	1453000	No, I opened the gifts on Christmas.
1453000	1456000	Open the gifts on Christmas?
1456000	1458000	I thought you said I would have done it on Christmas.
1458000	1460000	I would have proposed to my girlfriend on Christmas.
1460000	1462000	You said there's no good time to open the gifts.
1462000	1466000	I proposed to my wife on Hanukkah, so it was like an eight-day.
1466000	1469000	I serialized it.
1469000	1474000	She kind of saw it coming around day six.
1474000	1479000	I kept saying, you'll see. No presents.
1480000	1485000	Any advice for newlyweds?
1485000	1488000	Oh, newlyweds.
1488000	1490000	You know, it's funny. I was in New York.
1490000	1498000	I have a very good friend who works at the Kettle One Backpack Tracking Center.
1498000	1502000	And just for fun, I said, bring up Dan Harmon.
1502000	1505000	And we went off of the grid, apparently, somewhere in Heathrow.
1505000	1507000	We lost you. We couldn't figure out why.
1507000	1512000	Yeah, that backpack is now deep under the MI6.
1512000	1514000	Yeah, our guys went out there, and they couldn't find it.
1514000	1518000	But we picked you up with the Keychain Tracker.
1518000	1520000	We got you in Scotland.
1520000	1524000	Dan, why weren't you pleased with the spy pen?
1524000	1526000	Did she give you a spy pen camera?
1526000	1531000	I was in a tailspin because I didn't know when to propose to my girlfriend
1531000	1533000	and how to do it, and was now...
1533000	1539000	Somehow, I had brought this Jambox, okay?
1539000	1541000	I did a similar thing.
1541000	1543000	The ReGift Jambox.
1543000	1546000	So I would have a Christmas gift.
1546000	1548000	We were going to exchange Christmas gifts in Scotland.
1548000	1551000	Well, she puked on the Jambox, too.
1551000	1557000	And after the puking thing, I gave her the Jambox and said,
1557000	1562000	well, here, you carry this now. That's your Christmas present.
1562000	1565000	Because I had no backpack anymore.
1565000	1568000	There was no more way to walk around with all my little ruses
1568000	1572000	and little wheelie wonk-up trick bag.
1572000	1575000	Were you nervous? I got very nervous before I proposed.
1575000	1578000	And my whole plan was...
1578000	1581000	Well, actually, I ended up...
1581000	1586000	I was halfway through a metaphor, and I realized I had to abandon it.
1586000	1590000	But it's a better story if I didn't, which was that I started to say...
1590000	1595000	I really started to think, sometimes you have to shit or get off the pot.
1595000	1599000	I'd like to take that shit.
1599000	1602000	It's you.
1602000	1604000	Really almost...
1604000	1608000	And actually, I remember thinking, we've been in this relationship for a long time,
1608000	1611000	and she understands that this has been hard for me.
1611000	1615000	What I'm going to do is I'm going to say, this is a ring just to get us started.
1615000	1617000	Just totally misguided.
1617000	1619000	But it was going to be...
1619000	1622000	And then we'll experience what it's like to be,
1622000	1624000	and we'll take our time, and we'll see if it...
1624000	1629000	And then, of course, when I was there and proposing, it all tumbled out at me.
1629000	1633000	I want to have children with you. I want my children to look like you.
1633000	1635000	I want you in my life forever.
1635000	1637000	When I...
1637000	1642000	If that's a waterfall, mine was just a fucking gridlock.
1642000	1644000	And I ended up...
1644000	1649000	The part of the gridlock that was moving the John McClain that got out of one car
1649000	1653000	and walked along the roofs, was me talking about the ring
1653000	1657000	and being like, oh, I wanted to get you the one you wanted, but...
1657000	1659000	Etsy shopping...
1659000	1661000	I'm like, I haven't asked you to marry me yet.
1661000	1665000	I'm fucking talking about the fucking ring. I'm idiot, idiot, idiot.
1665000	1669000	And then you get the proposal out, and you realize, oh, wait, there's another step.
1669000	1672000	But you do kind of feel like, oh, that's done.
1672000	1675000	Oh, and are you game, or do you want to...
1675000	1677000	I assume...
1677000	1679000	Yeah, I fucked up.
1679000	1680000	I fucked up.
1680000	1684000	But it's okay, because I'm a fuckup.
1684000	1685000	No, you're not.
1685000	1687000	This is... And I think, you know...
1687000	1690000	First of all, the first wives are... Well, I don't want to say that.
1690000	1693000	No, they have to... They understand that, you know...
1693000	1695000	But they...
1695000	1697000	I think it's fantastic. I really do.
1697000	1701000	It's a second wife that really gets that really...
1701000	1703000	That scoreboard at the stadium.
1703000	1705000	Where did the music come from? I talked to the guy.
1705000	1706000	I know the guy.
1706000	1709000	This isn't my first time on the rodeo, honey.
1709000	1711000	Will you marry me?
1711000	1713000	But in the middle of an actual...
1713000	1715000	Abracadabra!
1715000	1717000	How did you get the rodeo clowns to stop?
1717000	1719000	I know everybody here.
1719000	1723000	How did you fit the ring in your penis?
1723000	1725000	And have it come out...
1725000	1728000	Apparently, this might be apocryphal, but we...
1728000	1734000	You might know this comedy writer who proposed to someone by putting it up as anus.
1734000	1735000	What?
1735000	1736000	Yeah.
1736000	1737000	It said...
1737000	1738000	Which malware?
1738000	1741000	Dino?
1741000	1743000	Dino's first husband.
1743000	1746000	No, I can't... I can't...
1746000	1749000	Well, this doesn't go any further.
1749000	1751000	No, I can't. I can't. I can't.
1751000	1754000	What is his name where I'm with?
1754000	1758000	Ah...
1758000	1759000	Maybe we better bring him out.
1759000	1762000	Harris Whittles is here tonight.
1771000	1772000	Hi, hello.
1772000	1775000	If you want to pretend it's not you, that's fine.
1775000	1778000	I thought that was urban legend, but that's true.
1778000	1779000	Yeah, you know who it is?
1779000	1780000	Yeah.
1780000	1781000	Yeah, I think it's true.
1781000	1785000	Well, what was the... Within the urban legend, what is the motivation?
1785000	1786000	Was it humor or sexual...?
1786000	1787000	It was humor, yeah.
1787000	1791000	Like, aren't I interesting? And...
1791000	1792000	Apparently...
1792000	1795000	And she apparently didn't see it as a warning, a big warning.
1795000	1796000	It's good.
1796000	1798000	Young ladies, please.
1798000	1801000	You don't need this much interesting in your life.
1801000	1802000	It's a good final test.
1802000	1804000	Is this writer still alive?
1804000	1805000	Yes.
1805000	1806000	Okay.
1806000	1807000	I thought it was somebody else.
1807000	1809000	I mean, there was some anal hemorrhaging, is that what you're asking?
1809000	1811000	Yeah, there was some internal bleeding.
1811000	1813000	It's a diamond ring.
1815000	1819000	I guess my question is, was it square cut, marquee, pair?
1819000	1822000	I think it was missing a baguette when it came. I don't know.
1824000	1825000	I feel like shit.
1825000	1828000	Do you guys want to talk about something funny for me?
1829000	1830000	Do you feel bad? Do you feel...
1830000	1831000	I feel terrible.
1831000	1834000	I told... I got Scottish...
1834000	1836000	I don't know what the hell you'd call it.
1836000	1843000	I woke up the day after New Year's and it's like that cold, sharp little feeling in your chest.
1843000	1848000	You can just feel it exponentially spreading.
1848000	1850000	You know this is going to be a doozy.
1850000	1851000	And then Erin kept...
1851000	1853000	I'm going to throw her under the bus because she's not here.
1853000	1854000	Let's have kids.
1854000	1855000	Because she's so fucking sick.
1855000	1857000	And when are we going to buy a house together?
1857000	1859000	I started saying, I can feel something bad coming out.
1859000	1861000	She's like, knock it off.
1861000	1862000	Just say you're not sick.
1862000	1864000	Save it till you get home.
1865000	1867000	And I'm like, this isn't one of those.
1867000	1868000	This is like a thing.
1868000	1869000	And now she's...
1869000	1870000	I love you, honey.
1870000	1872000	Sitting at home right now with...
1872000	1873000	She's got it too.
1873000	1874000	Yeah.
1874000	1878000	When we got to Ireland, she woke up the next day and was like...
1881000	1882000	And I was like...
1886000	1889000	My legs hurt from basketball.
1889000	1890000	Yeah.
1891000	1893000	Are you one of these guys that plays with Gary Sandling?
1893000	1894000	I wanted to be.
1894000	1898000	I was invited by someone that we know.
1898000	1899000	And I thought...
1899000	1900000	And she was like, it's comics.
1900000	1901000	It'll be fun.
1901000	1905000	I was immediately worried that I was going to have to be very funny during this game.
1905000	1907000	That's what I was worried about.
1907000	1909000	But then I got there and no one was joking around.
1909000	1911000	And everyone was very mad at me for not...
1911000	1912000	It was full court.
1912000	1914000	They were like, fucking get back on D.
1914000	1916000	And I was like, I thought this was fun.
1916000	1918000	I thought we were comics.
1918000	1919000	What are we doing?
1919000	1920000	I can't.
1920000	1922000	I can't get back on D.
1923000	1924000	So I quit.
1924000	1925000	I just walked off.
1925000	1926000	You did really?
1926000	1927000	Did you?
1927000	1928000	I was like, I can't.
1928000	1929000	I can't keep up with you guys.
1929000	1930000	It's like comedy store guys.
1930000	1931000	So they're good looking and funny.
1931000	1932000	Yeah.
1932000	1933000	Comedy store guys are legendarily handsome.
1933000	1934000	I mean...
1934000	1935000	The new breed of comedy store comic is...
1935000	1936000	Yeah.
1936000	1937000	I think they fall in like...
1937000	1938000	They ain't cooked.
1938000	1939000	Right.
1939000	1940000	Because they had to have a MySpace profile with a shirt off or something.
1940000	1941000	So they are.
1941000	1942000	Yeah.
1942000	1943000	Yeah.
1943000	1944000	Yeah.
1944000	1945000	Yeah.
1945000	1946000	Yeah.
1946000	1947000	Yeah.
1947000	1948000	Yeah.
1948000	1949000	Yeah.
1949000	1950000	Yeah.
1950000	1951000	Yeah.
1951000	1952000	Yeah.
1952000	1953000	Yeah.
1953000	1954000	With a shirt off or something.
1954000	1955000	So they are very good looking.
1955000	1956000	Yeah.
1956000	1957000	They're like tequila comics.
1957000	1958000	Was Dom... was Dom Herrera there?
1958000	1959000	That's what I'm talking about.
1959000	1960000	Yeah.
1960000	1961000	He's...
1961000	1962000	And he's the guy that stuck the wedding ring in his asshole.
1962000	1963000	This is...
1963000	1964000	No, it's not.
1964000	1965000	It's not Dom.
1965000	1966000	No, it's not.
1966000	1967000	It's not him.
1967000	1968000	It's not the...
1968000	1969000	It doesn't sound like the tallest team.
1969000	1970000	It was.
1970000	1971000	Really?
1971000	1972000	Yeah.
1972000	1973000	They were all...
1973000	1974000	It was shocking.
1974000	1975000	It was like they were...
1975000	1976000	It was Ringers from...
1976000	1977000	It's like Space Jam.
1977000	1978000	I don't know.
1979000	1980000	I don't understand that...
1980000	1984000	I don't know if I'm jealous or resentful or angry or intimidated.
1984000	1985000	You shouldn't be anything.
1985000	1989000	I thought for once I'm going to not only do drugs on the weekend.
1989000	1990000	Right.
1990000	1992000	And I'm going to go play basketball.
1992000	1995000	And I was like, this is why I chose my path.
1995000	1996000	Okay.
1996000	1997000	Yes.
1997000	1998000	Yeah.
1998000	1999000	Sports.
1999000	2000000	I mean, fuck you.
2000000	2001000	Yeah.
2001000	2002000	Yeah.
2002000	2003000	Yeah.
2003000	2004000	Fuck you.
2004000	2005000	Like sports...
2005000	2007000	Has anyone in this room ever lived longer by playing sports?
2007000	2008000	No.
2009000	2010000	No.
2010000	2011000	There is nobody...
2011000	2012000	That's a good point.
2012000	2014000	They're all exactly the age they are.
2014000	2015000	Yeah.
2015000	2016000	They're not in this room.
2016000	2017000	Yeah.
2017000	2018000	There is not...
2020000	2026000	Do you think by now we would have legitimately figured out, like, that if you dribbled a
2026000	2030000	basketball more than another guy, did you fucking...
2030000	2033000	Did you still get the cancers in the...
2033000	2036000	Has anybody here died of cancer because of sports?
2037000	2038000	Nobody.
2039000	2040000	It's pretty random, man.
2040000	2043000	Like, my family is a bunch of hillbillies.
2043000	2046000	You know, they just live random distances.
2046000	2048000	They just murder each other.
2048000	2053000	You know, it really is because guys in utero are flooded with testosterone.
2053000	2054000	We don't develop...
2054000	2057000	Like, I was just reading something about how women check...
2057000	2059000	Little girls check faces all the time.
2059000	2060000	And boys don't.
2060000	2061000	Oh, yeah.
2061000	2062000	Yeah.
2062000	2063000	We're not such a weak compete.
2063000	2065000	Do you think if I played sports that I would...
2065000	2067000	Because I played softball for the Starburn softball team.
2067000	2068000	Maybe I did...
2068000	2071000	Do you think that I would yell less?
2071000	2073000	I would have less...
2073000	2078000	Did you really believe that you can channel, like, a set amount of rage, energy?
2078000	2081000	Yeah, I think you'd be less funny.
2081000	2082000	I think...
2082000	2083000	You know what I mean?
2083000	2084000	I think you would.
2084000	2085000	I think it would come out.
2085000	2086000	Yeah.
2086000	2087000	So you're funny, though.
2087000	2088000	Thank you.
2088000	2089000	Yeah, when you walked off the court.
2089000	2090000	But you probably don't play sports.
2090000	2094000	I played drums and people are like, that's where you get your rage out.
2094000	2096000	It's like, that has nothing to do with that.
2096000	2099000	And also, musicians are all assholes, too.
2099000	2102000	Everyone stays angry always, I guess, is my point.
2102000	2103000	Everyone is mad.
2103000	2104000	I think so.
2104000	2106000	Harris, was there anybody on the court...
2106000	2109000	You don't have to name names, but was there anybody that was a really good basketball
2109000	2112000	player and also somebody you thought was very funny?
2112000	2113000	It was...
2113000	2115000	No, because it was a lot of, like, newer comp...
2115000	2116000	That's not an insult.
2116000	2117000	I just haven't seen a lot of...
2117000	2118000	I don't hang out at the store a lot.
2118000	2120000	So it was a lot of guys' comics I haven't seen.
2120000	2121000	The store.
2121000	2122000	The store.
2122000	2123000	The store.
2123000	2126000	It's like a fashion runway now over at the store.
2126000	2127000	Yeah.
2127000	2128000	It's not big about the jokes.
2128000	2129000	It's just about the fucking sex.
2129000	2130000	Just about how you look.
2130000	2131000	Yeah.
2131000	2132000	Just beefcake.
2132000	2133000	That's where comedy went to.
2133000	2136000	They should call it the beefcake store.
2136000	2138000	Hey, so what's the plan?
2138000	2139000	We kind of buried the lead here.
2139000	2141000	What are you going to do about the wedding?
2141000	2142000	Are you thinking about that?
2142000	2143000	Is there a date set?
2143000	2144000	I don't know.
2144000	2145000	We've been having...
2145000	2146000	No, no, we haven't set a date.
2146000	2151000	We have to have a preliminary discussion about...
2151000	2155000	First thing I've got to rule out is the possibility of a truly conceptual wedding.
2155000	2159000	Because if we're going to have one of those, then maybe equipment needs to be commissioned.
2159000	2160000	Yeah.
2160000	2164000	Isn't the point of an engagement that you can push off having to think about the wedding
2164000	2165000	for a while?
2165000	2166000	That's what I thought it was.
2166000	2167000	It's like, hey, we're engaged.
2167000	2168000	We all have to get married now.
2168000	2169000	I think you've got to start...
2169000	2170000	For a long time.
2170000	2174000	I think you've got to start looking at stuff pretty quickly.
2174000	2179000	You should have a community-themed wedding, but make it about the Porton Weissman year.
2180000	2182000	Port Gracio.
2182000	2185000	Port Gracio, sorry, yeah.
2185000	2188000	Just everything from that year.
2188000	2195000	You can say, well, it just seemed arrogant to make it about my own work.
2195000	2199000	But I've got all these great contacts.
2199000	2200000	Damn it.
2200000	2201000	They all work on the show.
2201000	2204000	You said you want to rule out a high-concept wedding?
2204000	2207000	No, I'm saying that's the first thing that needs to be eliminated before we say,
2208000	2213000	book a nice place to get married that's just a pretty place to get married.
2213000	2215000	I first want to continue to talk to Aaron.
2215000	2219000	We're workshopping in conversations about hydraulics and things.
2219000	2224000	We may need to rent an airplane hangar if we want to do something special.
2224000	2228000	And then your big celebrity doesn't show up and you get like Terry Bradshaw.
2228000	2230000	Terry Bradshaw.
2230000	2231000	You know what I mean?
2231000	2233000	Everybody I know has ever done a show.
2233000	2235000	Have you been on a show where you aim for...
2235000	2238000	I've heard that he is booked on my friend's show.
2238000	2239000	Really?
2239000	2240000	Yeah.
2240000	2243000	My friend, Lou Schneider, years ago worked on Raymond.
2243000	2244000	Everybody loves Raymond.
2244000	2246000	And he said to me, we're getting Michael Jordan.
2246000	2247000	I said, great.
2247000	2248000	Say hi to Terry Bradshaw.
2248000	2253000	And he called me two weeks later and he said, you know, I can believe he's on stage.
2253000	2254000	Terry Bradshaw.
2254000	2255000	You actually called him.
2255000	2259000	I like doing that with, not recently, but older McConaughey movies where I'm like,
2259000	2264000	I wonder who they went... who were the first four guys before it got...
2264000	2265000	And now he's like legit.
2265000	2269000	I've booked two jobs, at least maybe three, when the guy...
2269000	2272000	because a lot of people have to pass before I get a job.
2272000	2275000	And what's his name?
2275000	2280000	The quarterback from Jerry Maguire.
2280000	2281000	No, no.
2281000	2282000	Jerry McConnell.
2282000	2283000	Push Lash.
2283000	2288000	When Jerry McConnell passes, that's when I start having a chance.
2288000	2289000	Jerry O'Connell.
2289000	2290000	Jerry O'Connell.
2290000	2291000	Whatever the fuck your name is.
2291000	2292000	He's UCB trained now.
2292000	2294000	You used to do the show with Jerry O'Connell.
2294000	2295000	I didn't do.
2295000	2296000	No.
2296000	2297000	Oh, no.
2297000	2298000	Sorry.
2298000	2299000	Sorry.
2299000	2300000	No, no, no.
2300000	2301000	Of course not.
2301000	2302000	No, no, of course not.
2302000	2303000	What show?
2303000	2304000	What show?
2304000	2305000	Sorry.
2305000	2306000	It was called the Jeff Davis show.
2306000	2307000	Oh, Jesus Christ.
2307000	2309000	It didn't go anywhere.
2309000	2314000	Six episodes and it was over.
2314000	2316000	I met Jerry O'Connell.
2316000	2319000	I was just walking around with him for an afternoon at...
2319000	2322000	I think it was the Emmy Awards.
2322000	2323000	It just ended up...
2323000	2325000	but it was the Creative Arts Emmys.
2325000	2327000	And I was just walking around with him and he was...
2327000	2328000	Have you ever met him?
2328000	2329000	No, but...
2329000	2330000	All right, for a second.
2330000	2333000	Were we just walking on these old railroad tracks?
2333000	2335000	Yeah, he said, you want to see a body?
2335000	2337000	Dan, that wasn't you.
2337000	2338000	No, I just want to...
2338000	2340000	We all think we were doing that.
2340000	2342000	Was he at Stand By Me?
2342000	2343000	Yeah, yeah.
2343000	2345000	He was the fat kid at Stand By Me.
2345000	2346000	Son of a bitch.
2346000	2348000	It was between me and...
2348000	2350000	No, and what's his name?
2350000	2352000	Just a fucking Star Trek guy.
2352000	2353000	It was between...
2353000	2355000	It was up to me, him, me, Will Wheaton.
2355000	2357000	I think one other guy for that role.
2357000	2360000	And I was so young and such a terrible, terrible actor.
2360000	2361000	For real?
2361000	2362000	Yeah, we all were in a room together.
2362000	2365000	I forgot that Jerry O'Connell was in that motherfucker too.
2365000	2366000	Oh, my God.
2366000	2367000	Son of a bitch.
2367000	2368000	That's unbelievable.
2368000	2369000	I was so fired.
2369000	2371000	I was not in any place to be in that movie.
2372000	2377000	Jeff, also auditioned for the part in Monster Squad.
2377000	2379000	You read the line.
2379000	2380000	Oh, yeah.
2380000	2382000	I was watching Monster Squad and I remember seeing the movie like,
2382000	2383000	oh, this sounds so funny.
2383000	2386000	I read the line, Wolfman has Nards.
2386000	2388000	That was in the audition.
2388000	2390000	That's why you didn't get the part because the line is,
2390000	2391000	Wolfman's got Nards.
2391000	2395000	But you were like, the Wolfman has Nards.
2395000	2399000	Yes, I used to be from Transylvania.
2399000	2400000	I have terrible heartburn.
2400000	2402000	Let's bring out Camille Nagiani.
2407000	2408000	Hello.
2408000	2410000	Hello.
2410000	2414000	There's too many celebrities on the stage right now.
2414000	2415000	Yeah, yeah.
2415000	2417000	This is ruining the podcast for me.
2417000	2420000	I listen every episode, I think.
2420000	2421000	I can't listen to this one now.
2421000	2423000	My week is fucked.
2423000	2424000	Because I'm in it.
2424000	2426000	Once you're here, it's fucked up to the reality.
2426000	2428000	It seemed like it was about Camille for a second.
2428000	2429000	What the fuck, bro?
2429000	2433000	You're getting a lot of pomp and store attitude right now.
2433000	2437000	It's like Camille's here, that Russian guy's probably here.
2437000	2438000	There he is.
2438000	2439000	That's him.
2439000	2440000	It's like Oz.
2440000	2441000	Yeah.
2441000	2444000	No, I can't listen to it because when I'm on it, I can't listen to it.
2444000	2445000	What?
2445000	2447000	Johnny O'Connell, by the way, you're going to hate this.
2447000	2448000	He's a great guy.
2448000	2449000	Oh, no.
2449000	2450000	I met him.
2450000	2451000	That's what I was going to say.
2451000	2454000	He's got this delightful canine personality.
2454000	2455000	He reminds me of...
2455000	2459000	That sounds punitive because dogs are lower life forms.
2459000	2460000	I don't mean...
2460000	2462000	The thing that you...
2462000	2466000	He just has this abundant energy and unconditional love.
2466000	2467000	He's fun.
2467000	2468000	I didn't know.
2468000	2471000	I think he actually came to my birthday party one time.
2471000	2474000	Wait, he was trying to replace you at your birthday party?
2474000	2475000	Yeah.
2475000	2478000	It's fucking O'Connell.
2478000	2483000	Jerry Miner, our friend, was on carpoolers with him and he just showed up.
2483000	2484000	He was a nicest guy.
2484000	2485000	Yeah.
2485000	2486000	No problem.
2486000	2489000	And handsome enough to be a comedy store comedian.
2489000	2491000	Wait, Harris, you're saying he's UCB now?
2491000	2492000	He's an improviser?
2492000	2493000	Oh, he's trained.
2493000	2495000	He's coming after me at all fucking angles right now.
2495000	2496000	That's what's going on.
2496000	2497000	Goddammit.
2497000	2502000	He's going to be the comptroller of Hurwitz town.
2502000	2505000	Hurwaberg.
2505000	2506000	Fucking please do that.
2506000	2509000	Please have Jerry O'Connell and you do a podcast.
2509000	2512000	But have it just be about taking mine down.
2512000	2514000	That's all you ever talk about.
2514000	2517000	And how great the season four of Community is?
2517000	2520000	Constantly quoting it.
2520000	2527000	My mom sent me a Facebook message apologizing for saying she liked season four because she
2527000	2531000	read in some interview that I threw her under the bus.
2531000	2540000	Did you say you don't remember her saying that because you got changnesia?
2541000	2542000	Season four reference.
2542000	2547000	That was very quickly swept under the rug, unceremoniously.
2547000	2552000	Literally he could have looked into the camera and gone, no, that was a bunch of bullshit.
2552000	2555000	I thought it was great.
2558000	2561000	Well, it wasn't out of judgment for any of the canon.
2561000	2565000	It was just out of judgment for the tonnage of it.
2565000	2569000	We just had to get things back on track.
2569000	2572000	I'm very excited for next week's episode.
2572000	2576000	I thought the first two episodes were so great.
2576000	2578000	Yeah, yeah, guys.
2578000	2579000	Thanks.
2579000	2580000	Thanks.
2580000	2581000	Hey.
2588000	2590000	Thanks, guys.
2590000	2593000	I don't know how to take a compliment.
2593000	2594000	See that?
2594000	2595000	Well, that was...
2595000	2596000	Yeah.
2596000	2597000	Yeah.
2597000	2598000	Thanks, everybody.
2599000	2602000	You turned into a terrible SNL audition character.
2602000	2604000	Yeah.
2605000	2608000	I wish Chevy Chase walked out during that applause.
2608000	2610000	That would have been the greatest thing.
2610000	2612000	We can get Chevy on the show now, right?
2612000	2613000	Now it's okay.
2613000	2614000	On this show?
2614000	2616000	Yeah, you said you don't want to, right?
2616000	2618000	Well, no.
2618000	2620000	He's welcome here.
2622000	2625000	I thought he has no recollection of the show at this point.
2625000	2627000	He had to keep me very confused.
2627000	2629000	We had Lorraine Newman on.
2629000	2630000	You haven't had Chevy on.
2630000	2631000	That's hilarious.
2631000	2633000	Well, I don't have a lot of community people on
2633000	2635000	because I want to reserve the right to complain
2635000	2642000	when gossip articles attribute the show's hilarious antics to,
2642000	2644000	you know...
2644000	2645000	But whatever.
2645000	2647000	That's dumb because people are going to do what they want.
2647000	2649000	So I should have the gang come down.
2653000	2654000	Yeah.
2654000	2656000	And I thought the actors felt...
2656000	2659000	They've always been fantastic, but they felt like re-energized.
2659000	2660000	Yeah.
2660000	2661000	Well, I mean, they're so...
2661000	2662000	God damn it.
2662000	2663000	They work so hard.
2663000	2665000	They're so loyal, so dedicated.
2665000	2669000	I'm really excited about what Donald Glover's...
2669000	2671000	What that thing's going to be.
2671000	2672000	Not to bring it down.
2672000	2673000	Yeah.
2673000	2675000	I think if I was done editing it and I could tell you...
2675000	2678000	I could give it a letter grade for you, but I have no idea.
2678000	2680000	I mean, it's like...
2680000	2683000	At the end of the episode where he leaves, you did like...
2683000	2685000	Tears everywhere.
2685000	2687000	Like, uncontrollably.
2687000	2689000	It's unavoidable.
2689000	2691000	But...
2691000	2693000	What the hell is it going to make it funny?
2693000	2695000	I would just cut that stuff out.
2699000	2702000	Don't worry about it. It's the main thing.
2708000	2709000	Can I say something?
2709000	2711000	Just sort of change the topic you're getting...
2711000	2713000	I was...
2714000	2717000	You're getting married, and that's very exciting.
2717000	2718000	And I don't want to...
2718000	2719000	So I was at...
2719000	2721000	I just want to tell you this quick story.
2721000	2724000	It's an incredibly ominous beginning to this story.
2724000	2727000	Well, I'm just really hoping that Emily's not here anymore,
2727000	2730000	because we were at her house for Christmas,
2730000	2733000	and her mother-in-law, who I love and is a wonderful woman,
2733000	2739000	insisted that LeBron James was Kanye West
2739000	2742000	during a basketball game.
2742000	2745000	I haven't seen the two of them in a room together.
2745000	2749000	Wait, she said that he has an alter ego?
2749000	2751000	No, she was like, that's Kanye West.
2751000	2753000	And his stats were up.
2753000	2756000	So I was like, not only did you think Kanye plays in the NBA,
2756000	2760000	but also that he shocked 60% from the field this time.
2763000	2767000	There's a Delonte West in the NBA who had sex with LeBron James' mother.
2767000	2769000	Which is great.
2769000	2771000	Is that confirmed? That's a great story.
2771000	2774000	Yeah, confirmed. Otherwise, it'd be fighting words.
2774000	2776000	That's how you know.
2776000	2777000	Stop talking about sports.
2777000	2780000	Oh! Okay.
2780000	2783000	She also...
2783000	2785000	They were talking about fucking.
2785000	2786000	They were talking about fucking.
2786000	2788000	It's about fucking, bro.
2788000	2793000	She also referred to Will Smith as Jada Pinkett's husband.
2793000	2796000	She's like, what was that movie that Jada Pinkett's husband...
2796000	2798000	We were like, Will Smith?
2799000	2801000	She's the most feminist racist of all time.
2801000	2802000	Yeah.
2802000	2806000	Even Jada's mom is like, I was hanging out with Will Smith's wife today.
2806000	2810000	Did you watch David Blaine show magic to the Smith family?
2810000	2812000	No, no.
2812000	2814000	Yeah, that was fantastic.
2814000	2819000	Speaking of tears, he did one trick and it made all of the Smiths cry.
2819000	2822000	Literally, Jada was crying, Jaden was crying.
2822000	2825000	Because they believe in magic.
2825000	2827000	And now Donald Glover is gone.
2828000	2830000	It always gets them.
2830000	2831000	I like the one...
2831000	2832000	Always gets tears.
2832000	2835000	I saw a clip that someone sent me on YouTube where for some reason...
2835000	2836000	Harrison Ford?
2836000	2839000	Yeah, he's in Harrison Ford's kitchen and he pulls a thing out of an orange
2839000	2841000	and Harrison Ford just tells him to fuck off.
2841000	2843000	He goes, get the fuck out of my house.
2843000	2844000	Get the fuck out of my house.
2844000	2846000	Which is kind of like Air Force One.
2846000	2848000	Yeah, get off of my kitchen.
2848000	2852000	My wife, my kids.
2852000	2856000	Do you guys have any opinion about buffet roast beef?
2856000	2858000	Like the way that it's...
2858000	2859000	Whoa!
2859000	2861000	That's one guy left, by the way.
2861000	2862000	Big opinions.
2862000	2863000	Big opinions over there.
2863000	2865000	Tyler just left.
2865000	2869000	I was talking to Aaron about this and this is the one note I came back with
2869000	2870000	from Europe.
2870000	2871000	I was just looking at my Evernote thing.
2871000	2872000	That's the one thing I wrote.
2872000	2875000	It said, roast beef in a buffet is for grownups.
2878000	2883000	I feel very uncomfortable when you go up and there's a guy with the hat and the...
2883000	2884000	And he's carving it?
2885000	2887000	And then he's like, what would you like?
2887000	2889000	And I'm like, I don't know.
2889000	2892000	Why haven't you finished before I got here?
2892000	2896000	Well, you have to kind of pretend that what he's doing takes some real skill.
2896000	2901000	Just that one little piece, that exact same quarter inch, you're slicing for everybody.
2901000	2902000	It's also like, thank you.
2902000	2903000	Nice.
2903000	2907000	Well, see Dan, you won't be surprised to know that I grew up in a family that has
2907000	2909000	prime rib buffet opinions.
2909000	2910000	Oh, really?
2910000	2913000	My mom and dad would actually say, I would rather...
2913000	2914000	Give me that part.
2914000	2915000	Give me that part.
2915000	2918000	They come at it and go, I want the this or the that and they have names for it.
2918000	2921000	But sometimes there's chicken or turkey and they go, you want white meat or dark meat?
2921000	2923000	I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, man.
2923000	2924000	I don't work under that hood.
2924000	2925000	Just feed me.
2929000	2930000	I'm a writer.
2933000	2936000	Different kinds of meat on the same animal?
2936000	2938000	White meat is way better.
2938000	2940000	Well, that's inaccurate.
2940000	2941000	Oh, you like brown meat?
2942000	2944000	White meat is dry and shitty.
2944000	2946000	Oh, fuck off.
2946000	2947000	No.
2947000	2949000	Get the fuck out of my picture.
2949000	2953000	I think they're confused because I think in a lot of Indian restaurants they have
2953000	2955000	white meat.
2955000	2957000	More than dark meat.
2962000	2966000	Thanksgiving, I just get like the stuffing and the mac and cheese.
2966000	2967000	I don't even...
2967000	2968000	I secretly...
2968000	2970000	People are always like, you gotta try the turkey.
2970000	2971000	I spend all the time on the turkey.
2971000	2972000	Fuck you.
2972000	2974000	Tough titties for spending time on turkey.
2974000	2978000	So you weren't eating turkey on Thanksgiving and someone said, maybe you should try the
2978000	2980000	turkey and then you got mad.
2980000	2984000	And someone was like, have the turkey on Thanksgiving.
2984000	2987000	Dad, you started this by saying this is a European, UK thing.
2987000	2990000	Is that the first time you've encountered the guy in the hat?
2990000	2993000	No, I was just talking to Erin about it so I thumbed it into my phone because she was
2993000	2994000	bewildered.
2994000	2995000	She's like, what are you talking about?
2995000	2996000	Roast beef is grown up food.
2996000	2997000	What does that mean?
2997000	3003000	You're 41 and I was like, yeah, but it's just like my brain shuts off when I see the cutting
3003000	3008000	board with the juice and there's like a half cut shank of something and the guy's like,
3008000	3012000	he's going to cut the meat for you and you're going to participate.
3012000	3013000	It's so...
3013000	3018000	I don't like the look where they act like they're hooking you up.
3020000	3026000	I always feel like it's possible to do it wrong.
3026000	3029000	Because it would be so absurd to answer honestly.
3029000	3030000	What would you like?
3030000	3032000	Roast beef!
3032000	3033000	Roast beef!
3033000	3035000	What are you talking about?
3035000	3038000	Just yell that at him.
3040000	3042000	Roast beef I want.
3042000	3044000	Not anymore.
3044000	3046000	Not like this.
3046000	3048000	I don't want it.
3048000	3049000	You don't live in that hood.
3049000	3052000	It's like close up magic or something all of a sudden.
3053000	3055000	When's your birthday?
3055000	3058000	Do you want to hear a story about three kings?
3061000	3063000	Why didn't they cut it before I got there?
3063000	3066000	Have you ever eaten at Lowry's?
3066000	3067000	Yeah.
3067000	3068000	It's very good.
3068000	3069000	Roast beef.
3069000	3071000	Well, Taylor Shanter is one of my favorites.
3071000	3072000	That's at Lowry's.
3072000	3073000	Yeah, that is.
3073000	3075000	Sometimes I'll say I'd like you to just cut a hole right in the middle.
3075000	3077000	I just want that.
3077000	3079000	Or just point at his leg.
3079000	3081000	Give me that.
3081000	3082000	I've been vegetarian forever.
3082000	3087000	When I was a kid, I found out that I liked the end of it because it's the salty part.
3087000	3088000	Yeah, they put all the seasoning.
3088000	3090000	But you can't just say to that guy.
3090000	3091000	Yes, you can.
3091000	3092000	It's right over there.
3092000	3093000	That's why he's asking.
3093000	3094000	Give me the edge.
3094000	3095000	Give me the top.
3095000	3096000	Give me the thing.
3096000	3098000	Well, that just confirms my suspicion that there's all this.
3098000	3101000	It's like getting into a flight simulator.
3101000	3102000	Give me the edge.
3102000	3103000	Give me the top.
3103000	3107000	That would be a cool proposal, though, is put the ring in the fucking hunk of beef.
3107000	3108000	Hey, get the top.
3108000	3109000	Yeah, you have to tell her.
3109000	3110000	The top.
3110000	3111000	I didn't.
3111000	3117000	I took till I was like 35 years old to come to terms with the fact that it's haircutting's
3117000	3122000	fault that I'm intimidated when I sit in that chair as a science.
3122000	3129000	It's a dumb activity getting my hair cut.
3129000	3134000	When I sit in the chair and someone's got a pair of scissors, obviously I want my hair
3134000	3135000	shorter.
3135000	3137000	I don't know how else to say it.
3137000	3140000	This isn't a ticket that I wanted to buy.
3140000	3144000	I don't have a headshot of someone that I want to look like.
3144000	3145000	I don't know the terminology.
3145000	3146000	Do any of you take dark people?
3146000	3147000	I don't know.
3147000	3149000	Winds are not above my left ear.
3149000	3155000	I want to feather the doofus and put a duck tail on the widow's peak.
3155000	3159000	I would love it if there's an episode of Community This Season where Jeff is like, what the fuck
3159000	3163000	is it with haircuts and roast beef?
3163000	3164000	It's so intimidating.
3164000	3166000	It's not the conversation you don't like, the photos.
3166000	3167000	I don't like cutting things.
3167000	3168000	You don't like cutting things?
3168000	3169000	Is that?
3169000	3170000	No, no.
3170000	3175000	It's that moment of exchange between you and some kind of threshold guardian.
3175000	3177000	Or some kind of expert.
3177000	3178000	A professional.
3178000	3181000	A professional across chairs.
3181000	3188000	But someone who hasn't adopted as part of their craft, meeting you halfway as a layman,
3188000	3194000	because they cut people's hair who do care about hair terminology, when you go, I don't
3194000	3198000	know, they're like, why don't you know, you monster?
3198000	3200000	Where do you get your haircut?
3200000	3203000	Just make it look like me about two months ago.
3203000	3205000	That is actually what I say.
3205000	3208000	He gets his haircut at Dick's Last Resort.
3208000	3211000	What's that place?
3211000	3214000	It's that restaurant in Florida that yells at you.
3214000	3218000	But I finally just started saying, my answer to the question now is I just tell him about
3218000	3219000	my average day.
3219000	3221000	And I go, let me tell you how this is going to work.
3221000	3224000	Like, no matter what you do in here, here's how I'm going to treat my hair.
3224000	3225000	I'm going to go to sleep.
3225000	3227000	I'm going to wake up and go to work.
3227000	3229000	I drive with the windows down.
3229000	3233000	You need to know that.
3233000	3238000	It's not going to get washed until the next time you see me.
3238000	3239000	Just make it short.
3239000	3241000	It's amazing we don't have wigs.
3241000	3244000	Not like the powdered wigs that people used to wear.
3244000	3249000	But I could totally see a Los Angeles where you're wearing the Tom Cruise.
3249000	3250000	You know what I mean?
3250000	3251000	And men just...
3251000	3255000	I'm wearing the Indian restaurant.
3255000	3256000	I'm wearing the John Marrero.
3256000	3259000	You've kind of got the Seth Meyers.
3259000	3261000	I was going to get that.
3261000	3263000	I was going to get the Seth Meyers.
3263000	3265000	We can't all have the Seth Meyers.
3265000	3266000	You know what I mean?
3266000	3267000	Like, everyone with, like, cards.
3267000	3269000	Like, there's six kinds.
3269000	3275000	The only reason you can see my ears is because as an actor I played, like, doctors and cops
3275000	3276000	and shit like that.
3276000	3277000	If I weren't an actor, I'd have...
3277000	3279000	I looked like Tom Kiefer from Cinderella.
3279000	3283000	I've had fucking big, like, Keith Richard Altamont hair.
3283000	3284000	That's what I would have.
3284000	3286000	Wait, what is the Cinderella thing you just said?
3286000	3288000	Tom Kiefer's the lead singer of Cinderella.
3288000	3289000	Oh, the band.
3289000	3290000	Yeah.
3290000	3291000	Look him up.
3291000	3292000	He's got fucking...
3292000	3293000	Yeah, that's what most people think when they hear Cinderella.
3293000	3296000	They go, oh, the band we grew up with.
3296000	3299000	They love this band.
3299000	3301000	The true Cinderella fans know who I'm talking about.
3301000	3302000	Yeah, I'm sure they...
3302000	3304000	Cinderella, by the way, fucking...
3304000	3308000	If they play, go fucking see them because they'll kick your dick in through your butt.
3308000	3309000	That doesn't sound good.
3309000	3312000	I think I saw them...
3312000	3314000	Do they do the Main Street electrocorporate?
3314000	3316000	Because I saw...
3316000	3318000	I think I saw who you're talking about.
3318000	3321000	I saw a lot of guys with dicks coming out of their butts.
3321000	3323000	They were big, light blue hoop dresses.
3323000	3324000	Right.
3324000	3327000	And there's usually a bear or some sort of animal walking in front of them just kicking
3327000	3329000	the dick into every little kid.
3329000	3330000	They do their butt.
3330000	3331000	I know that.
3331000	3332000	I know that.
3332000	3334000	You shit out your own dick.
3334000	3338000	And they serve a prime rib that will just fucking...
3338000	3340000	Is there an extra mic back there?
3340000	3342000	Because it would be nice to bring Steve Agee out.
3342000	3344000	Steve Agee.
3346000	3348000	I saw him in the green room.
3348000	3350000	Is he still here?
3350000	3351000	Here.
3351000	3352000	No, don't miss.
3352000	3354000	Steve Agee, everything.
3354000	3357000	No, that's where Spencer's going to sit.
3357000	3359000	Just let Steve hover.
3359000	3361000	I can just share.
3361000	3363000	I'll share.
3363000	3366000	I hope you didn't think I came just assuming...
3366000	3369000	We get it, Steve. You're here.
3369000	3372000	Camille's podcast and was hanging out.
3372000	3373000	No, no.
3373000	3375000	When I see people in the green room, I don't go,
3375000	3377000	ugh, they want to be on the show.
3377000	3378000	It's my choice.
3378000	3379000	Oh, okay.
3379000	3381000	I'm back and I'm sick.
3381000	3383000	I'm not very charismatic, so I thought,
3383000	3387000	let's just bring up a Mount Rushmore of a parent.
3387000	3388000	You say you're sick, though,
3388000	3391000	but you got pretty vehement and emotional during the prank.
3392000	3393000	That's probably how it comes out.
3393000	3396000	Well, I just, yeah, I mean, I have ire.
3396000	3398000	I'm just going to sit here so you can have that seat.
3398000	3400000	Until, all right.
3400000	3402000	That buffet that we went to,
3402000	3404000	we were driving back from Inverness where Loch Ness is,
3404000	3406000	and we were driving back down to Edinburgh,
3406000	3407000	and we stopped at a place called House of Brewer,
3407000	3410000	which is like the outlet mall for Scottish things.
3410000	3413000	And that was a good buffet.
3413000	3416000	They got French fries right at a buffet.
3416000	3418000	The chips, they were fucking off the deep end.
3418000	3420000	I was sitting out in the cold, and Aaron wanted to...
3420000	3422000	She didn't like her food, so she wanted to get a sandwich.
3422000	3424000	I got mad at her because I felt like my mommy
3424000	3425000	abandoned me in the cold.
3425000	3427000	I was freezing.
3427000	3428000	I know. It's really romantic.
3428000	3430000	It's going to, you know...
3430000	3432000	I'm a great, great husband.
3432000	3434000	But I was like...
3434000	3436000	And then I was kind of like, oh, you left me out here.
3436000	3439000	Searching your sandwich, you barely...
3439000	3442000	And then I was taking my tray,
3442000	3445000	and I went up to the door, and I was opening it,
3445000	3448000	and then the diet coke that was on the tray toppled off,
3448000	3450000	and I went, goddamn it!
3450000	3452000	Like that.
3452000	3456000	And it was such a disturbance to the European Old World
3456000	3460000	melanist, like all these guys in those little checkered flat caps.
3460000	3462000	Oh, damn it!
3462000	3465000	But this guy right next to where I did it,
3465000	3467000	he's sitting with his wife eating his chips,
3467000	3469000	and I said, goddamn it!
3469000	3471000	I started picking up the coke bottle,
3471000	3475000	and without looking at him, I just said, sorry.
3475000	3479000	And he said, it's all right.
3479000	3482000	It can't be helped.
3482000	3484000	Aw.
3484000	3488000	At an American buffet, it's just people throwing handfuls of noodles
3488000	3490000	and yelling, goddamn it!
3490000	3493000	Have you been to the soup plantation? That's all it is.
3493000	3496000	There's people fighting for a last potato.
3496000	3498000	When I was broke in college, I used to go to the soup plantation
3498000	3500000	at the Beverly Connection, which I think is gone now
3500000	3502000	across from the Beverly Center,
3502000	3504000	and I would just eat there for free.
3504000	3506000	I would just kind of steal my way in.
3506000	3508000	I would go in, and normally you get a plate,
3508000	3510000	go to the salad bar, and you pay,
3510000	3513000	and walk into the inner sanctum where there's pizzas and muffins.
3513000	3515000	Camille, would you grab a fucking plate?
3515000	3517000	I'm sorry. I can't find a spot to be at
3517000	3519000	where I'm not blocking someone, so this is good.
3519000	3520000	This is good.
3520000	3522000	Oh, no, no, no, no. Keep it. Thank you, Adam.
3522000	3524000	Thank you.
3524000	3525000	Great.
3525000	3526000	Okay.
3526000	3528000	And what I used to do is I would go in there,
3528000	3530000	and I would just walk past them with a book,
3530000	3532000	and I would go in, and I would find somebody who had left
3532000	3534000	like empty plates, and I would just sit there
3534000	3536000	and read my book for a while, and they would come up
3536000	3538000	and say, more iced tea, because it would be like a nice tea,
3538000	3541000	and I'd go, sure thing, and then after about a half hour,
3541000	3543000	I'd get up, and I would just resume eating,
3543000	3544000	and I went there so...
3544000	3546000	How smart of the system, man.
3546000	3549000	I went there so often, I knew all of their names,
3549000	3552000	and they knew my name, and they would give me a little...
3552000	3554000	We made some fresh cookies, Jeff. Here you are.
3554000	3556000	And I stopped stealing from the soup plantation
3556000	3558000	because I felt bad.
3558000	3559000	Wow.
3559000	3561000	I went there the other day, and Jerry O'Connell was hanging out.
3561000	3563000	God damn it!
3563000	3566000	What's a soup plantation a play on?
3566000	3567000	Have you thought about that for more than...
3567000	3569000	It feels like it's racist.
3569000	3571000	It sounds racist. I mean, we hear that.
3571000	3573000	Well, they took out the cotton bar.
3573000	3576000	They used to have a whole thing where you would help yourself
3576000	3580000	to cotton as you went in.
3580000	3584000	It was pick your own mail.
3584000	3587000	They would whip you while you were making your play.
3587000	3590000	Yeah, they would weigh your bag, and if it wasn't big enough,
3591000	3594000	that's actually what did used to happen.
3594000	3597000	Twelve types of lettuce.
3597000	3600000	That is what used to happen.
3600000	3602000	Speaking of which, it's nice, by the way,
3602000	3605000	to come back to our melting pot country.
3605000	3607000	I don't doubt that there are parts of...
3607000	3610000	I mean, I know having been to London that you wouldn't...
3610000	3612000	You're like in New York or L.A.
3612000	3614000	There are terms of ethnic cross-section.
3614000	3617000	But other parts of the U.K., man, you're like...
3618000	3621000	In Scotland, I saw absolutely four black people.
3621000	3623000	We were there for two weeks.
3623000	3625000	And I stay without shame. I fucking counted.
3625000	3627000	I counted because it was weird.
3627000	3629000	No, when I saw a black person there, it was exhilarating.
3629000	3633000	Because I was like, holy shit, you're not named Craig.
3633000	3635000	It was very exciting.
3635000	3638000	Not only is it wonderful to just see a bunch of brown faces again,
3638000	3646000	but it's also nice to see all of the mutt white faces.
3646000	3650000	All of us of European descent, we're still all fucking snaggled
3650000	3653000	and mixed up.
3653000	3657000	Over there, they look like action figures of British people.
3657000	3661000	You can kind of feel the...
3661000	3663000	The inbreeding in that.
3663000	3665000	No, I'm not even kidding.
3665000	3668000	Any group that stays kind of homogenized.
3668000	3670000	I don't want to say inbreeding...
3670000	3672000	There's some big dudes in Scotland.
3672000	3674000	I'm just shy of 6-4.
3674000	3676000	There are some giant motherfuckers out there.
3676000	3678000	We went into a pub where people...
3678000	3683000	It must have been next to some shark-punching factory.
3683000	3685000	And they were on lunch break.
3685000	3689000	Okay, Dan, speaking of House of Brewer and the buffet thing,
3689000	3691000	the night before...
3691000	3695000	We picked up kilts to wear over Hagmanet in New Year's Eve.
3695000	3698000	What does Hagmanet mean? Is it like a pig thing?
3698000	3699000	No.
3699000	3701000	I'm not doing a bird.
3701000	3705000	It's a Scots-kilt word, I think, for their New Year's celebration.
3705000	3708000	We got kilts. We rented them.
3708000	3711000	And it only occurred to me, like, after we'd rented them...
3711000	3713000	Actually, right before we'd rented them,
3713000	3716000	you're renting a piece of fabric where you're not allowed to wear underwear.
3716000	3718000	Like, properly.
3718000	3720000	So, I was like, well, your dick's going to be revving up
3720000	3723000	against the front of a thing that has been revved against countless dicks.
3723000	3725000	But I thought, Nausea, you're sitting down on some...
3725000	3727000	Like, that's just countless assholes on that too.
3727000	3729000	You might be more worried about the asshole.
3729000	3730000	Yeah, none of that occurred to me.
3730000	3733000	Also, and you might be wearing it backwards.
3736000	3739000	Which is really... Well, I wore it sideways.
3739000	3743000	But when you wear it close, it's not like your asshole is rubbing on the clothes, right?
3743000	3744000	I'm just saying, you sit down and...
3744000	3745000	Do you have an Audi?
3745000	3747000	You have a naked...
3750000	3752000	Yes, I do.
3752000	3755000	I'm just saying, naked ass against fabric...
3755000	3759000	There's that old saying, if you're going to rent a kilt, wear it sideways.
3759000	3760000	Yeah, that's right.
3763000	3766000	My girlfriend is Scottish, and she insisted that you can't wear knickers,
3766000	3768000	so it lets you have a pussy.
3768000	3770000	And so, we're not wearing...
3770000	3774000	You didn't wear yours in the morning in Vernes, but Matt Gorley and I, we flashed her...
3774000	3779000	She said, you got to go out to Loch Ness and flash your balls at Nessie.
3779000	3780000	I go, oh, so we did it.
3780000	3782000	We took a picture of us flashing our...
3782000	3785000	Really, me and Matt Gorley, my friends from seventh grade, just flashing our...
3785000	3788000	Nessie's going to look a lot like my dad in the bushes with them.
3790000	3794000	But we did that, and there's people, there's families kind of near us,
3794000	3797000	not facing our dicks and balls, but around.
3797000	3800000	I'm like, is that kind of a corny, touristy thing to do?
3800000	3802000	She's like, no, I just made that up.
3802000	3803000	So, we did that.
3805000	3808000	I'm driving back to Three-Hour Ride from Inverness back to Edinburgh,
3808000	3811000	and we stop at House of Brewer to get lunch and go shopping and stuff,
3811000	3815000	and I got my kilt on, and there was a glass awesomely at a place that sells kilts.
3815000	3818000	There's a glass stairway, a glass spiral staircase.
3819000	3820000	Oh, my God.
3820000	3822000	What a nightmare.
3822000	3825000	To get from one part of the fucking House of Brewer to the restaurant,
3825000	3828000	you have to go down that staircase, I learned.
3828000	3830000	And there's fucking families down there.
3830000	3833000	And I was like, like, fucking went and grown, baby.
3833000	3835000	Like, I fucking did it.
3835000	3837000	But I learned something about...
3837000	3839000	And I learned this the hard way.
3839000	3841000	I'm not circumcised, and most people in Scotland...
3841000	3842000	That's how you learn?
3842000	3843000	No, no, no, no.
3843000	3847000	Do someone like, why is there a tremor in your kilt?
3847000	3849000	I caught my reflection in the glass.
3849000	3851000	Oh, shit.
3851000	3852000	And I misspoke.
3852000	3853000	I am circumcised.
3853000	3854000	I am circumcised.
3854000	3858000	And most Scotsmen are not.
3858000	3862000	You want to not be circumcised wearing a fucking kilt,
3862000	3864000	because that wool is a scrubby.
3864000	3868000	I have a fucking abrasion on my cock right now from wearing that thing.
3868000	3871000	You've got to stop getting turchin under there.
3871000	3873000	I wasn't, but the sporing...
3873000	3876000	My wiener just turns into, like, a nipple.
3876000	3877000	Especially in that kind of cold.
3877000	3880000	It just recedes into me like an octopus cup, you know?
3880000	3881000	And yet, because of that...
3881000	3885000	See, I could use my dick to rob a skyscraper like a cat burglar.
3885000	3887000	I could...
3887000	3889000	If I had another one, I guess.
3889000	3890000	You'd need another dick.
3890000	3893000	Your dick didn't get rubbed in the thing?
3893000	3895000	No, I'm telling you, it recedes.
3895000	3900000	There are growers and showers, and then there's old camera here.
3900000	3902000	Schedules.
3902000	3903000	Toddlers.
3903000	3905000	Schedules.
3906000	3908000	Matt and I both have the same experience,
3908000	3910000	but you have the sporing which holds your keys and your phone,
3910000	3912000	and you should have a hip flask in there.
3912000	3914000	So it's always kind of just rubbing...
3914000	3917000	It holds your little tinkle down, yeah.
3917000	3919000	Your little tinkle?
3919000	3923000	Or your big, giant tinkle, Jeff.
3923000	3924000	It kind of...
3924000	3929000	Yeah, it applies a little bit of pressure to your wiener.
3929000	3930000	Wait, what is this?
3930000	3932000	It kind of holds your kilt down.
3932000	3935000	The whole furry bit that hangs down.
3935000	3937000	Oh, the big locket thing?
3937000	3939000	The big man purse that holds your...
3939000	3942000	It's an ancient Highlander fanny pack.
3942000	3944000	It's a great fucking thing.
3944000	3945000	I know, it's amazing.
3945000	3947000	Can I put my wallet and phone in here,
3947000	3950000	or am I haunting their ancestors by doing that?
3950000	3954000	I don't want to do something gauche as ambassador of my country,
3954000	3956000	but yeah, you put your phone and your wallet in there.
3956000	3959000	You've got to cut a hole and put your tinkle in there.
3959000	3961000	Your little tinkle?
3962000	3965000	It's the worst thing I've ever heard.
3965000	3967000	Where else are you going to put the tic-tac?
3967000	3969000	You know what I mean?
3969000	3971000	You've got to put it...
3971000	3972000	What?
3972000	3977000	Did you guys in high school tuck under the waistband?
3979000	3980000	High school?
3980000	3981000	When you had boners?
3981000	3982000	Yeah.
3982000	3983000	You have to tuck.
3983000	3984000	It's so crazy.
3984000	3986000	Sometimes I had to do that.
3987000	3991000	Yeah, I really had to break a record in order for it to have that kind of...
3991000	3994000	If we're ever out of high school, just keep in mind that every guy there has a...
3994000	3996000	Are you talking about your own waistband?
3996000	3997000	Yes.
3998000	4000000	I just have a beat behind.
4000000	4001000	Yeah.
4001000	4002000	Yeah.
4002000	4003000	Principal... waistband.
4003000	4005000	What are you talking about?
4005000	4007000	It's a real name of a principal.
4007000	4009000	We should not... we've got to cut that.
4009000	4010000	We don't want to...
4010000	4011000	Principal...
4013000	4014000	Now we're saying it.
4015000	4016000	All right.
4016000	4020000	My high school principal is named Leo Kamalich.
4020000	4021000	Kamalich?
4021000	4022000	Kamalich.
4022000	4024000	It was pretty funny when you were in high school.
4024000	4025000	Did he ever get made fun of?
4025000	4027000	You betcha.
4027000	4030000	Shrob had a gym teacher named Mr. Reamer.
4031000	4037000	We had someone named Ms. Dickey who was dating our band teacher named Mr. Titsworth.
4037000	4038000	Ms. Titsworth?
4038000	4040000	At Lanier Middle School in Houston, Texas.
4040000	4043000	Titsworth and Ms. Dickey were hooking up.
4043000	4044000	Titsworth?
4044000	4045000	There's no way.
4045000	4047000	I didn't... no one wrote that.
4047000	4051000	You know when your family name is Titsworth that somewhere in the past your family saved
4051000	4055000	the king's life because otherwise you would be weeded out.
4055000	4056000	Now wait a minute.
4056000	4058000	We're Titsworths.
4058000	4059000	We teach.
4059000	4061000	That's what we do.
4061000	4062000	We do two things.
4062000	4065000	We save kings and we teach English.
4065000	4071000	A guy came to our high school when I was a senior from the Princeton Review to talk about
4071000	4072000	preparing for the SATs.
4072000	4074000	And his name was Dick Morehead.
4074000	4078000	And we didn't hear a fucking... we didn't hear a thing he said for two hours.
4078000	4082000	No one's ever heard anything he's ever said.
4082000	4085000	He gets to be president just because he's...
4085000	4086000	Actually it's Richard.
4086000	4087000	I go by Richard.
4087000	4088000	All right.
4088000	4089000	Whatever.
4089000	4093000	It was Richard but we connected those dots.
4093000	4095000	Do we settle the roast beef thing?
4095000	4096000	I feel like we totally...
4096000	4098000	You know what I don't like about it?
4098000	4102000	I don't like if my food resembles an animal in any way.
4102000	4104000	That's why I don't eat fish because it looks still like the animal.
4104000	4105000	Is that what it is?
4105000	4107000	Like you see the bones and fucking things in there?
4107000	4108000	No.
4108000	4110000	He doesn't like the idea that there's a right or wrong way to eat roast beef.
4110000	4113000	And I don't like social interaction at a buffet.
4113000	4115000	Like I don't want to...
4115000	4117000	When they ask you what type of meat...
4117000	4119000	People acting like professionals about ridiculous...
4119000	4121000	I mean these are guys that used to build dams.
4121000	4122000	You know what I mean?
4122000	4127000	Like these are the same people that would have built skyscrapers in the 30s, you know?
4127000	4128000	Yeah.
4128000	4129000	I don't know.
4129000	4130000	Yeah.
4130000	4131000	I just don't...
4131000	4132000	I get uncomfortable.
4132000	4136000	When I'm talking to somebody, okay, I am in a crisis mode.
4136000	4140000	Like if somebody comes up to me after the show...
4140000	4141000	Don't do this.
4141000	4144000	I'll give you a scotch flu.
4144000	4147000	But when someone comes up to me and says,
4147000	4150000	Hello, my name is so and so.
4150000	4151000	It's nice to meet you.
4151000	4155000	Like I'm barely hearing like 5% of that.
4155000	4157000	Well, I'm just like...
4157000	4160000	There's a person talking to me!
4160000	4163000	And I'm like, how do I?
4163000	4165000	And that's the point, of course, where they're going,
4165000	4167000	My name is Jonathan or whatever.
4167000	4168000	So I'm never going to remember that name anymore.
4168000	4171000	You're turning to Al Pacino?
4171000	4173000	Because she's got a point out!
4173000	4174000	What is it?
4174000	4175000	Do you think it's because...
4175000	4179000	Is it because you don't want to let them down?
4179000	4180000	No, I don't think that's it.
4180000	4181000	I don't think that's it.
4181000	4182000	I think it's because...
4182000	4183000	I'd like to retract that one.
4183000	4184000	I'm not like maudlin about it.
4184000	4187000	But I think my theory is that as a child,
4187000	4189000	when my brain was developing,
4189000	4192000	I think that those were the moments of crisis.
4192000	4194000	I mean, for other people,
4194000	4196000	probably moments of isolation were moments of crisis.
4196000	4199000	I have a lot of memories about being left places
4199000	4204000	and feeling a tremendous amount of relief.
4204000	4206000	I lost the maud.
4206000	4209000	That was so lovely.
4209000	4212000	I was like hiding under a table
4212000	4215000	in a daycare center at a bowling alley once.
4215000	4216000	They didn't know I was there,
4216000	4218000	so they kind of wrapped everything up.
4218000	4219000	I didn't like the other kids.
4219000	4222000	I would just find a cupboard and just climb in it
4222000	4224000	and I would just sit there.
4224000	4226000	I was not doing it to be melodramatic.
4226000	4229000	I was like too much, man, with the people.
4229000	4231000	Girls would put crayons in your mouth.
4231000	4233000	Well, one girl did.
4233000	4236000	This is not a standard experience.
4236000	4240000	That guy, I don't want to be sexist.
4240000	4242000	There was one girl put a crayon in my mouth.
4242000	4244000	That sounds horrible.
4244000	4246000	That's such a violation.
4246000	4248000	She was trying to do a lipstick thing.
4248000	4250000	She probably liked me.
4250000	4255000	But too much, too much, too much.
4255000	4260000	I think that my brain, while developing its circuitry,
4260000	4262000	identifies those moments.
4262000	4265000	There's a lot of toll booths and things
4265000	4268000	and there's just a lot of shit to keep track of.
4269000	4276000	Eye contact, for me, is the mental equivalent
4276000	4278000	of holding a microphone in front of a speaker.
4278000	4280000	When I look somebody in the eye...
4280000	4283000	This would have been such a perfect one for Aaron to come to.
4283000	4285000	God, I wish he knew this.
4285000	4286000	You've seen Wally.
4286000	4290000	Does Wally look like a perfect society to you?
4290000	4292000	Wally, the movie?
4292000	4296000	Yeah, I'd like to be Wally.
4297000	4299000	Do you feel it's because there's something expected of you?
4299000	4301000	I'm trying to narrow in.
4301000	4306000	I think that all humans fear excommunication, alienation.
4306000	4309000	I think that in those moments it's make or break.
4309000	4313000	I think that if you're not good at sports
4313000	4316000	and you're not gifted socially on the playground,
4316000	4321000	I think it's at those moments when people are talking to you
4322000	4327000	when you're at the most danger of getting kicked out of the monkey tree.
4327000	4328000	Right, of being exposed.
4328000	4331000	Who here actually likes going to parties?
4331000	4336000	A certain point that it becomes more worried than like,
4336000	4338000	all right, I'm going to party tonight.
4338000	4341000	I was like, oh, we're going to see them?
4341000	4343000	I think this is a line from Seinfeld once,
4343000	4345000	but I've always felt this way.
4345000	4349000	Not what you said, but what George said was something like,
4349000	4352000	I've never been upset about a meeting being canceled.
4352000	4354000	I really feel that way.
4354000	4357000	There's no meeting that I wouldn't be happier.
4357000	4360000	I get to be put out, oh, I'm halfway to Burbank.
4360000	4363000	Okay, you know what? I totally get it.
4363000	4365000	If they're the one to do it, that's fine.
4365000	4368000	Oh, God, that's great.
4368000	4369000	That is great.
4369000	4372000	I like going to parties, I'm sorry.
4372000	4375000	I do like going.
4375000	4379000	Well, he's like, Kumail was voted like sexiest.
4379000	4380000	What was it?
4380000	4381000	Sexiest.
4381000	4383000	Sexiest Indian.
4383000	4387000	My mother-in-law.
4387000	4390000	Which is worrying on a couple level.
4390000	4393000	I found like my Scottish girlfriend Kate was saying like,
4393000	4397000	when you go to Scotland, like, don't be so gregarious.
4397000	4399000	Don't introduce yourself.
4399000	4401000	I kept embarrassing her like, hello, I'm Jeff.
4401000	4403000	They don't fucking do it, apparently.
4403000	4405000	But nobody was bummed out by it.
4405000	4407000	But she's like, did they do it then?
4407000	4410000	People don't just walk up and go, how do you do?
4410000	4411000	They don't do that.
4411000	4417000	So I kept getting teased for being chatty and gregarious.
4417000	4419000	But the thing is, everybody was cool with it.
4419000	4421000	But I thought you would really like that.
4421000	4425000	It's a culture where people, they tend to be a little more laconic.
4425000	4427000	Well, it's colder, you cover it up, right?
4427000	4430000	There's all these things you do to kind of keep yourself away from people.
4431000	4436000	I've always been very good in a room and good in a crowd.
4436000	4440000	But I think I also, part of that, hello, how do you do stuff,
4440000	4443000	I also forget names because during that five minutes or that five seconds
4443000	4448000	of meeting somebody, I'm not paying attention to somebody's name.
4448000	4449000	I forget names all the fucking time.
4449000	4451000	I did it in the green room just now.
4451000	4453000	I'm terrible at it.
4453000	4455000	Mitch.
4455000	4457000	There's actually a great, he worked on Cheers, right?
4458000	4462000	Just reading a thing about how there's a great way to remember people's names.
4462000	4464000	Like you can remember anybody's name.
4464000	4467000	You have to care.
4467000	4471000	See, that's a bridge too far for me.
4471000	4472000	It's a bridge too far.
4472000	4473000	It's a tough thing.
4473000	4475000	I could draw somebody afterwards.
4475000	4477000	I could remember everything they wore.
4477000	4478000	It could be two years later.
4478000	4481000	I could tell you the conversation verbatim.
4481000	4482000	I don't know your fucking name.
4482000	4484000	Yeah, I think that's pretty common, actually.
4484000	4485000	I don't think that's so interesting.
4485000	4489000	I'm not saying I'm special, but I'm good at chatting with people
4489000	4492000	and being convivial and stuff like that.
4492000	4498000	But I think I also, and that's my way of keeping people at the Heisman Trophy
4498000	4500000	kind of at arm's length.
4500000	4502000	I hold on to West Deer and kind of press people.
4502000	4504000	Could you stop talking about sports, please?
4504000	4505000	Yeah.
4505000	4507000	It's my podcast.
4507000	4511000	I'll go through a party invite and look at the guest list
4511000	4513000	where you can see who's replied yes or no.
4513000	4516000	And I will go through, and all the people that have replied yes,
4516000	4520000	I will picture the conversation I will be having with that person.
4520000	4524000	And if there's ever an awkward one, I'm like, I can't go to this party.
4524000	4525000	What else do you feel like?
4525000	4526000	I just went.
4526000	4527000	Yeah.
4527000	4529000	That was exhausting.
4529000	4530000	It saves gas.
4530000	4531000	It saves money.
4531000	4532000	Also, you're a Netflix queue.
4532000	4533000	You don't have to watch it.
4533000	4534000	Yeah.
4534000	4536000	You've read the descriptions.
4536000	4538000	You never say goodbye at parties.
4538000	4539000	Ever.
4539000	4541000	And so my mission became for a full couple of months
4541000	4543000	to catch you trying to leave.
4543000	4544000	Yeah.
4544000	4545000	And I would like to call you out.
4545000	4549000	It's crazy that we have to say bye or hello in general.
4549000	4552000	Because if you say goodbye to everyone at the party,
4552000	4554000	that's called being at the party twice.
4554000	4557000	That's what you do when you get to the party.
4557000	4558000	You go say hi to everybody.
4558000	4560000	That's what a party is.
4560000	4561000	Then you're not leaving.
4561000	4564000	You'd have to go to each of them and say, well, I'm not leaving right now.
4564000	4567000	It's also so arrogant to be like, it's so arrogant to go up to someone
4567000	4569000	and be like, I am leaving.
4569000	4572000	You might want to consider two.
4572000	4573000	I pick one person.
4573000	4576000	I choose someone as emissary or ambassador like, hey, I'm leaving.
4576000	4578000	If anybody asks, I fucking boned out.
4578000	4579000	Yeah, maybe.
4579000	4581000	If somebody's going to seedy dirt out.
4581000	4584000	Have you ever, as someone left without saying bye and you've gone like,
4584000	4586000	they didn't say bye to me.
4586000	4592000	That's a polite way of saying, I wonder if anybody ever said, where's Jeff?
4592000	4594000	Well, this happened to me last week.
4594000	4596000	Someone left, but they were at my house.
4596000	4598000	And there were only two people there.
4598000	4599000	I don't remember who it is.
4599000	4602000	And we were just like, did Blank just leave?
4602000	4606000	He just left while we were hanging out last week with four people.
4606000	4611000	Chris McKenna on your writing staff, it'll be four people and he'll just evaporate.
4611000	4613000	He'll just fucking atomize.
4613000	4616000	You raise the Irish goodbye to Masterpiece levels.
4616000	4620000	He has a black belt and fucking just disappearing acts.
4620000	4622000	We were mid-conversation.
4622000	4624000	He said he had to go to the bathroom.
4624000	4628000	And I go, you just hear like a car going, what?
4628000	4630000	Like, that's fucked up.
4630000	4633000	Go in the bathroom and just throw it from every movie.
4633000	4635000	There's a window in here.
4635000	4638000	If you're six foot six like he is and you can stand in front of a table and go,
4638000	4640000	good night, everybody.
4640000	4641000	I say do that one.
4641000	4644000	Don't just fucking crawl onto the carpet and just like leave.
4644000	4650000	Our writer's assistant has a shotgun sound effect queued up on his computer.
4650000	4655000	Literally any time Mike Schur goes anywhere else, you hear he plays that sound effect.
4655000	4657000	So we'll just be like, work on that.
4657000	4660000	And then I'll go into his office and we'll just hear it.
4660000	4663000	And it's funny every time.
4664000	4666000	Dan, I think it's time to, we should bring out Spencer, shouldn't we?
4666000	4668000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's get Spencer out here.
4668000	4669000	Let's go.
4680000	4682000	Okay, hey guys.
4684000	4689000	We were wondering, when we were in Scotland, we were wondering if you would be a kilt type,
4689000	4691000	how you would take, because you're such a shorts guy.
4691000	4694000	Oh yeah, I'm all about ventilation.
4694000	4696000	Yeah, we actually had a conversation.
4696000	4699000	Like, did I ask you?
4699000	4703000	I bet Spencer could cut into the whole kilt thing.
4703000	4708000	Yeah, I could see you just putting on a kilt and then having an epiphany and going like,
4708000	4712000	pants are all about limitation of movement.
4712000	4714000	He's wearing jeans tonight.
4714000	4716000	I've never seen that before.
4716000	4718000	It's awkward, I guess.
4718000	4720000	Those are pajama jeans, aren't they?
4720000	4722000	No, not the real.
4722000	4724000	That's what my dad wears.
4724000	4726000	He's big into like designer jeans.
4726000	4728000	He's like, touch them. They're like pajamas.
4728000	4731000	Can I tell you this? This is what happened to my dad.
4731000	4733000	Last week in his house, he fell down.
4733000	4736000	This is not a happy story. It's just a crazy story.
4736000	4738000	Broke his arm. He's 58. He's young.
4738000	4741000	Broke his arm between his shoulder and his elbow. Broke it.
4741000	4742000	But it was a blizzard.
4742000	4744000	So he's been sitting at home for four days.
4744000	4745000	What?
4745000	4748000	With a broken arm and it's like a fucking zombie movie.
4748000	4752000	He's like, you know, I'm just sitting here reading a lot of Tylenol extras
4752000	4755000	and that's what he's been doing for like five days.
4755000	4757000	But he can't get out to go to a doctor?
4757000	4758000	Yeah, he can't get out to go to a doctor.
4758000	4759000	Where does he live?
4759000	4760000	New Jersey.
4760000	4762000	It's like a foot of snow outside.
4762000	4764000	He's just there with a fucked up arm.
4764000	4766000	He's just like, he gets up in the morning.
4766000	4768000	It's like a 127 hour situation.
4768000	4769000	Yeah.
4769000	4772000	But tomorrow he might not have an arm.
4772000	4774000	Or a dad.
4774000	4777000	He's joking. He's fine. He's doing great.
4777000	4780000	Right. There's that one scenario where he just chews off the rest of his body,
4780000	4782000	just leaves the arm.
4784000	4786000	Where's dad?
4786000	4790000	Is most of that movie spent with James Franco in the hole
4790000	4793000	or is most of it like flashbacks to how he ended up in the hole?
4793000	4795000	The rock before he gets there.
4797000	4798000	Dwayne The Rock Johnson?
4798000	4799000	No, no, it's...
4800000	4801000	Not Dwayne The Rock.
4801000	4804000	I thought you were saying it's the whole geological history of that rock.
4804000	4807000	It's this thick of like 500,000 years of...
4807000	4809000	Morgan Freeman comes over to the voiceover.
4809000	4812000	When I was 10, I always wondered how rocks were...
4812000	4815000	The Franco part is just a blip on the radar of that rock's hole.
4815000	4816000	Geologically.
4817000	4818000	The clock.
4818000	4820000	I'm never going to watch that movie.
4820000	4822000	Yeah, why would you?
4823000	4826000	But it's a guy in isolation. Isn't that heaven, Dan?
4826000	4829000	No, and to be clear, I mean, nobody's more lonely than me.
4829000	4831000	Nobody reacts more poorly to isolation than me.
4831000	4834000	But as a kid, I was just like, you know, I was very, very relieved
4834000	4836000	to get some time alone.
4836000	4840000	I just didn't want to walk away from that conversation
4840000	4842000	without having clarified that.
4842000	4848000	But Dan, how does being on stage with a microphone
4848000	4850000	in front of a group of people, how does that compare?
4850000	4852000	Is that heaven or hell or both?
4852000	4856000	Well, it's heaven because I get to talk to people,
4856000	4859000	but I've got personal space around me.
4859000	4863000	No one's like, with the exception of Adam Goldberg, talking back.
4864000	4866000	No, I like that the...
4866000	4869000	In our crowd here, sometimes people come up and...
4869000	4874000	Whatever, it feels more honest to me
4874000	4878000	because I feel like when you meet someone on a street corner,
4878000	4883000	there's this performance element to it that feels dishonest
4883000	4885000	because you're on a street corner.
4885000	4887000	Well, but that's all about being authentic.
4887000	4890000	I mean, that's what you end up trying to struggle with.
4890000	4893000	I do. I always think, am I being full of shit here?
4893000	4898000	Am I trying to be likable? I get very self-conscious about that.
4898000	4902000	And you can get past that almost like you do on stage, really,
4902000	4905000	which is just kind of making it about them.
4905000	4908000	Yeah, but I guess that's where the bad habit comes in
4908000	4910000	because up here, I'm allowed to make it all about me.
4910000	4912000	And what I need to do is try to form...
4912000	4914000	If I'm serious about wanting to change,
4914000	4916000	I try to form new synapses in my brain
4916000	4918000	where I care about the other people,
4918000	4920000	where I'm listening and...
4920000	4923000	When we were traveling, for me,
4923000	4926000	heaven is being in a new city, a new country,
4926000	4930000	and learning new things about different cultures,
4930000	4932000	but you find out everybody's the same.
4932000	4934000	People are people, wherever you go.
4934000	4936000	And that's the most rewarding thing in the world.
4936000	4939000	So heaven, for me, is a stranger at a bar.
4939000	4941000	The most interesting person is always the stranger
4941000	4942000	sitting next to you.
4942000	4943000	For me, that's my heaven,
4943000	4945000	but that's totally opposite of you, probably, Dan.
4945000	4949000	You're way more insular when you travel.
4949000	4950000	Yeah.
4952000	4954000	You also said that you don't like traveling to countries
4954000	4955000	where they don't speak English.
4955000	4957000	That's hard on you, right?
4957000	4958000	Yeah, I mean...
4958000	4960000	You just feel inadequate, right?
4960000	4961000	I feel inadequate.
4961000	4963000	I feel like I'm so sorry I don't speak your language.
4963000	4965000	I feel like I should apologize for it all the time.
4965000	4968000	Yeah, and I can barely understand the Scottish and the Irish.
4968000	4970000	I mean, that's all I can do to try to keep up.
4970000	4973000	I can't understand half of you guys.
4973000	4974000	I'm always...
4974000	4976000	Why did you point at me when you said that?
4978000	4981000	I'm always, in America, I'm constantly going,
4981000	4983000	what, what, what, what?
4983000	4984000	I don't know if I'm hard of hearing,
4984000	4986000	or I think it's more like I'm so fucking overwhelmed
4986000	4989000	when someone's talking to me that I can't...
4989000	4993000	I gotta buffer it and digest it or something.
4993000	4997000	So yeah, fucking Paris was a goddamn beyond a nightmare.
4997000	4999000	I just had to switch off and just be like,
4999000	5001000	soon we'll be out of Paris.
5001000	5004000	I just don't know what to do.
5004000	5007000	I don't want to be the guy that refuses to try to speak French,
5007000	5010000	so I'll try to speak French and order fucking...
5010000	5012000	I guess I ordered the boot.
5012000	5013000	I'll eat the boot.
5013000	5014000	I'm eating the boot.
5014000	5016000	Merci, merci.
5016000	5018000	Why is the boot on the menu?
5018000	5020000	It's just there to test it.
5020000	5022000	No, it's not a restaurant.
5026000	5028000	Are we eating at a shoe store?
5028000	5031000	They have a menu.
5031000	5034000	So they call it Zara here too.
5034000	5036000	Shit.
5036000	5037000	Stupid.
5037000	5038000	Now Spencer.
5038000	5040000	There's a guy in a corner cutting up a boot.
5040000	5042000	What part of the boot do you want?
5042000	5044000	Five.
5044000	5046000	Two nightmares.
5047000	5049000	I mean, I talk about a nightmare shoe shopping
5049000	5051000	when the people get all hands-on about it.
5051000	5054000	I want the roast heel!
5056000	5058000	Steve, do you travel?
5058000	5060000	Do you like to go abroad?
5060000	5062000	Yeah, I haven't traveled in a while.
5062000	5065000	I think the last place I went was Halifax,
5065000	5067000	which was beautiful.
5067000	5068000	My dad right there said he loved it.
5068000	5070000	Were you working there?
5070000	5072000	No, I was just hanging out.
5072000	5073000	You just fucked off?
5073000	5075000	With a friend to a cabin in the middle of nowhere.
5075000	5077000	With no electricity or running water.
5077000	5079000	We got water from a well
5079000	5082000	and swam in a lake and kayaked.
5082000	5083000	It was amazing.
5083000	5086000	I think this conforms with how people think of you.
5086000	5088000	It's so not me.
5088000	5089000	I don't think it's so.
5089000	5090000	Really?
5090000	5091000	Yeah.
5091000	5093000	You were a mountain climber for a long time.
5093000	5094000	I was.
5094000	5096000	And you go to like, don't realize that.
5096000	5098000	Joshua, please hang out there on your own all the time.
5098000	5100000	Yeah, I go do mushrooms out there.
5100000	5102000	On your own, right?
5102000	5103000	Not on my own.
5103000	5106000	I did acid at Joshua Tree, and I was sitting on a rock.
5106000	5108000	Those big, round rocks.
5108000	5113000	And I don't like snakes, like when I'm not on acid.
5113000	5114000	But on acid.
5114000	5116000	Boy, oh boy.
5116000	5119000	I was sitting on a rock, and I did like a tiny,
5119000	5121000	I wasn't really, really, really tripping.
5121000	5122000	But I was on acid.
5122000	5123000	I was high.
5123000	5125000	And I heard just like the bugs are going.
5125000	5127000	I was just sitting there, and I was looking at a rock.
5127000	5128000	It looked like a face.
5128000	5130000	I went there sober the next day.
5130000	5132000	It still looked like a face, by the way.
5132000	5135000	You didn't have to be on acid to see a face on this rock.
5135000	5137000	But I was just sitting there like, hey man, what's going on?
5137000	5140000	And then my friend Mark Rivers comes up with a big,
5140000	5143000	like, heavy duty flashlight.
5143000	5145000	It was giant, like lantern ones.
5145000	5147000	And I was like, hey man, you're bubbling me out
5147000	5148000	with your lights, man.
5148000	5151000	The moon is bright enough, Jack.
5151000	5153000	Listen to the bugs, man.
5153000	5154000	He's like, Jeff, don't move.
5154000	5155000	It's a rattlesnake.
5155000	5157000	The buzzing was a fucking rattlesnake.
5157000	5159000	He was sitting right next to me.
5159000	5161000	He goes, zzzz.
5161000	5163000	And I'd been there for an hour listening to that.
5163000	5167000	And I look up and go, hey buddy.
5167000	5168000	The next day I was not on acid.
5168000	5170000	And I was looking over both shoulders,
5170000	5171000	my jeans tucked into my shoes.
5171000	5172000	Like, I was fucking.
5172000	5176000	I think the snakes in Joshua Tree are probably used to people
5176000	5177000	on acid.
5177000	5178000	Yeah.
5178000	5179000	Yeah, I know.
5179000	5180000	I'm beautiful.
5180000	5183000	There's another one.
5183000	5185000	It's crazy.
5185000	5187000	Yeah, but if you're going to do a listen to Jim's,
5187000	5188000	Joshua Tree is the place.
5188000	5189000	It's the place.
5189000	5191000	I did it at Madison Square Garden last week,
5191000	5192000	and it was great.
5192000	5193000	For what?
5193000	5194000	Acid?
5194000	5195000	Fish, yeah.
5195000	5196000	Wait, you did acid?
5196000	5197000	Acid?
5197000	5198000	At a fish conference.
5198000	5199000	Fish is still a bend?
5199000	5200000	Don't, don't, Harris.
5200000	5202000	This is like his fucking thing, dude.
5202000	5203000	Yeah, he's serious.
5203000	5205000	I did almost get into my first fight at a fish show ever,
5205000	5207000	out of, like, 90 shows.
5207000	5208000	Where, like, there's this guy.
5208000	5210000	What would a fish fight me about?
5210000	5212000	Like a big Cinderella thing or something.
5212000	5213000	I'll tell you what it's about.
5213000	5214000	Just a guy.
5214000	5217000	It's hacky what this fight was about,
5217000	5220000	and there was a guy who was on Ketamine, Special K.
5220000	5223000	When you're on K, your, like, base position is, like,
5223000	5225000	leaning back, and you're bumping into everyone,
5225000	5227000	and I kind of, it's just known that you kind of push,
5227000	5229000	gently push him off you when he goes and bumps
5229000	5230000	into the next person.
5230000	5231000	Yeah, that's known.
5231000	5232000	That's his night.
5232000	5233000	But I just, I gently pushed him,
5233000	5235000	and I feel these two arms wrap around me,
5235000	5236000	these thick arms.
5236000	5238000	He's like, don't fucking push him.
5238000	5240000	That's my son.
5240000	5242000	Whoa.
5242000	5244000	Daddy Ketamine was there?
5244000	5246000	Ketamine guy's dad.
5246000	5248000	Papa K.
5248000	5249000	Papa K.
5249000	5251000	And he wouldn't let go, and he was like,
5251000	5252000	he's just drunk.
5252000	5254000	And I was like, he hasn't been drinking all night.
5254000	5255000	He's on Ketamine.
5255000	5256000	I know what that is.
5256000	5258000	He's done a terrible job.
5262000	5264000	And he said, if I let go, don't fucking push him.
5264000	5266000	And I said, let go of me right now.
5266000	5267000	Let go of me.
5267000	5268000	And he's not letting go.
5268000	5271000	My friend, who weighs probably 300 pounds,
5271000	5272000	is a very large man,
5272000	5274000	finally sees this happening.
5274000	5277000	He's on acid too, and he just bolts both of us over,
5277000	5279000	charges at us, stands in between us.
5279000	5281000	Wait, he takes you down too?
5281000	5283000	Yeah, he was like, he's tripping.
5283000	5286000	I was like, I appreciate just fucking breaking up
5286000	5287000	the whole situation.
5287000	5289000	He aimed for him, but I got a little of it.
5289000	5291000	Baby with the bathwater.
5291000	5294000	And then the guy, my friend standing between us
5294000	5297000	as this guy, and I'm on acid,
5297000	5300000	and it's very scary when this is being yelled at.
5300000	5303000	He's like, you don't know the rage of a father.
5304000	5305000	What's this?
5305000	5307000	I was like, wait, no.
5307000	5309000	Was it Liam Miesen?
5311000	5312000	I got took.
5312000	5313000	I got took.
5313000	5314000	What do you think?
5314000	5315000	Was he on anything?
5315000	5316000	He must have been on something.
5316000	5317000	That's bad.
5317000	5318000	That's very bad.
5318000	5320000	I don't know what he was doing.
5320000	5323000	He likes to start bath salts, and this kid does some K,
5323000	5325000	and then they go to fish together.
5325000	5326000	But for the rest of the night,
5326000	5328000	he was holding his son up from his belt hoop.
5328000	5330000	This kid was like 23 or something.
5330000	5332000	So it was a very weird dynamic.
5333000	5334000	That's fucking weird.
5334000	5336000	Have you really been to 90 fish concerts?
5336000	5338000	Yeah, roughly.
5338000	5340000	Do you follow them around?
5340000	5341000	Do you go on tours with them?
5341000	5344000	Honestly, I know nothing about fish.
5344000	5345000	I have a podcast.
5345000	5346000	You should come on.
5346000	5347000	I'll try to get you to like them.
5347000	5348000	All right.
5348000	5350000	Is it about fish?
5350000	5351000	Yeah, it's called Annalise Fish.
5351000	5354000	I try to get Scott off him once I like them.
5354000	5357000	I want to take the Harris Whittle's fish challenge.
5357000	5358000	Yeah, that would be great.
5358000	5359000	I would love that.
5359000	5361000	It's a good podcast.
5361000	5364000	Most likely, Bob, you having to do drugs and go to a fish show.
5364000	5366000	That is what Scott did.
5366000	5367000	Deal?
5367000	5368000	Yeah, sounds great.
5368000	5370000	I mean, the old joke about Grateful Dead is,
5370000	5373000	what did Grateful Dead fans say when the drugs were off?
5373000	5375000	What the fuck are we listening to?
5375000	5378000	I think Grateful Dead is horrible, I'll say that.
5378000	5379000	Fish, I don't know.
5379000	5382000	All I know about fish is that any girl I ever dated
5382000	5385000	that had a fish bumper sticker was a bummer.
5385000	5387000	She might have been a born-again Christian, you know.
5387000	5389000	That could have been.
5391000	5393000	What a bit of reason.
5393000	5395000	That's a great idea.
5395000	5396000	I had connected those dots.
5396000	5399000	I feel like she wrote that weeks ago and we're hoping.
5399000	5401000	That was amazing.
5401000	5403000	I just steer it over there.
5403000	5405000	I've only met you twice on the show
5405000	5407000	and I've come to hate you for how fucking funny you are.
5407000	5408000	God damn it.
5408000	5410000	Well, have you seen the rest of development?
5410000	5412000	You should have hated him years ago.
5412000	5415000	I just assumed that was a factory of geniuses.
5415000	5419000	It turns out it's just one lunatic who's charming and funny as hell.
5419000	5421000	You have one-liners, you're like,
5421000	5423000	Woody Allen and Annie Hall.
5423000	5425000	I'm not going to make fun of you for this.
5425000	5427000	I'm not going to do it.
5429000	5431000	So how do we play Dungeons and Dragons?
5431000	5433000	Spencer, can you make all six of us play?
5433000	5436000	Can we do some NPCs up here?
5436000	5438000	I can just leave without saying goodbye.
5438000	5440000	You're not fucking kidding me.
5440000	5441000	I don't know.
5441000	5443000	I'll let you guys play.
5444000	5447000	Once you drop acid, we'll just go ahead and play.
5447000	5449000	Shit's going to get real.
5449000	5451000	Spencer, is that possible to throw the whole gang in here?
5451000	5452000	Yeah.
5452000	5454000	I mean, everything's possible with imagination.
5454000	5455000	Fuck yeah.
5459000	5460000	All right.
5460000	5463000	I was in love with Mitch, but you got supplanted by Spencer.
5465000	5466000	What?
5467000	5468000	Supplanted.
5468000	5469000	What does that mean?
5469000	5470000	It means supplementation.
5470000	5472000	It means something you get from supplantation.
5473000	5475000	That's what a winner is so funny.
5475000	5476000	Jesus.
5476000	5477000	Who said it?
5477000	5479000	Well, he jumped out of the supplantation.
5479000	5481000	Supplantation was great.
5481000	5482000	It was amazing.
5482000	5483000	That's what he said.
5483000	5484000	I didn't hear that.
5484000	5486000	I didn't like it the first time.
5487000	5489000	Spencer, break it down for us.
5489000	5490000	Wait.
5490000	5491000	Okay.
5491000	5494000	I hate you.
5494000	5496000	You're so funny.
5496000	5497000	Spencer, break it down for us.
5497000	5498000	Wait.
5498000	5499000	Okay.
5499000	5501000	I hate you.
5501000	5504000	You don't know the rage of a dungeon master.
5506000	5508000	Happy New Year.
5508000	5515000	Last year on Harmon Town, our heroes were near the end of their quest after an all-out,
5515000	5520000	maybe more like a half-assed assault on Admiral Darkstar.
5520000	5524000	They murdered him, unintentionally activating a massive golem.
5525000	5531000	Down but not out, Sharpie became a gas and entered the golem's workings.
5531000	5535000	With the gang attacking the metal monster from both the outside and in,
5535000	5538000	and with some timely help from Avenger the hawk,
5538000	5543000	they eventually managed to decapitate and deactivate the arcane machine.
5543000	5545000	But Christopher took the turn for the worse,
5545000	5550000	vomiting on and grabbing a strange glowing stone from inside the golem,
5550000	5552000	as well as onto doors and such.
5552000	5555000	Together, Chris and Moray knocked the golem all down,
5555000	5559000	and then Christopher began to vomit some more.
5559000	5562000	After realizing their exit was blocked by lava,
5562000	5566000	Sharpie leapt from the window of a several hundred foot tall spire,
5566000	5571000	protected with the feather fall, but leaving his allies high and dry.
5571000	5575000	Luckily, the savvy rogue acted quickly, lassoing Sharpie with his rope
5575000	5578000	and reeling him in so the party could escape together.
5578000	5583000	But as the realization of their valiant deeds began to settle over our heroes,
5583000	5588000	Christopher broke the strange tension by strangely and without provocation,
5588000	5591000	drawing his dagger and deboning his own crotch,
5591000	5596000	sending the dismembered member onto the snowy, cold ground.
5596000	5602000	As blood poured out into the snow, the phallus suffered from high-speed shrinkage.
5602000	5605000	But why? And what now?
5605000	5608000	And Christopher, you lose two charisma points.
5616000	5617000	Wait.
5617000	5618000	I don't want to...
5618000	5623000	Can we not have fucking Duncan Trussell playing anymore?
5624000	5627000	He cut out, so my dick is gone.
5627000	5629000	And I've lost two charisma points.
5629000	5633000	Yeah, until such time as it can be reattached and restored to proper function.
5633000	5637000	It's laying in the snow, but you cut your dick off, you lose two charisma points?
5638000	5641000	It's a house roll. It's been working so far.
5642000	5645000	It comes up a lot more than you might expect.
5646000	5650000	A vibe gets put out, you know, when you don't have a penis.
5650000	5652000	It's a very charismatic dick.
5652000	5656000	Yeah, holy shit. At least I can wear a kilt without fear of...
5656000	5658000	I was thinking...
5658000	5662000	Someone could be Mulrain, and then someone could be Avenger,
5662000	5665000	and then I'd only have like one other person to really worry about.
5667000	5670000	Yeah, so, I mean, is that fine with everybody here?
5671000	5674000	Have Harris be Mulrain, or...
5674000	5676000	Yeah, Mitch, you're Avenger again.
5676000	5678000	And I'll work Steve Agee in that.
5678000	5680000	Okay. That's yours, Harris.
5680000	5682000	Steve will do it. He's played this. I've never played this.
5682000	5685000	It's cool. Everyone's cool, man.
5688000	5690000	This goes down to Jeff.
5690000	5692000	Nobody wants any trouble, Harris.
5692000	5694000	And this goes down to Kumail.
5696000	5697000	Thank you.
5697000	5699000	How many dicks do I have in this?
5700000	5702000	Oh. Okay.
5702000	5705000	Kumail received special notes.
5705000	5708000	Sorry. I was doing a thing.
5708000	5712000	So, yeah. So, you guys, this is a big moment for you.
5712000	5717000	You knocked over the golem, you got out of this tower, you think you killed the guy.
5717000	5722000	You got a glowing stone, his dicks chopped off, his emotions are running high.
5722000	5724000	What's going on?
5725000	5727000	I got heartburn.
5729000	5730000	We did it.
5730000	5731000	We did it.
5731000	5735000	I mean, I guess we accomplished our mission, you guys.
5735000	5739000	I don't know why I have such an empty feeling in me right now.
5739000	5742000	You see Christopher, he's starting to get worse.
5742000	5744000	His eyes, they're growling wide and crazed.
5745000	5747000	Are you going to go around a bit?
5747000	5748000	Huh?
5748000	5749000	Maybe rolling around a bit?
5749000	5751000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just a bit.
5751000	5752000	Perfect.
5752000	5755000	It also says here I can spin my head all the way around.
5755000	5756000	I mean, sure.
5756000	5757000	Watch this.
5757000	5759000	What if I fucking did that?
5761000	5762000	That would be a great card.
5762000	5763000	It's a podcast.
5763000	5766000	Does anybody have any healing abilities or anything?
5766000	5767000	I don't.
5767000	5768000	I feel super weird, guys.
5768000	5771000	I have wild empathy, I can feel that for you.
5771000	5772000	Yeah.
5773000	5775000	Do you see how horrible and weird I feel?
5775000	5776000	Yeah.
5776000	5778000	I'm sorry about that.
5780000	5782000	Should I be his chopped off dick?
5788000	5790000	It's the role you were born to play.
5791000	5793000	I mean, sure.
5793000	5794000	Can I suck on that?
5794000	5795000	It's a joke, right?
5796000	5801000	I vomit acid on, well, not my own chopped off dick.
5803000	5805000	But I vomit acid on Mulrite.
5805000	5808000	But there was a little clue just now when he said that's a joke, right?
5808000	5809000	Was it?
5809000	5812000	I mean, if Steve Agee wants to be his dick, I mean, that's his prerogative.
5812000	5814000	I've always wanted that.
5815000	5817000	It's just not much of a speaking role.
5817000	5819000	But you do have two points of charisma.
5819000	5820000	It is, yeah.
5820000	5822000	So I've got two charisma.
5823000	5825000	Steve, it's kind of a small part.
5825000	5826000	All right.
5826000	5828000	We'll find another.
5829000	5831000	Well, we'll find something else.
5833000	5837000	Low hanging fruit.
5837000	5840000	Oh, was that a play on words?
5840000	5841000	If you like.
5842000	5844000	Should we cauterize or...
5844000	5845000	No.
5845000	5848000	He just vomited acid on Mulrite.
5848000	5850000	I just vomited acid on Mulrite and said, fuck you.
5850000	5851000	It burns.
5851000	5852000	It burns the flesh.
5852000	5855000	Is this in accordance with special instructions you've been given?
5855000	5857000	Because you're acting weird.
5857000	5858000	That's pretty metagaming.
5858000	5859000	All right.
5859000	5860000	Okay.
5860000	5862000	Guys, I'm sorry I did that.
5862000	5864000	I didn't mean to.
5864000	5866000	I feel weird.
5866000	5870000	And almost as if I don't feel like myself.
5871000	5875000	And upon those words, you hear the clank of plate mail,
5875000	5879000	and you spy the golden armor of a warrior figure,
5879000	5882000	perhaps some sort of cleric of Pelor.
5882000	5886000	Upon closer inspection, it's your old compatriot,
5886000	5888000	Morris Goldbright.
5891000	5893000	Morris!
5893000	5896000	Hey, how's it going?
5896000	5897000	Wait.
5897000	5900000	I've been hiding.
5900000	5903000	I shoot laser beam eyes there.
5903000	5905000	You shoot laser beam eyes.
5905000	5910000	Everybody looks as laser beams fire from your eyes.
5910000	5911000	The hell?
5911000	5913000	We strike Morris Goldbright,
5913000	5916000	but he doesn't seem affected for whatever reason.
5916000	5917000	Sorry about that.
5917000	5920000	I draw my sword and hold it up to Krista Berg and say,
5920000	5923000	what's the deal, Jack?
5923000	5924000	Hey.
5924000	5926000	Hey, I'm cool.
5926000	5927000	I don't know what's going on.
5927000	5929000	That's not, you vomited acid.
5929000	5930000	Dude, I can't control it.
5930000	5931000	I can't control it.
5931000	5932000	Well then, keep it together.
5932000	5933000	I mean, look.
5933000	5934000	Look, look at me.
5934000	5936000	No, you have laser beam eyes.
5936000	5937000	No.
5937000	5938000	Trust me.
5938000	5939000	I don't look at him.
5939000	5942000	I shoot the side of his face.
5942000	5943000	See?
5943000	5944000	It burns.
5944000	5945000	It burns the flesh.
5945000	5946000	Well, no it doesn't.
5946000	5947000	I'm sorry.
5947000	5948000	You missed.
5948000	5949000	Yeah.
5949000	5950000	See?
5950000	5951000	I'm going to hit you.
5951000	5952000	Well, you know, you tried to.
5952000	5953000	Nope.
5953000	5954000	You're just shitty at it.
5954000	5955000	I crossed my eyes so it went around you.
5955000	5959000	Look, I'm not going to wait for you to get good at burning me with your eyes.
5959000	5960000	No.
5960000	5961000	I'm like, I'm giant.
5961000	5962000	I'm fighting it.
5962000	5966000	Can I use my, when I get a turn, I want to use my arm lid of spring,
5966000	5971000	which can shoot thorny vines 20 feet to protect your ensnare enemies.
5971000	5977000	I'm going to obviously opting to ensnare this frenemy.
5977000	5982000	You ensnare the frenemy and you see a small thing fall out of his hand
5982000	5986000	as he gets grasped by the vines, the grasping vines.
5986000	5993000	I toss a, I toss a crayon into his mouth.
5993000	5997000	It hits.
5997000	6000000	So now he's tied up, dropped a thing.
6000000	6001000	What is that thing?
6001000	6002000	Avenger.
6002000	6003000	Avenger, go get that thing.
6003000	6005000	Well, he said it's a little thing.
6005000	6008000	He didn't say that.
6008000	6011000	So, Avenger, get that.
6011000	6012000	Oh, Avenger, that's me.
6012000	6013000	Oh, it doesn't want to.
6013000	6014000	Oh, I get it.
6014000	6016000	Well, I'm not going to, I'm not going to put it in my beak.
6016000	6017000	That's for sure.
6017000	6018000	I don't think it's a dick.
6018000	6019000	It's a dick.
6019000	6020000	No, he dropped something from his hand.
6020000	6022000	Something from his hand.
6022000	6023000	Yeah.
6023000	6024000	Avenger.
6024000	6025000	This is a game.
6025000	6026000	This is this.
6026000	6027000	We were playing a game.
6027000	6028000	Sorry.
6028000	6029000	That's metagaming.
6029000	6031000	I'm still a beak behind, I don't understand it.
6031000	6033000	So I'm going to pick it up.
6033000	6035000	No, I'm going to pick it up.
6035000	6039000	And I'm going to bring it back to you.
6039000	6040000	Yeah.
6040000	6041000	Yeah.
6041000	6042000	Yeah.
6042000	6043000	Wow.
6043000	6047000	The bar is no.
6047000	6050000	You see it's in the Avengers clutches.
6050000	6055000	It's a small, it's that purple glowing stone that you saw in the golem.
6055000	6061000	As you, as you, as you look at it, it seems to pull slightly and then it shatters and upon shattering.
6061000	6065000	Oh, I start reading a thing.
6065000	6066000	Purple energy.
6066000	6068000	Were you going to propose to somebody?
6068000	6069000	Why?
6069000	6071000	Don't, don't touch my thigh.
6071000	6072000	Okay.
6072000	6077000	As it shatters, purple energy swirls around you before exploding outwards and an intense burst.
6077000	6081000	You're shaken and feel sick as if your very soul was attacked.
6081000	6087000	You feel exhausted instantly as if you haven't slept for days and then a rumbling overtakes all other sounds.
6087000	6097000	As you see the black keep crumbling into itself, collapsing and imploding before falling and disappearing entirely into a pit below the surface of the ice.
6097000	6099000	Really sorry.
6099000	6100000	Really sorry, guys.
6100000	6102000	They clap for it.
6102000	6103000	That sounds good.
6103000	6105000	The black keep has destroyed itself.
6105000	6106000	It seems that way.
6106000	6108000	Do I feel more like myself?
6108000	6112000	You feel kind of stronger.
6112000	6117000	Oh, I tossed the vines aside.
6117000	6118000	That happens.
6118000	6120000	You burst forth from the vines.
6120000	6122000	Did you guys see what I just did?
6122000	6124000	Sounds fucking badass.
6124000	6127000	You're on fucking friend probation right now, man.
6127000	6128000	Okay.
6128000	6129000	I got it.
6129000	6130000	I'm sorry.
6130000	6131000	I don't, I don't mean to.
6131000	6132000	All right.
6132000	6133000	Really?
6133000	6134000	Look.
6134000	6135000	Okay.
6135000	6138000	The stone fell out of Kristin Berg's hand.
6138000	6139000	A venture got it.
6139000	6140000	It broke.
6140000	6144000	The black keep dissolved and crumbled and went away.
6144000	6145000	Yeah.
6145000	6148000	I'm sorry to keep track of, I know.
6148000	6153000	I look at everybody and say, well, gentlemen and ladies, we did it.
6153000	6156000	I guess this is the end of the adventure.
6156000	6160000	Seems like we, you know, I.
6160000	6163000	Maybe there's some moment where we say, hey, that all worked out.
6163000	6165000	Except Chris lost his dick.
6165000	6166000	And then we all laugh.
6166000	6167000	And freeze.
6167000	6168000	And that's the end.
6168000	6169000	All right.
6169000	6172000	I, I, I just did a moment of whimsy.
6172000	6174000	Go and pick up the severed penis.
6174000	6175000	Go in.
6175000	6180000	Just, just because I am going to, I, I grabbed Mulrain's craft kit and I just
6180000	6181000	tried, I tried to crudely.
6181000	6185000	So, uh, that got Kristin Berg's dick back on.
6185000	6187000	Are you going to stand for that?
6187000	6189000	Me or?
6189000	6191000	It would hurt.
6191000	6194000	You can use my, my threads.
6194000	6195000	Oh.
6195000	6197000	Well, I, it hurts.
6197000	6198000	Yeah, it would, right?
6198000	6199000	Oh.
6199000	6203000	While he's going there, I gently whisper while you're down there.
6203000	6206000	And I go, what?
6206000	6209000	And then I shoot the back of his head with my laser.
6209000	6211000	You don't have laser power anymore.
6211000	6213000	He definitely does.
6213000	6214000	He does.
6214000	6216000	And I shoot the back of his head.
6216000	6217000	That one hits.
6217000	6218000	What the fuck?
6218000	6219000	He's still evil.
6219000	6221000	I'm trying to sew your dick on.
6221000	6222000	I'm so sorry.
6222000	6226000	You take nine damage as the laser beams into your head.
6226000	6227000	Dammit.
6227000	6228000	What the fuck?
6228000	6230000	You feel all messed up.
6230000	6235000	You know, and the old saying goes, don't, uh, don't, uh, try to reattach the dick
6235000	6238000	to a guy who is possessed.
6241000	6244000	They do say that around here.
6244000	6253000	I, uh, I stop, I take his dick back and I throw it into the, uh, I throw it into
6253000	6256000	the abyss where the dark keep crumbled into.
6256000	6257000	No.
6257000	6265000	I say, uh, you, you, you, you ditched around with the wrong guy.
6267000	6268000	All right, that happens.
6268000	6270000	Does he really throw it into the abyss?
6270000	6271000	Do you want to try and stop him or something?
6271000	6273000	Yeah, I try and stop him.
6273000	6275000	What are your guys' dexterity?
6275000	6277000	Oh, fucking hi, baby.
6277000	6278000	Fourteen.
6278000	6280000	Fourteen is plus two.
6280000	6281000	Plus two.
6281000	6283000	Mine is, uh, eighteen plus two, bitch.
6283000	6285000	Eighteen plus four.
6285000	6286000	Okay.
6286000	6288000	Uh, yeah, he throws it in the pit.
6291000	6297000	Try as you might, you try to grab it out of his hand or maybe slap it out of his hand.
6297000	6301000	But he throws it into the heart of the pit itself.
6302000	6304000	Fuck, don't control stuff.
6307000	6313000	So, so can I, uh, I just throw up on myself a little bit.
6313000	6314000	Wait a second.
6314000	6316000	Somebody in the crowd yelled, you can regenerate it?
6316000	6317000	Is that true?
6317000	6318000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6318000	6319000	Who?
6319000	6321000	Morris as a cleric could regenerate that dick.
6321000	6325000	Hey, hey, I don't know why you're all freaking out.
6325000	6327000	I can fix that.
6327000	6328000	I'll tell you why I'm freaking out.
6328000	6330000	He shot lasers in the back of my head when I was trying to put his dick back on.
6330000	6332000	We gotta restrain those guys.
6332000	6333000	Yeah.
6333000	6337000	Okay, I look at Sharpie and I go, Sharpie, you're right.
6337000	6339000	Put the vines around me again.
6339000	6342000	I'm a danger to myself and everyone around me.
6344000	6346000	You already got out of those.
6346000	6349000	I have a thing called, a feat called still spell.
6349000	6351000	Yeah, so I should, yeah, still spell.
6351000	6353000	That means you don't have to move to cast a spell.
6353000	6354000	Yeah.
6354000	6355000	It's, yeah.
6355000	6359000	I was, yeah, I should mention I switched your guys' character sheets over to Pathfinder.
6359000	6360000	Thank you.
6360000	6363000	So everyone's is all revamped.
6363000	6367000	I didn't try so hard with Jeff's because I thought you'd want to customize it yourself.
6367000	6368000	All right.
6368000	6369000	I haven't had a chance, but I love that.
6369000	6372000	I gave some, I gave some options, but it's all up for grabs.
6372000	6375000	Everyone's playing Pathfinder, so I'm not a dungeon master anymore.
6375000	6376000	I'm a game master.
6376000	6379000	Whoa.
6379000	6381000	Nothing changes.
6383000	6384000	Yeah.
6384000	6386000	Maybe I should use reduce person on him.
6386000	6389000	I mean, at least that'll reduce his person.
6389000	6390000	I get it.
6390000	6393000	Hey, my person has already been reduced.
6395000	6398000	I think I'll make your severed dick with look now though.
6400000	6401000	All right.
6401000	6402000	Well, you know what?
6402000	6406000	Maybe I'll try, unless it's too late, I'll try charm person.
6406000	6407000	On him?
6407000	6408000	Yeah.
6408000	6410000	See if that overpowers the possession.
6410000	6414000	He, he seems pretty friendly.
6414000	6415000	It's working.
6415000	6416000	Hey, what's up?
6418000	6421000	You, you, you have something to say to me?
6421000	6422000	See?
6422000	6427000	I go up and I, I, I, I, I grapple him like an angry dad at a fish concert and hold on.
6428000	6430000	And I say, what's it going to be, man?
6430000	6433000	With the rage of a father, you clutch him tight.
6439000	6441000	What is it going to be, Jack?
6442000	6445000	So he's got me, I think so.
6445000	6446000	I'm grappling you.
6446000	6447000	I'm holding you.
6447000	6448000	You know what?
6448000	6452000	I use my fucking super strength and just toss him into the abyss.
6454000	6456000	What in the duck and trust me.
6456000	6459000	And I say, there's something down there for you.
6463000	6468000	Using your super unnatural strength, you hug the gnome into the pit.
6469000	6472000	I am so sorry.
6473000	6475000	Quark!
6476000	6477000	Somebody grab me.
6477000	6480000	I, I, I reach out and grab his foot.
6481000	6483000	Or you would.
6483000	6487000	I would if you didn't.
6488000	6490000	I mean, that's not accurate.
6490000	6492000	That's not, doesn't make any sense.
6492000	6493000	It doesn't happen.
6493000	6495000	Oh, he, he didn't, it didn't work?
6495000	6496000	No.
6496000	6498000	Wait, no, but he's going in the abyss, right?
6498000	6500000	Oh, yeah, yeah, he's going sailing into this pit.
6500000	6501000	Oh, shit.
6502000	6505000	Oh, I'll suck your dick in hell.
6508000	6510000	That's a cliffhanger, right?
6510000	6512000	No, I'm going to save Jeff first.
6512000	6514000	Okay.
6514000	6516000	How are you going to manage that?
6516000	6518000	By...menon.
6518000	6520000	By, uh...
6521000	6523000	You're going to make the utterance?
6524000	6527000	I'm going to, I'm going to now dig this, buddy.
6529000	6530000	Oh, shit.
6530000	6533000	Where's that rod that I had that had the button on top of it?
6533000	6535000	I'll tell you where my rod is.
6537000	6538000	Bunstaff.
6538000	6540000	Bunstaff got melted in the lava.
6540000	6541000	Oh, for Christ.
6541000	6547000	Because, because if you recall, you had to save Quark after he was raping the Robo Spider.
6547000	6555000	I know that your subtle implication is that everything that's happening to us, we deserve.
6556000	6559000	But it's not easy to play Dungeons and Dragons.
6559000	6563000	It's like, it's like, you know, you make weird decisions.
6563000	6565000	Like ripping a Robo Spider.
6565000	6569000	Um, I was thinking I would use my teleport cape.
6569000	6571000	What's the situation?
6571000	6575000	He's, the abyss is like, is it like a portal or is it like a pit?
6575000	6579000	A hole in the ground, like the ice like broke and fell through.
6579000	6581000	And he's tumbling down it?
6581000	6582000	Yeah.
6582000	6583000	I guess I got it.
6583000	6585000	Well, how many Feather Falls can I cast?
6585000	6587000	You're pretty much out of Feather Falls.
6587000	6594000	You used the last, no, I mean, you got one left, but you used everything, almost of your level one spells already.
6594000	6597000	But I got a full charge of my teleport cape.
6597000	6598000	Yeah, yeah.
6598000	6604000	So I teleport into the mid-air, aside my friend, and grab ahold of him in Feather Fall.
6604000	6605000	That happens.
6605000	6608000	You grab him and fluke Feather stuff.
6608000	6612000	Dan, it's 10 o'clock.
6612000	6613000	Give us a good line.
6613000	6618000	And maybe Avenger might do some Robin Williams a button on this.
6618000	6620000	Maybe you should turn to Avenger.
6620000	6623000	I think we need a good dick joke to get us out.
6623000	6624000	Yeah, maybe, maybe.
6624000	6625000	I mean, be ready, Avenger.
6625000	6627000	Dan?
6627000	6631000	Uh, going down?
6632000	6634000	Yeah.
6634000	6636000	Yeah, going down on Chris.
6636000	6637000	I didn't sell it.
6637000	6638000	I didn't want to.
6638000	6639000	I didn't want to.
6639000	6640000	I don't know.
6640000	6642000	So he's got ahold of me in mid-air?
6642000	6643000	Yeah, yeah.
6643000	6644000	You guys are clutching.
6644000	6645000	Thank you.
6645000	6646000	Are we now falling together?
6646000	6647000	Slowly, though.
6647000	6648000	Feather style.
6648000	6654000	Can you read my mind?
6654000	6656000	Do your little Lois Lane voiceover.
6656000	6659000	Ask a lot of rhetorical questions about it.
6659000	6660000	You've got me.
6660000	6663000	Who's got you?
6663000	6665000	Cliffhanger!
6671000	6672000	Thank you, everybody.
6672000	6676000	Happy 2014.
6676000	6679000	Thank you, Spencer Crittenden, Camille Nantiani, Steve Agee,
6679000	6682000	Harris Whittles, Mitch Hurwitz.
6682000	6684000	I'm Jeff Davis.
6684000	6688000	One more time for the mayor of Harvard, Dan Harmon.
6690000	6692000	Sorry, I'm sick.
6692000	6694000	I'll be better next week.
6694000	6697000	But, yeah, those guys are great.
6697000	6702000	I'm not going to be able to do the pictures of the signing stuff
6702000	6705000	because I just feel like shit.
6707000	6708000	Goodnight, all.
