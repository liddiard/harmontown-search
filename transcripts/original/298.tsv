0	12720	God damn right, how are you tonight?
12720	20280	Hormontown is now in session, let them hear you at home.
20280	22080	Make them jealous though.
22080	23080	Yeah!
23080	28320	We're so glad you're here, welcome to the Dynasty typewriter, thank you so much for
28320	33600	coming all the way downtown, let me bring to the stage someone you know and love, Spencer
33600	34600	Crittenden!
34600	43520	He's no joke, Game Master extraordinaire.
43520	48520	Coming back from his sold out all over the city tour, from place to place, but mostly
48520	53520	his couch, the mayor of Hormontown, Dan Harmon!
53520	61120	Hi, I'm your comptroller, my name is Brandon Johnson, have a good night.
61120	71480	Yeah, yeah, hip, yo, hip, hop, yo, yo, hip, hop, got the rhythm, got the soul, got your
71480	80320	mama's pussy in a bowl, I poured it like cereal, and now I'm going out to rock and roll!
80320	86360	I fucked your daddy too, gender equality, whatcha gonna do, here's some gender fluidity,
86360	90680	I fucked your sister, even though next week she's gonna be a mister.
90680	92840	The family tree!
92840	98440	That was my pitch for gender equality, but it turned into like a classic kind of tranny
98440	100760	joke from the 90s.
100760	105440	You played yourself!
105440	109600	I think everybody should be able to say whatever the fuck, whoever they are, I don't care, I
110400	112240	don't care anymore.
112240	120800	I'm listening to this book on tape, Sapiens, let me, thank you, I'm assuming that was for
120800	122960	the author and he can't be here.
122960	123960	Or just homo sapiens?
123960	125480	Right, that's what I thought.
125480	130200	Well that's the interesting thing, I was kind of afraid to go get back into anthropology
130200	135920	because I think the last book I read on anthropology was like a 1967 book, The Naked Ape by Desmond
135920	139880	Morris and I think like, I've always been kind of an armchair anthropology fan, but
139880	144440	it's different from being passionate about anthropology because those people read stuff
144440	151000	and learn stuff, but the thing is anthropology is like a real loaded gun, like it's just
151000	157080	filled with like, the can just says flavor, it doesn't say what flavor.
157080	162160	It may not comfort you, like an anthropologist may say things like this guy at one point
162160	167280	is riffing and just says like, well actually brain size has decreased since the days of
167280	173160	foraging because humanity's ability to create culture made room for an imbecile class.
173160	179400	And you're just like, whoa, what the, what?
179400	184280	It's like, whoa, loaded gun, baby.
184280	190160	But yeah, you made some things like before we were agrarian and when every single person,
190160	194160	like basically when you couldn't, everyone was just running around like, oh, there's
194160	200920	a mushroom, I guess I'll live for another hour, there's a frog, there's a piece of bacon,
200920	206960	I don't know how bacon works, it must come from some plant or something, right?
206960	214040	Foraging gives you all this nutritional variety and it also demands this incredible versatility
214040	215040	in your brain.
215040	220480	And so he was talking about how this idea of like, look, if you're like, the whole,
220480	224600	the whole books, I haven't even scratched the surface yet, but the book seems to start
224600	229920	to tell the story of how, all right, what is it that made human beings like ravage the
229920	230920	earth?
230920	237720	Like, why are we the, the human species of which there are at least like six or so that
237720	242560	have walked the earth, many of whom at the same time, like Homo erectus, Neanderthals,
242560	243560	all that stuff.
243560	244560	I've never seen that before.
244560	245560	Yes.
245560	248640	Like, like, like we're, we're, we're, we're not only, we're cousins with gorillas and
248640	253600	chimps and orangutans, but we're, we have siblings that are gone and their blood is
253600	258240	on our hands, like, like, and that's actually weird.
258240	262520	There's a million kinds of fox, there's a million kinds of bear, there's only one kind
262520	267960	of human and it's not because they all don't work, like there's room for a lot of kind
267960	268960	of bear.
268960	274400	And it's like, oh, like one species of human Homo sapien, as opposed to Homo erectus, which
274400	278320	I always thought was like, I always thought there was like that, you know, Neanderthals
278320	282280	died out because they were dumb, but they're not, I mean, they were dumb in certain ways.
282280	287080	I think that we used to think that they didn't simultaneously exist on the earth and that
287080	290960	chain, that understanding has changed such that we think that probably three or four
290960	293200	were kind of hanging out at the same time, right?
293200	303040	But there was at least a half a dozen Homo, like human species, which is new, Homo erectus
303040	305480	is a completely different species from us.
305480	307600	I like Homo habilis.
307600	312200	They, first of all, use the example of like horses and donkeys.
312200	316200	So horses and donkeys are separate species, but they can mate.
316200	321520	So you know, they talk about, well, we may have mated with Neanderthals, like that idea
321520	327240	of you have one percent Neanderthal in your genes and stuff, but horses don't really,
327240	330320	donkeys and horses, they're not, it's not the first thing that would come into their
330320	332560	head if you put them in a pen together.
332560	339640	You have to get aggressive about suggesting that they do it or the horse has to be, you
339640	345000	know, have issues that demand, that it's more about anger than I don't know what, and ultimately
345000	348640	they produce an offspring that's not even fertile and then you take like, but that's
348640	352720	different from like, like there's a million kinds of dog, but they're all the same species
352720	356400	because they happily, like you put them in a room together, you go away, you have a popsicle,
356400	365240	you come back, you got fucking weird ass boxer, fucking shaped like a slinky.
365240	373680	We walked this earth like, with all these different like specialized brands of human.
373680	378640	animal erectus was like really good at making tools, so good at making tools that it's all
378640	380280	they fucking did.
380280	385120	It was in their genes to make tools, the way when you throw a ball, your golden retriever
385120	391160	like knows how to do something better than like maybe your mutt or your, or like a Jack
391160	396080	Russell who's like, well, that's not a mouse, so I'm going to stare at the electrical outlet
396080	401360	and lick your face until you have no more friends coming over.
401360	405560	Jack Russells are the worst, but you have to like respect them because you're like,
405560	406560	you were mentally ill.
406560	411640	Like if you know anything about mental illness and you meet a Jack Russell, you're just like,
411640	412640	I can't judge you.
412640	413640	You're clearly sick.
413640	418680	You have a sickness that's been bred into you by some person who wanted less rats.
418680	419680	That's not cool.
419680	424040	The dog just stare at the corner of a coffee table because they think it might turn into
424040	426080	a mouse one day.
427080	433920	They're insane anyways, but, but, uh, sorry, but, uh, but, but Homo erectus, like we, is
433920	438320	it like, okay, they made like these flint tools or they have these tools, but they actually
438320	440360	look kind of like it was bred into them.
440360	446560	They walked to the earth for 2 million years making these dumb ass tools.
446560	453920	They never turned that into making tool tools or tool, tool, tool tools, which we are good
453920	454920	at.
454920	459840	And then in the APNs, the book implies now I'm, I'm, I'm extrapolating a lot for listening
459840	461880	for an hour and a half car ride to this book.
461880	464520	That's like, it's a 15 hour book.
464520	470320	Uh, and, and I heard someone wrote it down somewhere and you could with the eyeballs.
470320	471320	Yeah.
471320	475680	But, but the implication is that it's like, we're no better or no worse.
475680	481840	Like it's like, like brain size, whatever, like, like if, if truly of brain size and
481840	488520	like, like if it was just raw intelligence that like made you dominate the earth, of
488520	494360	course, by now there would have been ants with giant heads or he doesn't say that because
494360	498880	he's a scientist and you debunk that I'm making that up, but there'd be like dogs or something
498880	501680	that would be like, like, it would just be like the thing that you always go to.
501680	506400	We kind of have that mythology in our heads, literally that, that, that, that, that it's
506400	507720	like, oh, it's all about that brain.
507720	509160	You got to get to that brain.
509160	512320	But the brain is like really hit or miss as an evolutionary trait.
512320	515040	It was like just betting double zero on a roulette.
515040	522000	Even that's a miss, a misconstruer as I coined it.
522000	526800	He said a misconstruer the other day, really made me misconstru some stuff.
526800	527800	Just talk.
527800	529800	All right.
529800	536360	Um, sapiens like are different.
536360	538240	The thing that separated us out.
538240	539240	Okay.
539240	540240	So get this.
540240	544320	This is, this is the uplifting thing slash biggest bummer in the fucking world.
544320	550360	This guy implies that the reason why we ended up wiping everybody out, whether that meant
550360	558760	fucking them and absorbing them eat and or eating them, um, out hunting them, uh, just,
558760	563920	just, just making them feel unwelcome until they, they deleted their Neanderthal accounts
563920	568280	and like went away because they're like, I don't like where this is going.
568280	573040	Um, if this is what it takes to survive, I'm going to go have a giant brain and live in
573040	575980	the pine trees and fucking go to sleep.
575980	578040	That's what happened to Homo habilis.
578040	580560	Wait, which one is habilis?
580560	589720	Is that they were excellent listeners.
589720	590720	It was great.
590720	591720	It was great.
591720	592720	It didn't win the war.
592720	601160	It was a good skill to have at the time, but didn't win a lot of contests.
601160	603760	They won a few important contests, right?
603760	611120	But they lost the tell me, tell me more passive aggressive wars of 30 million BC when the
611120	613520	Crow Magnets eventually said, go on.
613520	615640	And they were like, I'm out.
615640	622560	But, uh, the, what the, the, the idea put forth in this book is that what we are good
622560	631200	at all of us is, uh, it's the cynical would call it lying, uh, which is not, it's not
631200	632200	unique to us.
632200	645520	So it primates lie, um, the, the, the, the writers among us, if that we're interested
645520	649840	in justifying our jobs or, or getting through tomorrow with a spring in our step, we'd
649840	651760	say we'd call it mythology.
651760	652760	That's what we're good at.
652760	659280	I, I, a corporate lawyer would call it, uh, the ability to handle a contract like essentially
659280	660760	it's all the same thing.
660760	666480	Basically what sapiens are good at, uh, that, that, that gets us past the topping out point
666480	671360	of primate sophistication, which tops out as, as all of us who have ever watched a sitcom
671360	676100	or hung out in a room this size, no, it tops out at a hundred primates.
676100	680120	Like your ability to function as a group, nobody in here, there's no cops in here, but
680120	686160	if somebody jumped up and was like, hail Satan, like we'd, we'd get confused and we'd, we'd
686160	689000	eventually figure out what to do, but we're probably, it probably won't happen because
689000	690000	there's a hundred of us.
690000	693600	If there are a thousand of us, there's going to be 10 people going, hail Satan.
693600	696800	And they're going to get lost in the, they're going to actually be encouraged by the fact
696800	701000	that there's a thousand people to like, and, and also we're all going to start going, that's
701120	702120	someone else's problem.
702120	703120	Chaos.
703120	704120	Chaos.
704120	708480	Um, uh, so what we, like that's where a Neanderthal can't handle it.
708480	715480	Like 500 Neanderthals, they can't do anything 500 homo erectus sapiens perfected the art
715480	719640	of like, we have the lobes in our brain necessary to believe in shit.
719640	720640	That ain't real.
720640	728120	Um, we, we, we're able to, we're able to watch Seinfeld and hear a hundred people and pretend
728120	733000	that those a hundred people represent a million people and just go, Oh, Seinfeld's great.
733000	737560	Even though Seinfeld didn't come over to my house and tell me, uh, he, he's going to help
737560	741000	me out tomorrow, but I'm, I'm on, I'm in Seinfeld's corner.
741000	746080	Like Seinfeld's a flag, Seinfeld's a religion, Seinfeld's a meme, Seinfeld's a, it's symbolism.
746080	752200	It's this idea we can create like a connectivity between strangers that will never meet each
752200	753200	other.
753200	759000	Two Serbians, um, that will never meet can, can both have been taught from childhood
759000	764840	about the importance of, of, of being a Serb and identify that with flag and, and, and,
764840	768680	and they'll see the right flag on each other's arm patch and w or whatever in the middle
768680	772640	of a situation and somebody, somebody might take a bullet for somebody else.
772640	774240	Chimpanzees can't do that.
774240	779600	You can't like, like no, no other even human species, all of which are now extinct can
779600	780600	do that.
780600	785440	So we basically, it's kind of, it's a bummer, a little bit of a bummer.
785440	787160	This is what, this is what we're good at.
787160	788280	This is why we're here.
788280	791120	We're good at this giant mess that we've created.
791120	792120	That's what we're good at.
792120	795680	Are you saying we're the first monkeys with imagination?
795680	797360	That's too fucking beautiful.
797360	802440	That's too poetic, but yeah, but yeah, I guess that, I mean, we're the first, we're the first
802440	809240	human species, the first homo, in, in, in the homo genus, we're the, we're the ones
809240	817680	that, that, that, uh, got really good at sharing ideas that never have to be true, that, that,
817680	823960	that can be so things that never have to be concretized, but can be the most important
823960	824960	thing in the world.
824960	825960	Yeah.
825960	835440	The ability to wake up in bed and say, because I am blank, um, a member of, of a, of a, of
835440	843400	a, of an invisible tribe, a corporation, a country, uh, a, a, a fandom, uh, a political
843400	849840	leaning, uh, a gender, a race, uh, a, a, a type of person, uh, because I am a quality
849840	856700	of life person, uh, like, like, because I am that, that I'm going to do this today,
856700	860640	and it will actually supersede things that for other primates and even other human species
860640	866120	that are now extinct, like they would be like, I'm not going to harvest corn based on, what
866120	867120	did you say?
867120	868360	Mickey Mouse exists?
868360	869600	I don't do it.
869600	870600	I get it.
870600	871600	And then they starve.
871600	873920	And then the people that believe in Mickey Mouse come over the hills and there's, how
873920	877240	are they having 800,000 people with spears?
877240	878240	I give up.
878240	879240	I give up.
879240	880240	Take me to jail.
880240	886680	Um, we, or teach me to learn about corn or, or if you can reproduce with me and I, I mean,
886680	887680	they're done.
887680	888680	Like they're done.
888680	893560	Like, like the, the ones that are like their children are being raised in this environment
893560	895880	of like, of like, no, it's called culture.
895880	896880	It's called mythology.
896880	897880	It's called religion.
897880	898880	It's called lies.
898880	901560	It's called, depending on what mood you're in, it's called all kinds of things.
901560	907080	But it's basically like the fact that we can sustain a life based on nothing based on no,
907080	909920	like, like, and we sometimes get frustrated by that and go like, God damn it.
909920	912960	You know, you're getting that fight club red pill mood and you go, Jesus Christ.
912960	916320	Well, this is the fact fact is I got a big set of balls full of cum.
916320	920440	And if I wanted to, I could fuck this fucking whole dollar store into fucking, I could make
920440	921440	it all pregnant.
921440	923480	Who hasn't said that?
923480	929480	I mean, you could, and you couldn't, you could, if you could somehow figure out a way to hack
929480	936880	symbology and mythology to reduce all of civilization to a basically non sapien mindset.
936880	939160	Like you could turn us into animals again.
939160	942880	Like, you know, and we're the only species that has the power to do that.
942880	944400	We have a self destruct mechanism.
944400	947960	I was thinking that like, this is like a meditation I've had on murder.
947960	952600	Like we can't like, I've had a lot of meditations on murder.
952600	958840	I'll be, uh, do some shows is also famous for that for suppressing their murder meditations,
958840	959840	suppressing violence.
959840	966040	Um, no, but like just one of the humans, obviously they kill people, but at the same time, like
966040	969040	you can't kill someone in existence society.
969040	974780	So like we have to be able to turn people into killers and then also turn them back
974780	978520	from killers into normal people who can like function in society.
978520	982600	Cause otherwise anytime someone would kill, they would become like essentially an unhinged
982600	983600	zombie monster.
983600	987620	You know, like the fact that you can have the regret is like this weird thing.
987620	992380	But what that means is that we can, we can use words and ideas to work ourselves into
992380	995080	a literally a lethal frenzy.
995080	999220	That's only a temporary state of hypnosis that renders us capable of doing things we're
999220	1004580	not normally capable of and wouldn't be capable of if we weren't conceiving of this construct
1004580	1006580	that we invented in our minds.
1006580	1011020	And like, that is like, it's a very human thing, but that's like, it's very crazy.
1011020	1014760	Cause otherwise, you know, if that didn't exist, then all of society would break down.
1014760	1018640	But because that exists, like sociopaths exist, kind of, I don't know, it's really fucked
1018640	1019640	up and scary.
1019640	1020640	Yeah.
1020640	1021640	Yeah.
1021640	1023240	And we all live a lie.
1023240	1026600	I mean, it's like when you examine currency and you go like, well, the dollar's backed
1026600	1030200	by nothing or whatever, like, like everything is a lie.
1030200	1037880	I mean, why are we, yeah, anything that goes beyond any Charles Manson level, like, like
1037880	1042520	sometimes that's why I think we're fascinated with mob mythology or crime, you know, organized
1042520	1046760	crime stuff is because there's a tribal mindset there and it actually, things actually start
1046760	1050480	clicking for us when we watch the Sopranos and we go, I get it.
1050480	1054080	Pauline Walnuts can't tell Lieutenant pecker pickle what to do.
1054080	1058000	I don't have to have a memory.
1058000	1059880	I have imagination.
1059880	1063760	Uh, anyways, let's, let's, let's, let's bring out.
1063760	1065960	That's why tonight's show is all based in anthropology.
1065960	1069520	We've got only the most top qualified experts.
1069520	1070520	I plan this out.
1070520	1072720	The show is meticulously planned and scheduled.
1072720	1074000	I've got the perfect guests.
1074000	1083440	Let's first bring out a Coco, the gorilla is why I guess we'll just bring out Jeff Davis
1083440	1084440	first.
1084440	1094600	Jeff Davis, ladies and gentlemen, Jeff Davis, Jeff Davis, extraordinaire extraordinaire.
1094600	1098760	He could have been anywhere in the world tonight, ladies and gentlemen, but he chose to be here.
1098760	1103480	Jeff Davis, shrub involved visual bit hard to explain.
1103480	1108440	Well, they both did a bit that made me feel like it feels like the Milwaukee public zoo
1108440	1114880	and you're like waiting for the, the, the lions to come out in the winter and you go
1114880	1118840	to the zoo and you're like, how come the lions aren't out because you're, are you freezing
1118840	1120800	your off?
1120800	1125400	They're in the tiny heated room eating hay, but they're lions.
1125400	1126400	That's how cold they are.
1127200	1129800	I don't know that I would compare these motherfuckers to lions.
1131200	1132800	Ladies and gentlemen, Jeff Davis.
1136320	1140840	See, see, see, because a lion would have come out.
1142880	1143760	And this is a bluff.
1143760	1144760	I'm happy to call it.
1149760	1151320	They picked me on the wrong night, man.
1151320	1152320	I'll do it.
1152400	1153400	I know you do.
1153400	1157040	You do have enough in you, I feel like, to talk about without these dudes.
1157040	1158040	Yeah.
1158040	1159040	All right.
1159040	1164440	Another thing about those humans and our ability to create murder and stuff.
1164440	1167680	I think someone almost just got shot by a microphone accessory.
1167680	1168680	What was that?
1168680	1172880	I pulled on the mic cord and then a piece of plastic shot out and almost hit that dude
1172880	1175000	in the face.
1175000	1176120	Just toss it up here.
1176120	1181560	And I will, I will do it again now.
1181560	1185320	Have you ever asked for someone to toss you something and just let it, let it land?
1185320	1186320	Yeah.
1186320	1188440	It's one of the coolest fucking moves.
1188440	1191680	I'm going to tell you right now that that shit was a preemptive strike.
1191680	1196720	I was like, that dude needs a piece of this microphone.
1196720	1197720	Thank you for your help.
1197720	1198720	So much help.
1198720	1199720	Thank you.
1199720	1200720	Sarcasm.
1200720	1201720	God damn it.
1201720	1202720	Yeah.
1202720	1203720	Thank you.
1203720	1204720	I did a lot of driving with Cody.
1204720	1205720	I'll tell you another book.
1205720	1209840	We listened to another book on tape, Elizabeth Smart's story, her autobiography.
1209840	1210840	Remember her?
1211600	1214120	She was a true crime person.
1214120	1215120	Yeah.
1215120	1216120	Yeah.
1216120	1217120	I don't, I don't follow those stories.
1217120	1218120	Well, I don't remember the stories.
1218120	1219120	I followed them like when it happened.
1219120	1220520	I remember the story.
1220520	1224600	I can't remember what, now I can't remember what year it was when it happened, but I do,
1224600	1229280	I was fascinated with the story because I remember she, it became a story because she
1229280	1230280	had returned.
1230280	1231680	It was like a big thing.
1231680	1238480	And I vaguely remember that the, the vagaries and the weird insinuations or questions, it
1238480	1244560	was sort of like my consciousness was like, Oh, is that that girl that got abducted?
1244560	1249160	But she got abducted by a guy that may or may not have, you know, it was like, but the
1249160	1252400	press was like, Oh, she's back, but she may not have been abducted.
1252400	1253400	Maybe she read.
1253400	1256640	It was like, it was like there were, and I was like, so it was really like therapeutic
1256640	1262360	to listen to her, her book because it was like, Oh God, like, like ridiculous.
1262360	1266480	Like the, the narrative of, yeah, of course you're not going to get that right.
1266480	1271080	Like this guy just like came into her room.
1271080	1272080	She was 14 years old.
1272080	1277920	He's got a fucking buoy knife and he's like, get up and get out of bed and come with me.
1277920	1283640	And it's like, it's this crazy experiment and like, what if you were a good girl and
1283640	1288320	you just didn't like, like, what if you just didn't want your family to get hurt and what
1288320	1294280	have you just always, what if you just kept doing what you thought was the smartest, healthiest
1294960	1295960	spiritual thing to do?
1295960	1300040	And the answer is this fucking creep who actually turns out to be like the three stooges of
1300040	1305120	Charles Manson's like it's, it's actually kind of a, you know, if you, if you detach
1305120	1310640	yourself from her, her plight, like the guy emerges as a sort of comedic character.
1310640	1315760	Cause he keeps while he's with her, he takes her, he takes her like out her out of her
1315760	1321680	house and like, like walks with her through thistles and brambles for seven hours where
1321680	1326960	he's got a camp set up where he does the things that you would be afraid that he would
1326960	1327960	do.
1327960	1328960	It's, it's all there.
1328960	1329960	And he says, it's all in his head.
1329960	1330960	It's all about Hill.
1330960	1335080	He's a prophet and he needs a new wife and all this shit, but you know, and she goes
1335080	1341720	there tastefully, but also like it's, it's, it's, it's, she's, she's really very healthy.
1341720	1346560	She's 25 at the time she's writing the book and it's very healthy, very inspiring how
1346560	1350320	like fucking like, she's just like, yeah, then that happened.
1350320	1351880	And like, it's, it's, it's odd.
1351880	1352880	It's honestly odd.
1352880	1354440	I think she's Mormon too, right?
1354440	1359080	Like, cause there, and that is true that when they, when they found her, she wasn't resistant.
1359080	1365480	It wasn't that she, it wasn't that she was complacent about, there's these moments that
1365480	1368640	we don't understand in the story where he's like, like, there's a cop that comes up in
1368640	1374440	the public library and she's sitting there and she's like, she, the cop is like, tell
1374440	1375440	me your name.
1375440	1380640	And there, and like she, we just use logic to go, Oh, well of course now it's time to
1380640	1381640	do this.
1381640	1385200	And so, you know, but it's like, she's abused and she's terrified.
1385200	1389280	The interesting thing about her book is that she swears, like, like she's very adamant
1389280	1392680	about the fact that this is different from Stockholm syndrome, like, like, and she's
1392680	1396040	trying to make the point, she's a victim's rights advocate now.
1396040	1401340	And she's like very, very adamant about this, which I think is just incredibly interesting.
1401340	1405000	If I thought I was a good interviewer at all, and I didn't think that I was going to like,
1406000	1410400	such an interesting person to talk to, but I, I, I would never want to go near somebody
1410400	1414800	that I could ever like accidentally hurt with my insensitivity.
1414800	1420280	But she just seems so fucking robust and so great, greatest revenge.
1420280	1422760	But she's like, she's like, I was never, it's not Stockholm.
1422760	1425640	It's like, I never had empathy for this fucking dunce.
1425640	1427760	I think she, she makes fun of him for the whole book.
1427760	1430080	And it's like, I, I was just, I took him at his word.
1430080	1435320	I was 14 and he was the guy with the knife and he kept saying over and over again, if,
1435320	1436920	if, if this ever ends.
1450920	1453680	Just ignore it.
1453680	1457680	Trying to tell you about a horrible abduction that lasted a year.
1457680	1462280	But she, she, she, she was like, I took him at his word that if this ever ends and it's
1462280	1467640	at all your fault, like if you ever drop the dime on me, you know, like, like I will figure
1467640	1471600	out a way to kill your family, I'll kill your little brother.
1471600	1474400	I'll kill, you know, just over and over again, telling her that.
1474400	1477800	So that's what she's experiencing in these moments when people are coming up to her and
1477800	1480960	going, Hey, are you, are you this kidnapped girl?
1480960	1486440	And she's like, she's screaming in her head.
1486440	1489640	Don't involve me in this shit, fucking save me.
1489640	1491240	It's very, it's very, very interesting.
1491240	1497200	A little bit of a backstory, perhaps about the community that she was raised in and the
1497200	1503160	fact that if you were already mildly abused or if you've already been in a society that
1503160	1507280	integrates women, well, I mean, to abduct you, you may play along.
1507280	1508280	Yeah.
1508280	1510720	I mean, like, like advocacy afterwards sounds like
1516440	1527240	Now, you know, it's thrown, it's just thrown.
1527240	1528480	I'm proud of you guys.
1528480	1535800	That was a good taper, like, obviously we can't coordinate total silence and, and, you
1535800	1539760	know, some of you come here because you hate me, but if you, if you, if you want to make
1539760	1547040	me fucking proud, let them, let them, let them stew and just try as hard as you can.
1547040	1549200	Just fucking abject silence.
1549200	1552880	They really shouldn't have to work for your love at this point.
1552880	1557000	Don't do it because you think I go, I'm gay, you know, you want me to win.
1557000	1558640	You know, I know you love them.
1558640	1566720	If you love them, teach them a lesson, teach them a lesson about stagecraft and respect.
1567720	1572080	Now, back to Elizabeth Smart.
1572080	1575280	But I really want to address that because it's like, I mean, like, that's the thing
1575280	1579840	is like we, I believe her family was Mormon, but it's noteworthy that you wouldn't know
1579840	1583920	that from reading the book because I think her fate, you know, she was never like, well,
1583920	1587680	because of my magic underwear was protected or all this stuff, like it's very clear that
1587680	1591880	the dude is Mormon, that this like psycho is Mormon and that he's abusing all these
1591880	1593320	tenants of Mormonism.
1593320	1594960	It's like, like that he's twisted it.
1595040	1599720	The only thing that's clear with her is that she's basically like the American goal.
1599720	1604800	And I think that's what's important is that we think, oh, we want our 14 year old daughters
1604800	1612320	to be, you know, unsoiled and never have had any thoughts into their head.
1612320	1616320	It's like sort of an interesting, like kind of Christ myth when you're listening to it
1616320	1622080	because you're like, well, this is supposedly the American dream as far as what you want
1622080	1624680	your family to have this white picket fence and all these things.
1624680	1631280	And it's like, there is this thought in your head that goes like, well, and then she's
1631280	1645400	so pure and modest and humble and so it's like this doofus who has no right, like he's
1645400	1646400	exploiting it.
1646400	1652040	Like she doesn't know she's being exploited and she's not, she's, yeah, it's a real roller
1652040	1656920	coaster that you go through when you're listening to the story, which is why I kind of, it was
1656920	1660400	kind of eye opening to me because the other half of the time, all your thinking is as
1660400	1664800	in that South Park episode where they meet the Mormon, like the, it's like, like the
1664800	1667880	other half of the time you're going, Jesus Christ, I got to convert to this fucking religion
1667880	1670360	because this is some powerful shit.
1670360	1677560	Like this girl survived some crazy shit and it was specifically because of her faith faith.
1677560	1683320	These brand names get us fucked up, Christianity, Catholicism, the names get us fucked up.
1683320	1684320	Yeah.
1684320	1688400	Her faith, she thought that there was a God with her the whole time that was like, and
1688400	1690720	she's not shoving that down your throat in case you want to listen to the book.
1690720	1695440	It's like, it's not like she's like selling that to you, but, but she just, she uses the
1695440	1701160	force a couple of times and she doesn't, she's not obnoxious about it.
1701160	1702360	I think it's really interesting.
1702360	1706320	It's also, she narrates her own audio book, which is like cool because she's like sort
1706320	1711720	of like, it's like amateur, like, like, like, she's like, like, like, like she, her inflection
1711720	1716920	is like, this is the real person and she's, she's like, I didn't know she's describing
1716920	1721120	this like doofus going like today I'm going to, she's like mocking him with her voice.
1721120	1725720	And then he came back to me, well, I just decided that God wants me to do this.
1725720	1727720	And I'm like, all right, whatever.
1727720	1735000	And you're trying to tell me that Selena Gomez could play this role.
1735000	1739600	I think that the feeling that left me with a net positive was like, wow, you could be
1739600	1744360	a 14 year old girl and have the worst possible fucking thing happen to you for a year of
1744360	1746680	your life and you could emerge.
1746680	1751480	She was like, she's just a regular person, like, like, and, and, and if, and she actually
1751480	1755120	keeps pointing out, she's like, actually, she doesn't want to say I'm glad this happened.
1755120	1759720	She's but, but she's like, I, I'm grateful for, she's like, if it hadn't happened, what
1759720	1760720	would I be?
1760720	1766480	Some snook that doesn't know how bad it can get like, also you statistically, she's very
1766480	1767920	lucky to be alive.
1767920	1775200	So God, I mean, yeah, as far as yeah, the percentage of people who have had a dude come
1775200	1776760	into their bedroom with a knife.
1776760	1783600	Yeah, she's one of the, she's, God, yeah, it's a pretty short book.
1783600	1785040	It's kind of interesting.
1785040	1789480	I like, it's such a weird, it's like the three stooges of abductions.
1789480	1792840	And it is inspirational because somebody actually lived through it.
1792840	1798480	Because of her because it's inspirational because she's like, she, yeah, she, she's,
1798480	1801640	she's on her own and she just kind of gets, she just survives.
1801640	1806520	And it's a bummer of the culture where survival is the new success, but sometimes that's the
1806520	1810400	thing you need to remind yourself of, I guess, I don't know.
1811400	1820040	My personal journey has gone from, I am happy in spite of you, you being you listening.
1820040	1823000	And I crossed a threshold at a certain point and I am happy because of you.
1823000	1824000	And that was glorious.
1824000	1826400	That was great.
1826400	1829120	And I am, I am now entering my third active.
1829120	1834680	I am now again, happy in spite of you.
1834680	1839480	And I know that if you are a fan of mine, you don't blame me for that.
1839560	1845000	And that's why I love you, but like, I can't, I can't keep coming to you for happiness.
1845000	1849680	I got to be, I got to be 45 years old and be like, here's how you're happy.
1849680	1857120	If a 14 year old girl can do that in a fucking tent where she's actually being like, I really,
1857120	1866200	I really, I feel you, you really, you truly believed that everyone was, that was, that
1866200	1867960	was true belief applause.
1867960	1868960	That was not.
1869200	1871360	He was like, I'm starting this shit, I'm starting it.
1871360	1872880	That was not like Beastie Boys, like irony generation applause.
1872880	1875280	Like, yeah, that was like, he was like.
1875280	1879880	I am shocked that you all did not help your boy out.
1879880	1883040	But don't feel ashamed because you're fine the way you are.
1883040	1887040	Just next time, sit at the back of the house, then they'll all hear it and be like, whoop,
1887040	1888040	whoop, whoop, whoop.
1888040	1892760	If you do it down front, people are like, look at this dumb motherfucker.
1892760	1894560	It's funny.
1894560	1899440	He was the one who was like excited that you were embracing internal forms of motivation
1899440	1904000	and everyone else, like they didn't clap at all because they weren't similarly internally
1904000	1906400	motivated to clap.
1906400	1910320	You know, it does make you internally motivated to clap me undies.
1910320	1912200	Really?
1912200	1914080	Would you be wearing me undies this evening?
1914080	1915080	Oh, of course.
1915080	1918200	I've been wearing them like much like first class travel.
1918200	1919440	I have never gone back.
1919440	1923920	Is it the softness or the fit?
1923920	1926440	It's the cockpit.
1926440	1929440	They should call it the cockpit.
1929440	1936280	They could call it me undies if you're listening, the cockpit, the diamond pouch, call it the
1936280	1937280	cockpit.
1937280	1938440	It's good.
1938440	1940040	I'm wearing them right now.
1940040	1944360	I've never worn them before today and I'm wearing them on my body.
1944360	1949040	And I got to tell you, it feels like I'm wearing nothing at all.
1949040	1950040	Nothing at all.
1950040	1951040	I'm interested to talk to it.
1951040	1952040	Nothing at all.
1952040	1953040	To it.
1953040	1954040	To it.
1954040	1959520	You think, wouldn't you like to meet a person that had tried me undies and then was like,
1959520	1961120	no, I'm going back to regular.
1961120	1962120	Yeah.
1962120	1964720	What kind of monster is that?
1964720	1971120	Someone who doesn't like just the right amount of support and comfort.
1971120	1973800	The kind of person who says caviar is too salty.
1973800	1974800	We're not even going to look back.
1974800	1977680	We're not even going to look behind us.
1977680	1985440	And we don't need to because coming through the house, whoa, now they're coming in from
1985440	1986440	the bag.
1986440	1987440	So proud of you.
1987440	1988440	So proud of you.
1988440	1989440	Which is impossible to do.
1989440	1990440	This is actually a really good job.
1990440	1991440	Oh, you broke at the end.
1991440	1992440	You held out for a long time.
1992440	2016680	This is why you can subscribe to the Harman town feed and see what's happening because
2016680	2017680	it's hard to explain.
2017680	2018680	This is why they're not trustworthy.
2018680	2030560	No, but these guys, I mean, that I, when I, when I said, don't clap, I, I, it's, uh,
2030560	2032200	you guys, that was amazing.
2032200	2033200	Yeah.
2033200	2034200	You did.
2034200	2035200	So much better.
2035200	2036200	I was the first one to cry uncle.
2036200	2039080	I was like, oh, that feels so harsh.
2039080	2044080	Like, like the music started and I was like, well, why aren't you?
2044080	2045080	Oh, oh, right.
2045080	2048080	And you guys are like, no fucking, like, it was like, it was like, it was like, oh, oh,
2048600	2051560	it was like, wow, that is, that's homo sapiens.
2051560	2053480	That's how we beat the Neanderthals.
2053480	2061920	That's also, also children of divorce because they were like, I know how to be pit against
2061920	2064560	another adult.
2064560	2069240	I want to, I want to watch any tree fall.
2069240	2070240	Hand me an ax.
2070240	2075760	My, my joy comes from the two damage to submit.
2075760	2076760	We can't conform.
2076760	2077760	We're freaking out.
2077760	2084080	Uh, yeah, I can't wait to, I can't wait to hear the rest of that, that, that sapiens
2084080	2085080	book.
2085080	2087000	Uh, do you want to talk about the dog door?
2087000	2088000	Uh, yeah.
2088000	2091840	Cause I, I didn't want to talk about it for a while while it was going on just because
2091840	2096640	I didn't want to advertise that my house had a malfunctioning dog door out of any kind.
2096640	2097640	Right.
2097640	2101680	Cause I didn't want people to be like, some, some guys like sharpening his knife on a whetstone.
2101680	2106480	And he's like, did you hear episode three 21?
2106480	2111280	He says the back door has a piece of plexiglass on it that keeps coming up every time the
2111280	2113720	dog comes near it.
2113720	2117760	And then they just have all these posters of me on the wall with like the eyes cut out.
2117760	2122520	Try not to, try not to hit his garage this time.
2122520	2128960	Uh, but now that now the old, the old doors back installed and I, I don't know.
2128960	2131120	I thought it was such a funny.
2131200	2134600	I, yeah, I feel like you might want to at least take lead.
2134600	2139600	I mean, I'll fill in and add and take, take, pick up the slack, but I don't know what angle
2139600	2141320	you're coming at this from.
2141320	2147360	And I had this thought in my head that, which maybe some of you have, which I'm happy that
2147360	2152800	I can relieve you of, which is the idea that with money comes this ability to like, just
2152800	2159440	sort of like, like make things happen, like, like, like, like, like without, without, without
2159440	2163640	caring about them, like, well, I'm, I'm rich now.
2163640	2166760	So the dog door is not perfect.
2166760	2170840	Like I, I, and I, now I can't even remember what wasn't perfect about the dog door because
2170840	2177640	now I want to kiss the dog door I have, but, uh, it, it, I was like, why can't there be
2177640	2186840	a dog door that, uh, doesn't need batteries changed in it, uh, and doesn't require batteries
2186840	2190480	to be changed in a fob in the dog's collars because they make these dog doors where the
2190480	2194680	dog gets close to the dog door and that's when the dog door opens or unlocks.
2194680	2197680	And, uh, this is kind of a list of shit.
2197680	2202200	And also I was like, and inevitably like, I'd like it to be electronic also because
2202200	2206840	I have a Crestron system, like a home automation system, which has also never worked, but one
2206920	2211480	day I have this idea that I'll be sitting in my bed and I'll be like, did you hear that, honey?
2218280	2220240	What was that? Sounds like coyotes.
2224560	2226800	By the way, that's exactly what coyotes sound like.
2230560	2233560	That's why they're fucking terrifying because they don't sound like an animal.
2233560	2240600	They sound like a fucking dude at Target, like arguing with his girlfriend.
2240600	2243120	They just sound, you're just like, what's going on out there?
2243120	2244280	Why is there a dude?
2244280	2247240	Why is there a gang of dudes upset about a sale?
2247560	2249600	And it's like, and then you listen and they're like, what?
2249840	2251320	Oh God, it's coyotes.
2251640	2256200	And then, and then the scariest thing about it is that then your dogs, they hear the coyotes
2256200	2260840	and they're like, they react in these random fucking ways, sometimes sexually.
2261800	2262640	Uh-huh.
2264200	2265560	Like you can't tell the difference.
2265560	2268080	Like you know how your dog reacts to a skunk or a raccoon?
2268120	2269040	They get excited.
2269200	2275080	Like if there's a fucking coyote out there, the dogs are like, they're like, so they're
2275080	2276640	like the call of the wild.
2276640	2278080	They're like, I want to go with the circus.
2278080	2280120	I'm like, these motherfuckers want to eat you.
2280200	2280520	Yeah.
2280800	2282360	They're not, they're going to fuck you.
2282360	2284320	If they do fuck you, they're going to eat you after.
2284320	2285920	Like they don't take, they don't give a shit.
2285920	2291440	These are hungry ass wild cave dogs from like the fucking last millennia come down
2291440	2294440	here to like fucking eat squirrels and chihuahuas.
2294720	2298720	And don't, don't, but the dogs are like, they hear it and they're like, I want to go out
2298720	2298920	there.
2298920	2303000	I want to, and then, and then it's just, you hear, it's like, it's the scariest thing in
2303000	2304440	the world to hear these.
2308880	2314880	So anyways, I'm just saying like my fantasy was to deal with that and then hit a button
2314920	2316680	and be like, okay, that's enough of that.
2316800	2321520	Like, I'm not letting my dogs out or like they sometimes you smell a little skunk in
2321520	2324240	the air and then your dogs are like, man, there's a skunk out there.
2324240	2328520	And they're like, that means it's time for me to go attack the skunk and then you can
2328520	2331480	bathe me for eight hours and then you can change your cushions.
2331480	2334280	And then you go, no, it means it's time to lock the door.
2334400	2334640	Yeah.
2335080	2336840	So I had this fantasy.
2336840	2342200	So, you know, like electronic and dog collar activated.
2342200	2345080	So they could, they could pick and choose when they want to go outside.
2346040	2351320	But if I want to seal them in for the evening because of mother nature, I hit the
2351320	2351720	button.
2351960	2352440	Okay.
2352600	2353680	All of that from my bed.
2354040	2359120	So Spencer, like the whole time for like, for like the last two years, it seems like
2359120	2360720	like Spencer's like, I got it.
2360760	2364440	Like, like this is technically Spencer's job, but it's not really fair to Spencer.
2364480	2367480	Like I, I, I don't, it's like, it's just long term.
2367480	2370720	Like it's hard to crack one of these things out really quick.
2370720	2372400	So as a result, it's like, I don't know.
2372440	2372760	Yeah.
2372760	2376280	It's like, it's like, it's like Levi's in charge of like the calendar and the
2376280	2377080	finances, all that shit.
2377080	2381960	And like Spencer's like my friend, but yeah, also like I'm, it's like, it's like,
2382000	2385280	oh, it's like, it's like, oh, there's a video game.
2385280	2387000	Can you get it for me or something like that?
2387000	2391320	It's kind of like, like, but, but like here, and it's like, it's like, it's not like,
2391360	2394440	it's not like I'm ever like Spencer's fucking up because there's not a thing.
2394680	2398600	It's like, and Spencer does it also knows he's like, I'm not going to bug my friend
2398600	2399480	about the thing.
2399480	2403840	And like, like, like for, for a year and a half or something, I'm like, what about
2403840	2405280	this dog door?
2405280	2407000	And then you'd come in and you'd go, okay.
2407000	2408680	So I got, I found this dog door.
2409080	2412040	So it meets your specifications and I'm always like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2412040	2412520	That's great.
2412520	2413200	That's fine.
2413640	2417240	And then, and then sometimes you, I think back in my head and you're like, yeah,
2417240	2419360	it's kind of big and I'm like, yeah, whatever.
2419360	2420080	My dog's big.
2420600	2423840	And then like, and then other times they're like, oh, it kind of sticks out from the
2423840	2426560	door, like when you stall it, I'm like, whatever.
2426560	2429120	I don't, I'm not a fucking, I'm not Martha Stewart.
2429160	2431520	I don't care function over form.
2431520	2437840	Let's Elon Musk, this dog door cut to the dog door is installed finally.
2437840	2442320	Like it's like, this is the funniest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life.
2442600	2445480	It was this giant like picture of back door.
2445520	2448640	So first of all, the back door had to be completely replaced because the dog door
2448640	2455800	is so big that no door, no normal door can contain it because it's basically the
2455800	2457120	size of a door.
2457120	2457600	Yeah.
2458480	2462760	The dog door is so big that if Spencer and I like we're going out for the evening,
2462760	2464720	we might, and we were wearing collars.
2464720	2469680	We might just actually put less energy into leaving the house by ducking down
2469680	2470760	and moving through the door.
2470760	2472080	That's how big the dog door is.
2472520	2475680	I compared it to the size of a not mini fridge.
2478200	2483640	I'd say it's, it's like a fridge in size hanging off the door.
2483840	2492240	It's, it's, it's certainly the size of a chubby criminal on a full on adult hasn't
2492240	2497760	even earned being in your house because he's not even, he's fat from his last robbery.
2497760	2502360	And he's just like, well, you know, as long as I'm here, I will maintain,
2502400	2505880	I feel like the, your dog is almost, is also that size.
2505880	2506240	Yes.
2506240	2507080	That's the problem.
2507120	2507400	Yeah.
2507400	2510760	But my dog ain't going to do shit about the robber.
2510800	2511040	Yeah.
2511040	2512200	I mean, like, you know,
2512280	2514480	do you, uh, do you ever think about a fence?
2515440	2516240	Oh, we have one.
2516240	2518440	I got fences to beat the band.
2518960	2519360	Okay.
2520520	2521040	Okay.
2521560	2526000	Like, like, well, before you don't, you know, like, if I've learned one thing,
2526000	2528920	it's that I should have been happy with just being a caveman and letting my
2528920	2532360	fucking Dino out into the backyard with the Bronto burgers.
2532360	2538320	Like I get it now, but I thought in my head, I thought, Oh, you get money.
2538320	2540880	And then you start doing this James Bond thing where you're like, you
2540880	2544240	could like weave your, you do the minority report in your bed and then your
2544240	2547280	dog is like happier than if you were a regular dog owner.
2547760	2549000	It's all untrue.
2549040	2549800	It's not true.
2549840	2553800	Like, no matter how much money you get, you can't, you can't, your dog just
2553800	2559920	needs to be let out and then let in after it shits and yet you got to care
2559920	2560640	about a living thing.
2560680	2561040	All right.
2561080	2562280	There's no end run around it.
2563320	2564160	I'm sorry to tell you.
2564200	2566400	So you may as well go back to your shitty job tomorrow.
2566400	2569160	I want a living smile on your face because no matter how many promotions you
2569160	2571840	get, you're never going to get to stop caring about fucking people.
2574760	2576800	Weird when you don't laugh at shit like that.
2576800	2579960	It's like, why did you buy a ticket?
2580000	2582120	I thought you liked my lack of empathy.
2584680	2589360	Anyways, but the fucking dog and the so heart Nigel fucking loves the thing.
2589360	2594120	Nigel's like the shitty little dog that doesn't need anything because Nigel will
2594120	2595520	find a way out of anything.
2595760	2599360	Like Nigel, you could just, you could raise him in an environment that was like
2599360	2603440	hermetically sealed, but like, like he'd figure out how to get out anyway.
2603600	2605440	No, I sent Nigel out for pizza the other day.
2607720	2608800	So he like loves it.
2608800	2612640	He walks up to it, this giant plexiglass guillotine goes.
2615480	2617000	It's nine feet tall.
2617040	2622400	Nigel like looks at it, walks right through and he goes and shit some
2622400	2625320	pisses and does what he eats his fucking rocks and twigs.
2625320	2627600	So I'll have to give him unnecessary surgery later.
2627600	2628280	He comes back.
2630320	2638560	Harvey is like, Harvey, Harvey spent the three weeks that this thing was installed.
2638560	2642000	Just like, like, like shitting everywhere in the house.
2643320	2647200	While Nigel just ran in and out, I would let the both of them out.
2647200	2649760	Like, like Nigel would come back in and Harvey would just sit there and go,
2652480	2658280	like, like, please, and then I, I, like, and he, like, he can't, like the thing
2658280	2661320	makes a sound that makes him like cower away from it.
2661640	2662840	I can't say I blame him.
2662840	2664800	I mean, it looks like a guillotine.
2665360	2668800	He thinks Harvey is, he thinks Harvey or Nigel is going to another world.
2669880	2673360	He's like, I am not going into that portal at all.
2673400	2677840	My heart is like, if you ever, I don't know if, you know, some of you may have
2677840	2680720	kids and like, I know parents, like I've talked to parents and I know that they
2680720	2682960	always secretly have a favorite if they have two kids.
2683680	2686920	I know it's a thing that you don't admit and that you can't because legally
2686920	2691400	with the parent guilt, there's two kids and I know that parents with two kids,
2691400	2695040	they always go like, well, Monica's like, she's the jam.
2697120	2700720	And Toby's kind of a prick, but we love him because he's our kid.
2700720	2704040	Like you get that when you have a kid, I get from parents that they go like, you
2704040	2706760	know what, one of the great things about being a parent is you realize that your
2706760	2708960	job is to just bring another shithead into the world.
2709200	2713080	Like that you get, you quickly get over this idea that you're like, well, I'm
2713080	2717560	Leopold the third, I can't wait for Leopold the fourth to prove I was right
2717560	2718560	about my thirding.
2719440	2721360	You're quickly like, okay, what's that?
2721400	2722480	I eat cardboard.
2722520	2723440	Okay, fine.
2724640	2727880	I guess that's what you were going to do no matter where you were raised.
2727920	2730000	Like, I'll just keep you from getting arrested.
2730040	2730520	Yeah.
2731160	2734600	And so anyway, so that, so that's why parents like after a few margaritas,
2734600	2738240	they'll go, yeah, I like our daughter, but I don't like our son.
2739960	2745120	And I get it having two dogs because I'm like, uh, Nigel, my parents are
2745120	2745920	going to hate you for that.
2747120	2748280	They can hate me all I want.
2748320	2751400	They are hating their shame.
2751440	2752400	Yes, they're ashamed.
2753000	2753480	I got it.
2753840	2756640	If you're a parent and you're out there and you're like, I love my kids equally.
2756680	2758400	Well, then I guess I'm not talking about you.
2759960	2761200	Like, so why are you mad?
2761400	2761560	Yeah.
2762920	2768600	You know, like suck my, uh, no kid dick.
2769000	2773240	Yeah, like, like, like, like, here I am on my throne of no kids.
2773280	2776000	I'm telling you fucking you hate your kids.
2777360	2778600	No one knows that better than me.
2780120	2780960	I got dogs.
2781160	2787960	I'm just saying I get like Harvey, Harvey is the smartest dog I've ever met in my
2787960	2790920	life. He watches television.
2791280	2797160	He, when he sees things on television that are supposed to excite him, he gets
2797160	2799080	excited. I can't get mad at him.
2799120	2801600	He's like, it's like, it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2801640	2802360	Here's reindeer.
2802360	2805680	And he's like, this year, there's deer.
2805680	2807640	There's a whole shit ton of deer.
2808240	2810120	And I'm like, Harvey, Harvey, take it easy.
2810120	2811520	And he's like, you take it easy.
2811520	2814200	There's a fucking window with deer.
2815160	2818960	And I can't, I can't get mad at him because it's like, well, Nigel's just like,
2818960	2820280	what, what he gets mad at.
2820400	2822200	He just starts barking at Harvey.
2822200	2822920	And I just does it.
2823520	2826680	Nigel's just like, his eyes don't move at the same frame rate or.
2827800	2829480	I don't know what the fuck I tried.
2829480	2831800	I tried to get clarity on this from scientists.
2831800	2833640	And Nigel probably just knows it's TV.
2834280	2835280	I know.
2837320	2839960	And he just like, hey, it's a television show.
2842080	2847800	I know Nigel seems a little more attuned to like the audio, like podcasts and stuff.
2847800	2848840	Maybe I don't know.
2848840	2849920	I'm trying to give him credit.
2849920	2852200	But the thing is, it's like Nigel's the jock.
2852200	2854200	Like Nigel can catch a ball.
2854200	2854880	You throw it in the air.
2854880	2856720	Like Nigel gets everything.
2856720	2858440	Like Nigel like hacks everything.
2858440	2859160	He's a mutt.
2859640	2862280	He's like, he's like a little grimy little street urchin.
2862640	2866640	And, and so you should be, you want, I want him to be me.
2866640	2868120	I want him to be a carbon copy of me.
2868120	2869400	I want to be like, I'm Punky Brewster.
2869400	2870280	He's Punky Brewster.
2870280	2871440	He's my adopted kid.
2871440	2873240	I want to be, I want to have that bond.
2873480	2876200	But no, Harvey's my kid because he's homeschooled.
2876200	2877280	He's from a breeder.
2877480	2882920	He's afraid of not being liked to the point where he's, he can figure out way
2882920	2887480	before anyone not likes him, like that he's so sad that he should like maybe
2887480	2889080	piss in a fountain.
2889080	2891840	Like when you come home, he's oops, sorry, I did that now.
2891840	2897960	But he's like so sensitive and intelligent and intuitive that he's, he's got this
2897960	2900120	little brother that gets to eat before him.
2900120	2905680	And like, like, he's like, eh, like, like, I love, I mean, like, have you ever, if
2905680	2909880	you have two kids, is it the one that reminds you the most of yourself that
2909880	2911040	you like the least?
2911320	2912400	That's my question.
2913480	2915040	Send your emails to.
2916720	2919440	To why is this happening to me, Dot Dad?
2921280	2922480	That's a great question.
2922640	2923880	That is a really great question.
2924480	2929360	Because like, I think if your kid's created and funny, and that's what you think you
2929360	2930280	are, you love that kid.
2930640	2933720	But if you're not funny, then you hate that kid.
2934800	2938960	But like, also, the ideal, right, is that you get you're so you get your shit so
2939000	2941880	together that you're like, OK, I got a kid now.
2942160	2946840	And you're like, eh, I live my life like that, that that's the ideal parent.
2946880	2951480	You're not supposed to like, like, oh, he's a little soccer player, ain't he?
2951520	2953320	You're a little soccer player.
2953320	2955440	And then like, get mad like that.
2955440	2958800	They're like, I don't know, soccer is OK, but I like the trombone.
2958800	2961000	And you're like, what's that fucking dick flute you're playing?
2963160	2966680	Yeah, you just you don't even know you're doing it like that's the cartoonish
2966680	2972240	example, like none of us would do that or some people really have a set goal for their
2972240	2973720	kids, what they want them to do.
2973720	2974520	They put them in shit.
2974520	2978600	They give them little jobs and some people don't and they get a president out of it.
2979320	2983400	The one thing we all know is that you can't there's there's it's hands off.
2983440	2986680	Yeah, you just hope that they don't get a gun and a rifle tower.
2986920	2991920	Really, I got to say, I'm really impressed with I've said it before, like I the only
2991920	2995400	reason I think I have the capacity to have kids is because of Cody's sister.
2995400	3000040	She's got her kids and like I swear I was like I was like when they were younger, I
3000040	3002520	was like, you can't fucking raise a kid like that.
3002520	3006680	You kidding me, like, like talking to him like they're an equal and that's the problem
3006680	3007920	with our society and all this shit.
3007920	3012520	But it's like, like, no, she's like it's like it's like this, like it's like this
3012520	3017800	like consequences and rule that the kids understand the rules and they also understand
3017800	3022040	the most important thing about rules is that actually if it's a fucking if you really are
3022040	3026600	if you really got a bunch of sand in your crack, you can well, you really want to bend
3026600	3031640	those rules because they're negotiable on the back end of the front end like like
3031640	3034080	tell me what the rules about the same in the cracker.
3035640	3040640	No, I'm saying if your kids like you're avoiding the because I said so thing because
3040640	3042560	because I said so that ain't no rule.
3042600	3046640	That's not even a rule in prison because I said so don't even apply in prison lately.
3046640	3050600	Like they don't even like you're in prison and you know that like you can well if you
3050600	3055120	really fucking want it, you can get whatever you you know, like you can bend the rules.
3055120	3058120	So like and that's where we send the people that we hate the most that we don't even
3058120	3059800	care if they ever learn anything.
3059800	3063480	Like we're really unfair to those people were like, oh, well, you're going to the pits of
3063480	3066000	hell where you should just fucking suffer for the rest of your life.
3066280	3070280	And even there, like if you if you want a cigarette, you can get a cigarette.
3070280	3072000	If you want to lock pick, you can get a lock pick.
3072000	3079880	And like it so like it's that I like that I like those conversations where like parents
3079880	3083800	are having with their kids where they're like, hey, like what what do you what do you
3083800	3084640	complain about?
3085080	3090480	I want to watch Peppa Pig, you know, and like, well, so and so and so you wanted to watch
3090480	3091640	Peppa Pig so bad you did.
3091920	3092920	What did you just do?
3093080	3093560	Why am I?
3094000	3095360	Why are we having this conversation?
3095760	3099360	I hit someone in the head with a fire truck.
3100240	3104120	And so so do you think we're going to watch Peppa Pig now because of that?
3104120	3105760	Like like just having these conversations.
3105760	3107400	It's kind of like kind of sounds fun.
3107400	3114360	It's almost like it it it is better that we don't baby talk like we used to.
3114440	3117960	There used to be that thing where we talked to kids and now you really do look at a kid
3117960	3121600	and you go, do you want the Bacardi or do you want the right?
3124680	3127480	It's easier on everybody if we can just have a conversation.
3127480	3127880	Yeah.
3127880	3128920	And this is this coach.
3128920	3132600	And I think there has to be kind of a line there like like like probably says the parental
3132600	3134160	expert on his podcast about.
3135080	3140560	But but it's that guy that I never want to be and that put me off of kids is that guy
3140560	3141920	behind me on the airplane.
3142160	3147560	It's the it's the working class Chris Pratt dad that's flying first class and it has that
3147560	3148040	kid with them.
3148040	3152760	And you just hear this like almost one sided dialogue with this guy is like, well, hey,
3152760	3153720	bro, what do you want?
3154080	3154600	What do you want?
3154680	3155760	Oh, you want to do that, bro?
3155800	3156640	What do you think, dude?
3156720	3157920	Hey, guy, what do you think?
3157960	3159080	Oh, that'd be awesome.
3159120	3159640	Oh, yeah.
3159640	3160800	What is your shoe, a spaceship?
3160840	3161560	Oh, man, guy.
3161600	3162440	Oh, that's amazing.
3163080	3166760	And it's just kind of I feel like kids pick up on the insincerity before they pick up on
3166760	3167320	language.
3167320	3170200	Like the kids like to is like, I think my dad's a dick.
3170200	3173280	I don't have the I don't have the words for it yet.
3173280	3176240	But I think I'm being raised by like Chris Pratt and I don't like it.
3177400	3181600	Like that's all I know about you is that you're a fucking like mock enthusiast about every
3181600	3182680	fucking thing I do.
3182680	3184040	Like I don't know what to trust.
3184080	3188400	Like what is it that I do that's actually gratifying my shoes, a spaceship?
3188400	3195800	Go suck my tiny little they do they look they do it.
3195800	3202120	We as a society, we sort of roll out the red carpet for the first 10 and then after 10
3202120	3203720	we're like motherfucker get a job.
3204720	3206520	You'll see me asking you for shit.
3206600	3210600	That's not fair, but that's also that's the problem is like with the kids get gangly and
3210600	3212000	then we start being like fuck you.
3212640	3213560	Like that's a problem.
3213560	3217480	That's a big problem because it reinforces the thing is like we could like blend it a
3217480	3223640	little bit like where it's like hey like look I'm not yeah like look you just talk to
3223640	3225040	him like a fucking dude.
3225080	3230440	I think the baby talk is instinctive to us because literally like I think there's a I
3230440	3235640	think the reason why when we look at a baby we go boop boop boop boop is because we because
3235640	3241920	the babies like are like the CPU that's like fucking booting and like we know that they
3241920	3245160	actually if we didn't do that if you raised a baby in an environment where they weren't
3245160	3250560	surrounded by hominid faces that were constantly going hey don't we got boop it out like that
3250560	3255600	they wouldn't start going people but you know that they're experimenting with it and then they
3255600	3263520	turn to and then they go past the salt and whoa yeah that is true if you don't talk to your
3263520	3266880	babies they don't start talking and you can tell kids that haven't been spoken.
3266880	3273680	Oh look who's here speaking of babies that need to be spoken to maybe we can try some of these
3273680	3274680	techniques.
3274680	3276480	Are you ready to come out?
3276480	3282880	Did you did you did you have a good time in your special place Rob?
3282880	3285240	Excuse me.
3285240	3288760	Did you do are you feeling better now?
3288760	3299440	About about stage time and when to come out and yeah I'm okay with it.
3299440	3302880	Okay I love you.
3302880	3307800	I love you too Daniel.
3307800	3316040	Maybe tomorrow we'll go to the sunflower patch all right I'm trying to think of what kids
3316040	3323720	like I'm going down a list of like what I would hate to ever do.
3323720	3330280	Yeah yeah that sounds awful Disneyland that sounds worse what if you could just have a
3330280	3338280	kid that was into Minecraft like out of the box like oh box as unfortunate figured out
3338280	3344960	of the from the get-go like if they were like they're just like gaga goo goo and then you're
3344960	3351520	like Minecraft and they're like Minecraft I would I just saw a baby that would like
3351520	3356840	sit on a laptop next to me and it'd be like what are you what are you doing over there
3356840	3360960	and they'd be like I'm making a wheatgarden and I'd be like cool can I do you want me
3360960	3369080	to help you with stuff cuz I'll I can simulate being a father yeah that would be that would
3369080	3376400	be so cool that'd be great I'd say it would be so cool my post-production supervisor and
3376400	3381760	community he had two kids and he said when I was he would go he said oh I'm into Minecraft
3381760	3389120	because he saw me playing it while I was editing community that's right well and then also in
3389120	3397880	addition to that probably wrote a blog in my head be amazed go ahead but he was like oh you
3397880	3402560	Minecraft and he's like I play that with my kids and he had to like a server at his home and he
3402560	3408080	would go home and play with his kids it was like a digital sandbox a dad playing with his two kids
3408080	3415080	Minecraft you know you can drink with them too once they well once they stop caring about Minecraft
3415080	3422160	but that I would be like yeah I'd be like don't like that would be my big thing with my kid it'd
3422160	3426560	be like I don't like Minecraft I want a drink I'm like dude what do you think I've been doing the
3426560	3436800	whole time you have get a drink and come back and play Minecraft what my drinking's my Minecraft
3436800	3447280	don't ever say that again do Minecraft was your drinking did I get that right you need some more
3447280	3455640	ice Schwab Schwab do you have nieces and nephews yeah I think so and ballpark me on their ages
3455640	3463760	what's that ballpark me on their ages how old am I I think I have one that's three ish and the other
3463760	3472000	one that's five ish Schwab you want to talk about this guy this guy I did the video doesn't really

3479120	3486480	don't know this intersection what planet we're in retrograde I think there's five planets in
3486480	3497760	retrograde I think there's five planets there was I think they went back I mean is that what
3497760	3506400	retro means retrograde means they went back they went back a grade yeah and I think that's happened
3506400	3515280	because like for the past couple of days things have been effed up my Spotify got hacked you're
3515440	3525680	Spotify got hacked by far my weakest password the weakest password car got broken into whoa and my
3525680	3535040	keys my car keys not that didn't have Kate's car key on it we're in it I I we walked we want it

3800080	3817920	States um uh also his uh gym membership username is Robbie's robot um the uh but it's every you've
3817920	3824160	been living there forever and it's like this intersection where clearly like it needs to stop
3824400	3831360	the government has decided that putting a stop sign there creates a like uh they looked at it
3831360	3837200	from a bird's eye or like well if you put a stop sign there the city will shut down it will it's
3837200	3843360	like putting a clot in a thing and they're like well how many car accidents are there uh the most
3843360	3849680	ever like okay but per year like so on average they look at the whole circulatory system of
3849680	3853680	the city and they're like so keep letting there be car accidents and let the insurance companies
3854160	3861360	because because unlike a stop sign those only happen once in a while so I'm replying to my emails
3863360	3869280	and I'm replying and I'm replying and I'm replying and all of a sudden I hear
3875600	3877600	Michael Winslow was outside your door

3933120	3938800	and we see an Armenian woman going oh my goodness oh my goodness going back and forth
3938800	3948800	and this other guy going oh my god oh my god you ruined my life you ruined my life I had this car
3948800	3956720	for three days I can't make a living without my car and you ruined my life you ruined my life
3957280	3966960	cut two three hours later oh my god you ruined my life you ruined my life when you first told me
3966960	3973440	you said you heard this guy say I ruined my life and I was like I was like oh god like what if
3973440	3979040	he was like a marathon runner and his leg was broken or anything like he's a pianist and his
3979680	3986640	fingers are shattered pianist got hurt like uh if he was Dr. Strange and his knuckles I needed
3986640	3992880	voodoo magic to um the the I don't think Dr. Strange was strange enough I know you worked on
3992880	3999040	the movie look I didn't he seemed pretty normal he was like believe me I was brought in there
3999040	4004720	excuse me pardon me that is exactly how are you sir I was thinking it would be like doing
4004720	4011920	some Howie Mandel shit putting the glove on his head going I know you're doing a bit but
4012480	4019360	I actually considered that my job I was like in the sequence where he's like you're a very strange
4019360	4025040	doctor strange from Austin like comb in and he's like hey what am I doing what am I doing why are
4025040	4028800	you from Austin I don't know and they were like you know do some I thought I was in there because
4028880	4033040	I was like the Rick and Morty guy like it's Dr. Strange you are anyways
4035920	4042240	doesn't matter now god god you would never have to know so you were like saying he comes in wearing
4042240	4047040	green pants and a orange t-shirt come on all right can we not get sidetracked by this
4047920	4055040	I with two big foam hands but you say number one on it you said you heard a crash hello
4055040	4063680	oh you said you heard a crash strange he ain't in I was like look one of these days this guy's
4063680	4067040	going to meet Tony Stark how are we going to know the difference between them the answer has to be
4067040	4076080	that they have different motivations strangeness all right so the weird sideburns Dr. Strange has the
4076080	4087840	cape so you said you heard of you heard a crash heard a crash and then you hear a guy going oh my
4087840	4092960	god you're in my life and I'm thinking oh my god can you imagine like all the permutations about
4092960	4096800	like if you were a ballerina and like like like your ankles are sprained or whatever it's like
4096800	4102240	the slightest like physical thing like somebody or like an actor even clearly he was a beautiful
4102240	4108720	people like one of your face gets sliced by your your your thing or your nose gets broken and it
4108720	4113120	was like oh god I wonder what that was but then the guy was out there for three hours and he was
4113120	4117520	out there so long yelling about how his life was ruined that it became very clear that his life
4117520	4123680	was not ruined because he had the ability to stand outside and yell about his life was ruined and he
4123680	4130320	went into great detail but it was really focused on his car and he's like I can't make money if I
4130320	4136480	don't have my car if my car can't make money I can't make payments on my car so it's like over
4136480	4142480	time you're like this doesn't it sounds like you're doing pretty good like I don't think you were on
4142480	4147920	your way to like a Forbes meeting the poor lady that was being yelled at by this man who already
4147920	4154000	felt bad you know is being yelled at being yelled at being yelled at being yelled at the tow truck
4154000	4162000	picks up her car first and leaves the guy and he's like goodbye thanks for ruining my life
4163840	4170880	I don't have anybody to pick me up I don't have any friends well at least he has an audience
4170880	4178000	I wonder why which is his worst nightmare I mean I'm sure the guy was having a bad day
4178000	4183360	I'm sure it wasn't his fault I'd love to see like that guy the rest of that guy's life he might just
4183360	4189680	be like hold on hey guys I just am getting a new car it's so exciting it's gonna be great I'm gonna

4387280	4389280	I

4409280	4415280	phone at some point like yeah I mean he was saying it for a long time yeah and then I mean
4415280	4419120	I mean and the guy's the video he's hopping around like that's the thing he's like it's okay
4419120	4424080	it's okay to make fun of his tragedy not because he deserves to have misfortune but because he's
4424080	4431040	fine physically like in all the ways that his mishap could hurt him permanently he's fine and
4431040	4439280	he's I just he's jumping up and down yelling my life is ruined I I I I ran out of steam
4439920	4446640	pretty quickly you know this like like I'm like if I show up in a public place I'm like
4448000	4454560	okay yeah I'm done all right goodbye lift goodbye you'll never see me again so but this guy for
4454560	4460560	three hours screaming at the top of the zone I get I get I get him the commitment I was
4460560	4468320	jealous I could be I was that guy I'm this guy but no but but he just he does I'm not I get
4469040	4475120	tired I know I don't I mean I I could be I would I would have been this guy I I have doubled down
4475120	4480400	like I I I don't think you're that guy I had never seen you like when I was 30 years old and
4480400	4486480	shit would befall me I was like are you fucking kidding me and I would like you could wind me up
4486480	4492000	and I would be in the Glendale Galleria like making a like like I would just like I would have
4492000	4497280	this thing like when were you ever like that well you would you would never see it except like once
4497280	4502480	in a while I was like but if a telemarketer called me I go I go like why is my phone ringing I would
4502480	4507120	like enter the exchange like like like why is this happening to me like I was Christ you know
4507120	4512400	like like what what's what's what's with this ripple in my perfect world that my father created
4513280	4521360	hello uh mr. Harmon this is a courtesy call entirely they want to uh who are you and why are
4521360	4525440	you calling me you know it's just like you just get this righteousness about you like I don't know
4525440	4530960	when I was like 30 I was like are you like like well still yeah I'm not I don't mean to imply that
4530960	4536640	I'm mellow and zen now but like I just got I just got filled with enough fat that I was like I'm
4536640	4542480	tired like this piggy needs to roll over and die I think being in the arts when you're super
4542480	4547120	creative and you have some language and you know how to fucking act a little bit you are the worst
4547120	4551840	person a little bit you're the worst person to run into when it comes to shit like that but I do
4551840	4556480	yeah I do think I think outrage is hell like I actually don't I don't want to see less people
4556480	4562960	be so fucking like unfamiliar with with bullshit that they're outraged I don't like we talk about
4562960	4568800	outrage culture and like we want to like dissolve it like a wart with nitrous uh or what is it shit
4568800	4573920	that they would burn your warts away with liquid nitrogen liquid nitrogen um I don't think that's
4573920	4579200	acid I think outrage is great I I think it's amazing for somebody to wake up one morning and
4579200	4585360	be like you know what I I haven't been treated like a human being today I let alone the princess
4585360	4591360	or the prince that I am or or the fucking king or the like like like and end up like enter every
4591360	4596560	exchange that you have with an expectation that that is like fucking like because what's
4596560	4602080	the alternative to that to like take your cues from from a society that thinks you're a piece of
4602080	4607840	shit like how you should be treated some people have to invert that shit and sometimes that that
4607840	4611760	takes the form of a tantrum you know like some people will be like you know what I woke up this
4611760	4615680	morning and I'm like why am I not being treated like a fucking human being
4616240	4617360	talk your fucking keys
4620000	4628320	do you mean like that I can't unlock every door that I walk towards but sort of like that situation
4628320	4632800	where you just you pop off and I think that's a that's a fact I know I think that guy just had to
4632800	4638560	take a giant shit I don't know I'm trying to run that well what what could have made that guy mad
4639360	4643680	that that's literally I was literally advocating for specifically him if he was leaving because he
4643680	4650720	was mad no I think it's okay to get mad fuck this I think it's okay to pop off now and then
4650720	4657280	and be a fucking poser uh fucking crazy hypocritical fucking punk rock activist well fuck you
4658960	4664000	uh there is something about living and when you live in Los Angeles people tend to get out of
4664000	4670480	their cars and rant at you more than other cities and it is the heat well it could be also though
4670560	4676880	remember Los Angeles is like a beautiful city to to walk into traffic in like Los Angeles is very
4676880	4682000	kind to the fucking pedestrian you you step into the street coming out of JFK and like you get a
4682000	4687360	very harsh reminder of like oh shit it's legal to kill me here like like they're aiming for me
4687360	4693120	and that makes New York run but LA like like like like everyone's coming from different countries
4693120	4697200	and all this shit but you we somehow get it pounded into us that if somebody steps into
4697200	4702400	the street even if they're drunk and wandering in like you're it's on you if you hit them yeah so
4702400	4708160	that could be that could create tension for a almost New York sized city where like everyone's
4708160	4712400	got to get somewhere and it's like fuck you know everything's on me if I make a mistake
4712400	4717440	like that could create like fucking you know I don't know it could ruin your life
4720160	4723760	you know in your life that's the other thing I think it was like if a guy is screaming you
4723760	4727920	this ruined my life as a car accident ruin your life the first thing I'm thinking if I'm
4727920	4734400	overhearing that is uninsured lately like which right which he has my support because it's like
4734400	4739440	why like I would be screaming on the sidewalk like why the fuck is it mandatory for me to have a
4739440	4745120	fuck like if somebody hit me and I was uninsured for a week because I was between jobs and all
4745120	4749920	that shit that would fucking send me over I think I think the dude was just being real big
4750640	4755520	honestly because I think if you're fucked you're really quiet when when shit pops off that makes
4755520	4760240	your life really in but also if it was super his fault I think he'd be like like I think it's like
4760240	4764800	look it could be it could be the other driver's fault don't you think that would send him over
4764800	4771760	like more because he's like I did nothing wrong but I was like I'm gonna go to the gap and like I
4771760	4778000	like I like like they told me they told me don't I they told me you can't drive uninsured and all
4778000	4782960	this shit like he took he took his little canoe out into the canal I was like I'm gonna catch
4782960	4788400	some fish I'm gonna come back with them I'm gonna make my village proud I'm like I'm I'm
4788400	4792880	and for that to be taken away from him because somebody like went and it was their fault
4793520	4800320	technically it's his fault it wasn't it but the woman ran into him he he got sandwiched between
4800960	4806560	two cars so then so then he got the worst of so then I understand the outrage I don't I don't
4806640	4811760	I don't like I just get it like I just like like if you're people kept yelling at him going
4811760	4819520	insurance she's got insurance right insurance and he's like you can't get insurance unless you
4819520	4824880	sell enough pizzas and I can't sell pizzas unless people like me and no one likes me because I don't
4824880	4834320	have a car and I understand that I do and I will vote for him when he runs for I because he's I
4834320	4842320	I don't know if that anger goes somewhere I I get it yeah it went into my ears well I'm trying to
4842320	4850320	reply to my emails and I'm hearing this yeah outside it was distracting but that's I had to
4850320	4854400	make fun of it that's what we're talking about homo sapiens versus neanderthals neanderthals
4854400	4861440	would be like wait someone's someone's life is ruined did you say homeless sapiens homo sapiens
4862320	4869440	homo neanderthals uh homo sapiens are the only species capable of going oh there's a guy I
4869440	4876080	hear a guy screaming my life is ruined uh sounds like a job for the mythical thing I've constructed
4876080	4882960	in my head called the DMV the state of california the the rule of law the responsibility barack
4882960	4888800	obama I don't know whatever univision I don't know like you you you you have all these constructs
4888800	4892160	in your head and you're like I would do more harm than good if I even go to the window and
4892160	4898240	look out of it but if you're if you were in a tribe of 150 people and you were like you heard
4898240	4903440	one of your best friends going my life is ruined you'd be like well it's the shitty part of me
4903440	4910560	that's gonna sleep in but but we we're capable of creating cultures where we're like it's actually
4910560	4916400	a pretty good job today heard a guy screaming uh my life is ruined didn't run to the window to
4916400	4921600	take a picture I'm doing pretty good today like like like we kind of pat ourselves on the back
4921600	4926240	for a little bit of numbness because that's how you get through oh a plane goes down with 300 of
4926240	4933360	your of your fellow species and you don't I don't know are you on my side or not are you nothing
4933360	4939600	happened to you what what I'm on your side nothing happened to you I'm just you're saying well 300
4939600	4944480	people died in a playground and you're taking pictures of this no no no he just did an Elizabeth
4944480	4950160	smart version of you I think it's good that you know I'm so they're so happy that guy would be so
4950160	4955040	happy if you could put him in a chamber that sucked all of his misfortune out and then you told him
4955920	4963680	someone recorded you screaming my life is ruined goodbye and 150 people well still some 120
4965040	4973440	all right guys uh uh I get it it's downtown it's monday whatever but uh the the the like
4973440	4977760	you know if you could separate his consciousness he would go like oh that's cool that like my my
4977760	4983120	tragedy like made these people happy for a second because they weren't like what an animal he should
4983120	4991440	be stuck with a spear until he dies although I do again I will say maybe that dude deserved it I was
4991440	4995360	oh that's another huge thing that the sapiens guy talks about that's why everybody needs to read
4995360	5000880	this book but people he talks about gossip here's the thing is like this woman who it was her fault
5000880	5006640	she even said it's my fault it's my fault right my fault was sitting there she was like being
5006640	5013120	screamed at by this guy everybody in the neighborhood was huddled around her like like are you okay do
5013120	5022320	you know like this guy was going nobody's caring about me and like he probably had a neck injury
5022320	5029040	he got hit really hard or a trigger it might have triggered some loss for that dude obviously yeah
5029040	5035840	because he really well it sounds like it ruined his life if we could take him at his word yeah
5035840	5042320	people kept saying calm down and people kept avoiding him because he just was right he was at
5042320	5048720	at a ten and stayed there and which always makes you feel great yeah every primary does that at
5048720	5055040	no point he went I at one point you know I I heard him like talking quietly and I went oh okay well
5055040	5062400	this is the part where he goes okay blew up to there I'm really sorry but you know I just
5062400	5066800	whatever if we could exchange our insurance information I think you know like I think but
5066800	5072480	no he was like going just say you're sorry just say you're sorry just say you're sorry you ruined
5072480	5078880	my life he was just saying it quieter yeah he was just getting like enough energy back to scream at
5078960	5085600	her as he was driving home to her family and home and warm but that doesn't yeah now I mean I not
5085600	5092000	that I was on his side but I mean just say you're sorry like it's like well screaming like I did
5092000	5099520	there's no it's like what does sorry mean to you uh yeah I uh yeah I mean whatever he's 20
5100880	5105440	like yeah I think he's so lucky he's not decapitated that's all I can yeah I think you were like
5105520	5111840	saying when you when you really are fucked you just sit there going shit you know I mean you
5111840	5116720	don't like a fender bender and you're like you don't know what the fuck is like like what do you
5116720	5122800	do like no one tells you they tell you in like driver's ed class and whatever but like come on
5122800	5128080	like like you even it's just a slight tap in Milwaukee like the the roads are icy for nine
5128080	5133440	months of the year and it's like through no fault of your own you just like you just you tap someone's
5133440	5139120	bumper and it's really up to both of you collectively whether or not all of a sudden
5140320	5146320	pull over and exchange the information you just feel like such a like no one leaves their house
5146320	5152080	prepared for that it's great like and here's the thing there was a third person involved
5152080	5157440	with this accident so everybody was huddled around the woman who did was it was her fault
5157440	5163600	everybody was avoiding like the plague the guy screaming up and down and here's this guy that's
5163600	5174160	just kind of okay so that's the third guy yeah he's just like that's why all right that's homo
5174160	5183040	habilis yeah it's like i'm over here too all right uh i guess uh squeaky we all get that's
5183040	5186640	everybody in this audience that's all of us right yeah oh yeah that would have been me going
5187600	5193680	okay well if you if you tell me i'm a bad person i'll be happy to be ashamed of myself uh
5194720	5198720	i'll take my cues from you i didn't get out of bed to not fuck around with society
5200240	5204400	at the same time i will draw a line we don't know where it is but i will draw it
5204400	5213360	i got 12 people that'll pick me up right now but i don't know it's like what am i supposed to do
5215200	5221040	yeah well prayers out to every single person in that accident sounds like everybody got away
5221680	5228800	i like like like god damn like he that expression of like like it could be worse like it always
5228800	5233440	feels like a terrible thing to take solace in like like if you're in a bad situation
5233440	5240240	silver linings did not help you you know well at least you you didn't lose a foot fuck off but
5240240	5246720	i gotta say i gotta say elizabeth smart fucking like she sold me on the uh it could be worse
5247440	5250480	philosophy give me a give me a for instance
5252000	5259680	ruling my show she elizabeth smart like broke it down to game theory about it could be worse
5259680	5264880	because she was like look i'll tell you what i got you know look i don't want to use harsh language
5264880	5269600	and like because it'll sound like i'm making light because like whatever but this girl was
5269600	5275440	through the worst year of uh 14 year old girl's life the the aside from getting murdered afterward
5275440	5280880	you could ever be through and and she and so she recaps it she has this like sort of bon vivant
5280880	5286720	style like like kind of like like she she checks it off like like she's like she's like this is
5286800	5289840	what happened to me this is what happened to me this is what happened and you know what
5289840	5295600	every single time uh something bad started happening to me i kept thinking well it can
5295600	5300720	never get any worse than this and every time i thought that it kept getting fucking worse
5301840	5307760	and so i started to learn after a while it can get worse than this and that's when it started to get
5307760	5313920	better and i was like all right i got like that's like like she was like i hacked the spiritual
5313920	5321200	system she was like well i oh i've gotten to a place where i it's sort of but the other half of
5321200	5325920	you goes yeah but that's how we're all conditioned by things like organized religion to suffer
5325920	5330720	abuse you know like like that's it's a very fascinating it's also a bit of a survival
5330720	5335920	skill though i won't trash it too much it's not conditioning it literally is a thing that keeps us
5335920	5340160	that's and it makes us different like the homo sapiens like we're able to believe in the shit
5340160	5346560	that doesn't isn't real but the important asterisk on that is that real doesn't matter
5346560	5355200	because once you get like the species we make the unreal real so the corporations they're just real
5355200	5361040	like if disney's a corporation like and everyone believes that disney's a corporation which it is
5361040	5367360	even though that doesn't mean anything walt disney isn't alive there isn't anything like disney's
5367360	5373280	just a belief it it exists of like a bunch of like it's like a tribe scriptures that you have
5373280	5380160	a on record and things but ultimately like hey well you know it's like several thousand people
5380160	5385920	like like oh i i got fired today i don't know why it's like it because this belief in the system
5385920	5391200	like the belief matters the belief in the dollar the belief in your taxes the belief that you are
5391200	5398000	a citizen of a country like it like it's it's it's it's almost an understatement to say that
5398000	5403360	oh so much of our life is based on these like fabrications that have nothing to do with reality
5403360	5407360	because that would be the most when you really think about it's like well what did you do today
5407360	5413200	what governed your life today that had anything to do with uh biological reality you took a shit
5413920	5421280	you sneezed i like like everything that had anything that you that you culturally like
5421280	5427200	registered anything that would actually meant anything to you your self-esteem like like like
5427200	5431520	most importantly like whether or not you think you're a good person like it all had to do with
5431520	5438960	like fucking crazy like like shit that doesn't it doesn't exist but it does exist that's the it's
5438960	5442960	not that i don't think the important thing is for us to realize it doesn't exist because i think
5442960	5447520	that's what a raccoon would do that's why a raccoon keeps going through your garbage no matter how
5447520	5452240	many times you tell it it's against the law and the raccoon will just look at you and go that
5452240	5457600	doesn't mean anything that doesn't make the raccoon a hero or a villain it just like makes it means
5457600	5464000	the raccoon makes it a raccoon but the truth for that raccoon is that if it doesn't stop fucking
5464000	5469200	with the wrong person's garbage it's going to die because of a belief system that that human has
5469200	5475040	like decided on like okay it's okay for me to poison you because uh the city of uh whatever
5475040	5489360	i live in doesn't care and it's nevada if it nevada's fine it's is jeff what went on with you
5489360	5495920	and jeff backstage now tell us now reward us for our patience what went on back there what was your
5495920	5506560	strategy because ours won i don't think so we were having a ball well i think we had a pretty
5506560	5520400	good time too didn't we kids i love i love like the people i didn't see clap i'm sorry dad
5520400	5529200	mom picked me up on tuesday and got ice cream so that's fine i love them too i don't demand
5529200	5533200	fealty that's right that's what makes me different from your fake gods
5538320	5542080	i'm the first god to say to you you know what i'd like to earn it
5543760	5549840	that's your first and last commandment let me earn it stop it stop it what you're afraid i'm
5549840	5559680	going to become a cult leader now it's a little late for that concern it's just so what tedious
5563280	5571120	it's like walking uphill that's what that's what kate said to me one time like i would
5571120	5575680	because i do bits you know when we're driving in the car you remember those yeah
5576480	5582640	shrub carpet yeah it's not necessarily like it's like me testing out material usually it's me
5583360	5589360	singing the names of the signs that i you know it's like 25 miles an hour
5591200	5596720	shop code yeah you know like stuff like that you know like uh yeah at one point like it was like
5596720	5602080	silent for a while and then kate goes uh you know it's like talking to you is like walking uphill
5602480	5611360	and i was like and i started like almost crying and she just started laughing the
5611360	5617120	ass off and i'm like that's not funny and then i started laughing because it was pretty funny
5618320	5624160	and then but it was funny because it hurt my feelings i did i didn't like like that's like
5624160	5628880	a vitamin in small doses like it's not a representation of your union but like also
5628880	5635760	that's like your best partner will i i i had a girlfriend once who said i just i i was almost
5635760	5640960	so proud of this in there was an insult like we're because we're sitting at an airport gate
5640960	5647120	and i was like i said i was like i was i was joking i like because i paid for first class
5647120	5655120	tickets and then they were like we're now admitting uh uh people who uh need to sit first and whatever
5655200	5659440	and i was like new to first class and i was like there was a guy literally with a cane
5659440	5666080	that was clearly blind and i said as a joke but you know i lean into my jokes when i'm in private
5666640	5673760	i was like oh great so what do i gotta do to really sit first you know by myself and what did
5673760	5678480	you say i was just i was just making the joke i was it didn't it didn't matter what i said it
5678480	5684240	was like the joke was uh i'm first class but the blind guy gets to get on the plane with his sight
5686480	5692000	what did you pay i am aware of the goddamn iron here i wouldn't have said something if he would
5692000	5699760	have traded but he would my girlfriend go first can i see my baby my girlfriend like
5700720	5704400	you don't know that he got blind doing something cool he could have been an asshole
5705360	5714640	i'm gonna even have poked out an eye uh uh uh uh careful a microscope that that that is uh designed
5714640	5722400	to to make ebola someone's like well he was so enthusiastic about making ebola it's like ow
5723520	5728160	i can't see thank god my point was
5728480	5735520	i you remember these zingers because they're actually like they're like my girlfriend at the
5735520	5743600	time said uh uh you're like a watchdog group for one and i thought i was i thought it was really
5743600	5749200	funny and scathing like it really kind of hurt it was like yeah i really am like like the most
5749200	5756000	ridiculously horrible narcissistic person but it was like also like an expression of like wow it's
5756000	5764720	like like for a partner to be like you are awful it's part of it's part of but at the same time
5764720	5772800	and i think this is the reason i started laughing is because i was it because what kate we because
5772800	5778160	we talked about it for a long time just dissecting why we were both laughing and she said the reason
5778160	5785520	is is you were trying as hard as you can to make it feel like i was walking uphill right
5785600	5791840	listening to this yeah you were trying as hard as you could to be a horrible person yeah we
5791840	5801520	succeeded yeah which is what couples do and yeah but the shortcut to that is like you can be pleasant
5801520	5807120	with each other about everything else if you just take the lid off the fart uh rule just fart with
5807120	5813760	each other and then because then you can be like you're awful because that was awful and then like
5813760	5817520	you can both be like yeah that was bad and then like oh let's get back to our partnership
5817520	5825520	like like in all other matters we're best friends but but don't do that again yeah i won't
5828880	5834320	yeah uh i'm from missouri so you want you you want me to show you a fart no
5836640	5841680	so uh we don't uh we don't really fart in front of one another ever which is i've done i've done
5841680	5847120	both i'm sorry i think i've talked about that before like i i i said sarah i don't think she'd
5847120	5852480	mind me saying this because as i know sarah was going out with jimmy uh sarah silverman going
5852480	5856000	with jerry jimmy kimball who you'd think like okay these two are comedians they're artists
5856000	5859440	or whatever that she i remember we were talking about farting and she was like yeah jimmy and i
5859440	5863040	don't fart around each other and i was like you guys don't fart around each other blah blah blah
5863040	5869040	and and so me and megathy we did a whole marriage was like yeah let's not the only thing i learned
5869040	5873440	from it is that that's a thing you can do that's a total option like it wasn't it didn't make it
5873440	5879280	worse it didn't make it better right but uh but but it's a distinctive decision i think actually
5879280	5886800	what it taught me is when i was when i was a 25 year old kid like who was like oh i associated
5886800	5892080	like farting in front of each other as like with like a threshold of intimacy yeah that actually
5892080	5897280	had to do with abuse well that award that word is too heavy but but like like like that it was
5897280	5903120	like oh you're family now which means you're like like i don't respect you now we're not we're not
5903120	5907920	we're not you know like it's like it's like when the farting becomes when it signifies like well
5907920	5914160	you don't matter to me you know like that's what you don't want to enter your head isn't the problem
5914160	5920880	kind of making farts symbolic in any sense for the relationship that could be because when it means
5920880	5924640	something isn't that the like whether you're doing it in front of each other or not doing
5924640	5931440	but making it mean something that seems like well what are what are we doing i think you may
5931440	5936480	be the most right and most wrong right about this because it is yeah you're right like first of all
5936480	5942480	good luck making farts not mean something not mean the wrong thing like well well just like because
5942480	5946720	because you know getting to that place where it's just well farts are just when air is expelled
5946720	5952960	from your anus like come on good luck they're hilarious and but at any given time it's like
5952960	5958160	it could be like if someone's saying they love you and then you fart like the timing means you
5958160	5962560	don't love them or whatever or or if they're farting more than you because they're lactose
5962560	5968400	intolerant i don't want to open that door that all sounds like madness right so so but no i do
5968400	5973440	think but i do think i do think you're right in that if you maintain the idea that well farts
5973440	5980960	happen so they don't have power over us so if i do fart next to you it doesn't it can't possibly
5980960	5985360	mean by itself that i don't love you it's certainly not supposed to that's not the point
5985360	5990240	of doing that any more than exhaling or or lightning striking because really it's just
5990240	5997200	may as well be weather yeah but the big i think when i was younger i think growing up blue collar
5997200	6003760	and kind of midwestern and like i like just sort of cultural things it's like i think i had it in
6003760	6009040	my relationships like if you're if you're listening to this and i doubt you are and you dated me when
6009120	6013280	i was 19 i don't think you're listening to this podcast but let's go ahead and bring katie out
6014720	6019840	but i think it was like oh yeah i was like yeah like those flowers and candy and then we started
6019840	6024640	farting in front of each other and then it turned into like kind of trailer park like whoa we're
6024640	6029280	what we're balling chaining each other you know what i mean yeah like like but that has nothing
6029280	6034000	to do with the fart it has to do with the symbolism that you project right which is that's probably
6034000	6039280	the real problem yeah well it's your cody and i fart all over each other constantly
6040080	6048320	i'm saving one up for her right now because it means i love you that your dad kept a big
6049760	6058160	barrel of pretzels next next to his recliner do you remember yeah yeah he would have like a big
6058160	6066640	costco's big thing of pretzels were all dried out nasty next to his recliner yeah remember that
6066640	6072080	yeah try to stop eating them though right i would eat them yeah and you'd eat more and
6072080	6076960	they would just dry ass giant brick pretzel and then i know you keep eating them you would eat
6076960	6081680	them i would eat them i'm assuming your dad would eat them and they were it was always full it was
6082160	6088160	because he would get another barrel yeah yeah yeah and i think one time i went out into the garage
6088720	6094640	where where there was the jukebox or whatever that he had or whatever and there were all these
6094640	6104720	barrels of pretzels your dad liked big fucking pretzels they were big ones they weren't little
6105360	6112320	giant pretzels barrels of like quit making me love my dad bro pretzels he got it he gets it
6112320	6119120	he fucking nailed it he had the recliner the remote control and the pretzels in arms reach
6119840	6127200	and backup pretzels in the chamber next to the jukebox because he probably noticed he probably
6127200	6131520	like one day he came home and he's like who ate my pretzels what are we doing and then he was like
6131520	6137360	wait i have money get a billion pretzels if you love pretzels that much get a billion pretzels like

6664560	6673120	scary tale comes to us from a neighbor who thinks maybe when you're planting in your garden
6673120	6682400	you want to be careful for as our next narrator says the carrots in the soul and then some music
6682400	6686720	will come in but then he'll affect some like he's always talking about who needs more narrators and
6686720	6692480	he's always apologizing we could use some more narrators but i'll do this next one anyway
6693120	6699680	and then and then he'll do like here i've been planting carrots for a long time you just get
6699680	6704400	the sense of like come on you're a pig and shit stop you don't need anybody just fucking do it
6704400	6709920	baby fucking i want to hear all your accents he's like sometimes he doesn't like i'm from chicago
6709920	6718400	and i like that one time people told me to watch a channel six making people jump off a building
6718880	6727920	oh that was a scary one uh this next one's about a pussy of fire okay anyways what was
6728560	6734800	yeah i know that confused me too i tell you why would the next one be able to pussy a fire
6734800	6740400	but the answer is because it's time to end the show it's oh and he says at the end he's like
6740400	6745840	oh that's that's the end of our episode like you don't have to tell people that i mean they
6745840	6749920	it's ending he starts it with so much business
6751920	6756320	oh the subscription plan has changed and it's like it's like getting on a bus
6758160	6763040	it's like and a lot of the stories are canadian too and they're so charming they're like oh this
6763040	6768960	next one they got oh what went down by the lake and what went down by the lake is a dude lit up
6768960	6775680	a joint sat on a bench and he saw something scary and he never forgot it that's fucking it like
6776320	6783840	yeah you mean privilege like oh he'll never forget the day by the pine tree lake
6785840	6792160	oh it's a splash and a ghost was splashed and it wasn't a raccoon oh boy the cops came over and
6792160	6797840	they gave me a wag of the finger they sniffed my joint underneath the park bench said you know
6798400	6804880	a lot of people wouldn't believe your story but it ain't my job to judge you
6805680	6810720	and he walked away but i'll never forget that spooky bench by the lake
6815440	6819920	but then they're interspersed with totally american just like i got raped on the dark web
6819920	6823920	because i clicked on the wrong thing and fucking rabbits came in the window and raped my fucking
6823920	6829360	rape flesh yeah but they're red from the same point like oh and the rape and the rape flesh
6830640	6837680	well that brings us to the end of our stories it's a glory the podcasting is the last
6838320	6845200	section of the internet to have any fucking health to it i am out of the rest of it all right what
6845200	6851200	else do we have to do let's just sign off and uh see people next week i just can i please just
6851200	6857360	because people think i'm kidding but i just gotta well uh yeah well uh because i feel like
6857360	6861680	okay just let me well talk about something brandon do you want to have children talk about that for
6861680	6868000	a second i do want to have children why don't you yet what's wrong i'm sure that i do somewhere
6871680	6877120	i have every time i i tape a tv show i'm like are you sure this is going to be on tv because
6877120	6884240	my children will find me um i i uh i don't have children because i date interracially
6885120	6889440	what i just i don't want to do that to a white person's family
6893600	6901440	a little bit of miscegeny can be a fine time for an upstanding citizen but our next story tells
6901520	6911280	the cautionary tale of when race mixing goes wrong join narrator brandon johnson for the story of how
6912080	6914720	i fucked an indian girl
6919440	6925920	oh sorry no that's we didn't okay sorry what no is it what no you and children sorry i didn't
6925920	6929760	mean to because i went yeah why don't we just casually talk about me and my lack of children
6929760	6932640	um well because it started with the cats
6936400	6942560	once you get over two you pretty much know it's not going to happen for you there there is that
6942560	6947920	there's there's also poverty there's abject poverty i want to make more poor black people
6947920	6951840	really is the case so i didn't have kids did you find it yet doesn't
6951840	6960720	doesn't having kids seem like an irresponsible move right now like we could like like back in
6960720	6965760	spartos probably a bad move to have a kid just to toss off toss off a cliff you know it's like it
6965760	6971200	feels like that it does feel like that i i would have kids i think that would you know be okay but
6971200	6978880	we'll never know you know so uh way to bring that down yeah sperm doesn't seem to work
6979680	6987120	yeah i don't know internet or it just things like that dan has atnt and atnt seems like it's even
6987120	6993760	worse than verizon in this exact location however in some of their judgments a really judicious
6993760	6999200	company i think that we love the shows that they bought their recent purchase of the entire turner
6999200	7007600	network yes mom mom oh well it's the widest network there are a version two headlines about
7007600	7015600	pedophilia i think are a fantastic decision i will exchange my fucking life and soul for
