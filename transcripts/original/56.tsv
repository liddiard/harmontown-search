0	16820	Hello, everybody. Happy Mother's Day. Welcome to Harman Town. Happy Sunday. Once again,
16820	21100	Harman Town is in session. I'm back. Jeff Davis, your Comptroller. Won't you please
21100	32140	welcome to the stage the Mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman. Thank you. Happy Mother's
32140	40180	Day. No more wire hangers, you guys. We watched Mommy Dearest today and in bed, Erin and I
40180	47900	did. We weren't doing it thematically. We'd been on this Joan Crawford kick and we just happened
47900	52380	to be else and she turned to me. We're watching Mommy Dearest on Mother's Day, but that's a good
52380	57460	one to watch at any day. I think about that movie a lot, mostly because I want her bathroom from
57460	61540	that first scene with all the shower nozzles. I want a lot of that house, yeah. That house is
61540	68940	really good. Watching it made me remember, because that was like when I was a kid and I
68940	73820	remember, you know, America was fascinated with that movie. My mom really liked that movie. She
73820	78420	was into it. She'd quote it a lot. She'd joke like no more wire hangers like when she would
78420	84780	find herself getting hysterical. She'd self-efface by saying stuff like that, but also she would do
84780	91540	so much from the movie and I was like, did she get the idea from the movie or was she, or did the
91540	97180	movie make her feel better by, you know, it's like, oh, I didn't use a whole can of comic cleanser. I
98140	104980	just wanted to clean the bathroom a little bit. I don't know. Happy Mother's Day. My mom, I called
104980	113180	my mom today, as you all did. Yeah, we did. Or did you? Yeah. Anybody not called their mom? See,
113180	117260	you weren't making the joke that Goldberg was making. He called out, yeah, we did. Called my
117260	124340	mom. Get it? He fucked my mom. Oh, okay. Well, payback is fair, right? Yeah, sure. No, you've
124340	130340	been fucking everyone's mommas for a long time now. Yeah. I called her and I got great news. She
130340	140540	loves season four of community. She's very happy with it. She was quoting episodes. She's got it.
140540	144700	And then I said, yeah, we should come up. We should get together sometime. And she went, yeah,
144700	150940	cool, cool, cool, cool. Oh, sorry. Sorry. And I just laughed about it. I was like, you're sorry
150940	158860	about that? I don't understand. So it registers in your brain that that's an issue socially,
158860	165460	but you just cool, cool, cooled for 10 minutes about the thing. And then I was on speaker phone
165460	171980	because my dad was in the room. So then she did a classic Harmon move. She was like, what? Huh?
171980	178260	What? I don't understand what you're saying. And I was like, never mind. What was your question?
178260	182100	She's like, question. It's not an inquisition. I was like, I'm sorry. What the fuck's going on?
182100	189740	God damn it. Every year. Have you watched season four? Do you watch it? No, no, I haven't. I just,
189740	196220	for selfish reasons and for altruistic reasons and just philosophical reasons, I still haven't
196220	201980	watched it. It's on my TiVo. I kept the season pass. So every time we Game of Thrones night,
201980	207020	like tonight, we go there and I see a little folder that says community. And I go, it's like
207020	215980	looking at Instagram, you know, your ex-girlfriend out there. I picked that restaurant. I introduced
215980	229540	her to that restaurant. I, I, I, I sewed that dress. Weird relationship. Uh, uh, so, uh, I was good.
229540	232820	That was going to be part of my segment called things. Dan Harmon's not allowed to complain
232820	238940	about cause they make them sound like a rich douche. Uh, my mom loved season four community. Um,
238940	246140	uh, the other items are, uh, there's a, I have a black widow infestation in my backyard. You're
246140	253460	allowed to complain about that. Not to people who don't have backyards. No, you've let, you've
253460	257580	let them off the hook. Now they don't feel bad about not having a back yard. Guys stay in your
257580	264860	apartments. Backyards have black widows. Erin was in the backyard. She moved a ceramic pot or
264860	271340	rabbit or something. And, uh, uh, and a, a black widow spider, like from the movies crawled across
271340	279020	her hand and she, she killed it and then found like it's egg sack inside the ceramic rabbit. And, uh,
279020	284460	yeah, they're all over our garage too. They're all like all up in our garage. She keeps telling me
284460	288060	these stories about black widows crawling on her. I'm like, what is it? It's like, it's like
288060	293980	Christopher walking in deer hunter. It's like, stop whatever you're doing. Knock it off. Stop
293980	300700	putting your hands under ceramic items. This is building a tree stuff like in flash Gordon, uh,
300700	305100	in our front yard so she could just put scorpions in and reach into it every day. If I have a golf
305100	310780	ball that goes slightly into a bush, I get the longest club in the bag. Unless you live anywhere
310780	319580	with snow on the trees. Yeah. Don't touch a bush. I, I, I, I came to California with that knowledge
319580	324780	just from time life books about spiders. I was, I was a big spider guy when I was a kid. I loved
324780	328540	spiders. I would, I would, I would go out behind the garage in Wisconsin and I would, I would, I
328540	333660	would play with bugs. I loved bugs. I was fascinated with them. I, I probably would have been an
333660	341660	entomologist or something or an arachnidopia. And I would just, I would just play with spiders
341660	347420	and bugs and stuff. So much so that my, my, one of my aunts, uh, for Christmas gave me this big
347420	353580	colorful book, uh, for adults about spiders because there was something I was really into.
353580	359660	And I read the book. There was, it was just a scientific book about the world's most poisonous
359660	365420	spiders. Uh, and, uh, and I remember reading like descriptions of like, I, I think the black
365420	371580	widow, I think it was the black widow. It said something like, uh, uh, yeah, it's a, it's a,
371580	379500	it remains relatively still, but it also has a lot of, but, but it's reflexes are so fast that it
379500	387020	could, it can traverse, uh, the length of a broomstick and a human arm faster than the human, uh,
387020	393020	ability to drop the stick or something like that. Like, like purposely like using, uh, measurements
393020	399260	to terrify you. It will, it will be in your ear eating your brain before you can say there's a
399260	403100	spider in my ear eating my brain. I have, I have a pretty live and let live policy with ant, like
403100	406380	with bugs and stuff like that. I don't like ants. You know, it was a bunch of ants in their place.
406380	411420	So if I see one ant, that's the scout ant. So I do that. I whack that ant. So I make sure that
411420	414700	he doesn't go back and tell the tale about it. You put his head on a microscopic pike,
415660	417420	a little tiny curb and I kick his teeth.
420460	425580	I always leave, I always kill one when there's another one watching. And then I look at the
425580	429500	other one and I say, it doesn't work. Tell your friends. I've tried to tell your friends there.
429500	433340	It doesn't work. They do tell their friends and they go, oh, the breadcrumb is still there.
434140	438060	So now Kevin's dead. So if nothing else, we can eat Kevin
439660	443980	because they're insects or, or we can go, we can go team up on that asshole that killed Kevin.
444540	451020	In their dreams. Spiders know. I told you the story about me falling asleep one time,
451020	456220	when I was 24, I had a girlfriend. I was staying at her place and we were asleep naked. And I woke
456220	460620	up and there was a sound of what I thought was like a moth had gone into my ear. I was laying
460620	468540	on my left side and something that sounded like a one man band was in my brain. And it was, and I
468540	472300	jump up naked. I'm running around the room screaming. She's laughing because it looks
472300	481020	hilarious. But I hear it's that loud and it's freaking out. And I'm trying to like hit my head
481020	485580	and get it out and I'm punching myself in the ear. And she's like, what are you doing? I'm like,
485580	492300	it's a moth. It's a fly or bugs in my ear. And it was so loud and it was nonstop beating on my
492300	497980	like flapping on my eardrum. And I start, I punch myself in the head as hard as I can,
498860	505260	dazing myself and the bug. And then I hear, which I think was his heart.
507500	511580	I just, I just like dazed it and stunned it for a while. And then it starts going again. And every
511580	516540	time I try to, she goes like, she turns a light on, but I have to turn my head up to the light,
516540	521420	which makes the feeling of gravity is going to bring it farther into my brain. And I don't want
521420	525020	to do that. So I'm trying to like, like you try to get water out of your ear. That's not working.
525820	529660	So I've been told later on that way, if that happens, if a bug goes in your ear,
529660	533660	pour alcohol in there, like knock it out, get it drunk, fuck it up. And then at least
533660	537900	the insanity will stop. But I'm just losing my mind and punching myself. And she takes
537900	542060	me tweeters out and tries to get it. And at long last, and it takes a long time. We're both nude
542060	545580	in the, in the bathroom in the middle of the night. And she's like, we'll get you to the hospital.
545580	549900	Like I'll be insane by the time we get to the hospital. I seriously will lose my mind. It was
549900	554620	freaking me out. And the noise was so loud. And now it's, it's, it's scrambling. And I feel
554620	559900	the sensation of it burrowing in. It's going the wrong way. It's not going to go the way though,
559900	567500	the punching. It's like there's a crazy descended from hundreds of generations of spiders that
567500	573260	survived humanity. It's just a crazy giant outside. It's not going to go that way.
573260	577580	Knows exactly when to stay put. So she, she gets my head up this way into the light. So the air
577580	584220	is pointing up and she puts a tweezers down my ear and manages to get halfway into my brain and
584220	595500	pulls out a spider the size of a nickel and worth every penny. It's been our show. Good night,
595500	602860	everybody. And, and it flies out and we both scream because it's quite alive and it's pretty,
602860	608140	it's pretty scary looking and it hits the ground running. And so I barefoot just go wham and stamp
608140	615260	on it with a size 13 and a half barefoot foot. And I lift up my foot and it goes, it just shrugs
615260	625980	it off. There are days and there are days. I can't get a break around here. Like I want,
625980	633500	like I wanted to be in your ear. It looked like a barn. So it just fell down my ear. And you know,
633500	637820	they say that we eat, we eat lots of bugs in our sleep and don't know it. But I finally managed to
637820	641660	kill it. And then for the rest of the time we did it, which wasn't long, she kept putting fake
641660	650620	spiders in the bed. What? Yeah, just to be, I believe the word is asshole. And it's the worst.
650620	654860	So now like I used to sleep with like a pillow on my head and stuff. It's terrible.
656140	663660	All right. So now sleep tight, everybody. All right. My mom loves season four.
666060	669180	We're infested with black widows. We're going to have a guy come take care of it. That's why I
669180	673980	sound like an asshole because you guys couldn't have a guy come take care of it. I'm going to
673980	677660	call the black widow guy. I don't know who he is. Harvey Keitel is going to pull up in a Ferrari.
681020	685020	And you know, my animated show is going to take till December for you guys to get to see. I'm
685020	691260	very excited. That's another thing I'm complaining about. People keep spreading rumors about me
691260	698300	going back to season five of community. I'm complaining about that. And that navigation
698300	703820	system in my Prius, I keep dropping blue flags everywhere. That's the worst. You know what I'm
703820	709900	talking about. Yeah. Five percent of the audience going, who's got this goddamn navigation system?
709900	714060	Fucking blue flags and keep dropping blue flags. Anybody with a Toyota or Alexis, I think.
715180	720540	Every intersection, you can fucking drop a blue flag at random, random spots. I got blue flags
720540	725500	all over the city. There's a menu you can delete. I know, but you're never going to do that, are you?
725500	730620	I do. You're always on your way somewhere and you're dropping these blue turds all over. Precisely
730620	734460	when you're trying to do the opposite, which is figure out where you're going and you're putting
734460	739580	flags all over the thing and then you come out. Okay, I'm going to go home from work now.
740700	744700	Are you sure you don't want to go to one of these blue flags? You like so much? Go to Ivar. You
744700	753900	loved it. You put a blue flag there. No, Nicole. I call my car Nicole. I'm not going, I probably,
753900	759020	I'm just saying, Nicole Kidman thing? Is that my? Yeah, probably. I don't know. I don't name my car.
759100	767180	I have better things to do. I can't even name characters I create. The community has all my
767180	774780	friend's names. So that rumor on a deadline, I think the reason for it is because weeks ago,
774780	782060	Sony reached out through private channels, not that they would have ever reached out through
782060	789980	honest public ones. They were the way that big studios work is that they're in the business of
789980	794860	getting their shows syndicated. And I think that in the days before they were sure that
795820	801100	community would get that very important next 13 episodes, which to them, that's all it represents
801100	807500	is just the number 13. They don't care if any of those 13 are good or bad. They just needed those
807500	813660	13 so that they could not get fired by the machines that make the money from the 97 episodes.
815500	820060	It'll be very lucrative for me as well. We're all very happy. Everyone except the people that never
820060	826380	made any money and who got tattoos of Abbott on their thigh. We're all thrilled to pieces about
826380	832380	this episode. But back before it happened, when they were in the position of going, what can we
832380	837740	do to make sure this happens? They in their misguided bottom line minds were thinking,
837740	842460	well, let's sweeten the kitty. Like maybe we could tell NBC, Dan will come back and that way there
842460	846780	will be all kinds of press. And that's how little they care. That's how little shame they have. They
846780	854860	don't care. Like to them, that wouldn't be winning or losing. They don't care. And I think that in
854860	859020	the ensuing weeks during which time NBC finally made a decision to pick up the show, so it doesn't
859020	865580	matter. Someone's assistant probably told someone's assistant to someone's friend over drinks
865580	871980	that that conversation happened for a second and resulted in maybe a deadline article,
871980	875580	which resulted in a bunch of other press about it. So you're going back?
877260	883500	Tuesday. No, my point is I don't think it's a question that I would even have a yes or no
883500	888620	answer to. I don't think that that is a choice that I have. I haven't read this article for
888620	893180	all. I know you're perpetuating this myth right now. I probably am. I'm trying to make
893180	897740	Harmontown a thing you should come to and listen to, I guess. I don't know. I'm participating.
897740	904460	Where's my clicks? Wait, but Chevy's not in the show anymore. We got to get him here. Well,
905980	914060	why? Because it'll be insane. Why not bring Chevy Chase once to Harmontown? Did you see
914060	919340	him on SNL? No. Do you understand what happens when he walks into a room? Everything gets
919340	924860	complicated. I'm not saying it's going to be fun. I'm saying that we all muscle up. It's like
926380	933900	going to play paintball. It hurts. It's sweaty. You get bruised. I just don't see it the way you
933900	941500	see it. I call him. He calls me sometimes. The concept is funny on paper.
945020	949100	Can we skype him? Can we get a screen up and do a little via satellite thing?
950380	951660	Yeah, he seems pretty tech savvy.
955340	962140	He's probably skyping me right now. I can't figure out how to filter it right. He can.
962140	971180	He does a lot of PHP programming in his spare time. I just wanted to address that because
971180	976300	people tweet me and I thought maybe that would be fun. Worth your $10 alone to come out and hear
976300	982620	me say out loud. All right, so I think that ends the I had stuff to talk about segment.
982620	987020	I saw an Arrested Development poster outside Meltdown. I got really excited. It was cool.
992700	996700	Might be a little cameo in one of those episodes by a certain fat alcoholic.
997100	1003820	Close to your hearts. May or may not have gone out and visited that set.
1005340	1011660	I also had to edit out the whole for anyone that was here when I when I described me being on the
1011660	1020220	set of a Terrence Malick movie with with what's his name Batman in it. Christian Bale. Did you
1020220	1024860	know John Landis is the new Batman? Did you know that? I was I was very surprised. It's weird,
1024860	1030780	but they're guys are going back to a kind of like classic feel. I was I was I was I told the story
1030780	1034140	about going and being on the set of a Terrence Malick movie with Christian Bale and then I had
1034140	1038380	to edit the whole thing out for the very specific reason that as Aaron pointed out to me on the way
1038380	1044860	home. I got to there's it's okay for me to say that I got to do that and how cool it was. It's
1044860	1052380	not okay for me to reveal absolutely anything about the film itself, which I did in the process of
1052380	1057980	talking about the movie. So I lifted the whole thing out. But that and the only thing that that
1057980	1062220	I the only thing that's left is that I get to say I did this thing. Who cares? It's like hearing
1062220	1067180	someone talk about a slot machine in Vegas. It's amazing. I was up and then it was down. Who the
1067180	1074380	fuck yourself? Who cares? Or like when people tell you about their Dungeons and Dragons characters.
1075020	1079020	But he was a level five mage and he had an eye patch and a hawk on his dick.
1079740	1089260	It's make believe. While you were gone, Bill poisoned us. Hello, Bill. I just heard that hilarious.
1089260	1094700	Bill, were you also the guy we were talking about? Where are my cookies? Did those get
1094700	1098940	destroyed in the bonfire you had afterwards? I don't know. Maybe they're back. Maybe they're
1098940	1103980	backstage. I would have been the only one that lived had everybody died from the beef jerky.
1103980	1112380	Yeah. Bill, settle a bet. Spencer said you were the benign deviance guy.
1112380	1123900	Yes. Okay. So Bill wasn't a stranger. Wasn't a stranger bearing meat. He was our old friend.
1123900	1127740	Did you call up the supplier? Was that neglect on your part? Did you just leave it out too long?
1128540	1131100	I waited too long because I had to miss a show.
1132860	1140620	He's blaming us now. Oh, you had to miss a show. Okay. Well, we all made it. It was very funny.
1141900	1146140	What was your emotional takeaway from all that? There was kind of a roller coaster of whether
1146140	1152620	or not you were a good person or a bad person. In the moment, I sort of shut down.
1152620	1163100	In the moment, I sort of shut down, but then when I heard everybody applauding in the podcast,
1163100	1167420	when I listened to it later, I finally felt like I could forgive myself because I heard everybody
1167420	1173420	like going, yeah, but I could not hear that. Oh, really? That's interesting. That happens.
1173420	1178460	I think that's a, that's some kind of weird, uh, uh, yeah, when I, when I'm on stage,
1178460	1183420	like I all often are actually less now than another, but it's like, I, I've already, yeah,
1185900	1189980	worrying about other, what other people think like causes a kind of like weird,
1189980	1195020	the same thing as when you're running a marathon and, uh, those drugs fled your body that let you,
1195020	1199100	don't let you know that your muscles are shredded and that you're in pain and stuff. Like, uh,
1199100	1202700	it makes you kind of deaf and insensitive to things. And so you're kind of in your own little
1202700	1208380	bottle in your head, I think that's what happened to him or, or it was the fungus.
1209500	1213580	You may have poisoned yourself. Yeah.
1216220	1220700	After the show, I crawl up on the fire escape to get as close as possible to the sun. And then
1220700	1229180	just as a leaf comes out of my head, uh, that is the worst and yet the coolest fungus of all,
1229180	1233420	the one that makes ants brains go crazy and makes them climb a tree. Yeah. That's nuts.
1233420	1237340	That's the way you got to think about it. The thing that's terrifying about that is,
1237340	1242940	is this that there was a day before that fungus existed. And then there was a day,
1242940	1248940	it was Wednesday of maybe 6,000 BC. We don't know. I mean, but, but, but, but, but that fungus,
1248940	1254460	like, like from the aunt's perspective, like Wednesday was fine. And then Thursday, like,
1255180	1262300	you know, Nathaniel was going like, and then, and then like, because it was, I don't know. I mean,
1262300	1265420	I'm sure there was lots of trial and error in the fungus's part. There was lots of fungus
1265420	1269740	and lots of answers brains, but just get in the brain and fuck them up. And then that fungus
1269740	1275580	didn't survive, but the fungus that specifically got in there and learned that a Voltron, the
1275580	1281020	ant's brain drive him up the tree, like, like, like, like make his legs move. It's really crazy.
1281660	1286220	I don't know, Jeff. I don't, I, I, I think that's too complicated for random mutation. I'm, I'm,
1286220	1291500	I'm converting to intelligent design. Me and Ben Stein are going to go on a retreat.
1292940	1296460	Uh, I've had it. Have you seen the human eyeball? It is complex.
1299100	1309260	I give up. No more science. That human eye. Who would do that? Who, I mean, who wouldn't?
1310220	1314700	What, what random system would do that? That's, that's the intelligent design main argument.
1314700	1320060	Look at the human eye. Ben Stein's into that now? I think he is. I saw a trailer for, yeah.
1321180	1326780	Yeah. I saw a trailer for a documentary that played a lot of like punk rock music or something
1326780	1332220	while he walked around. And I think the implication was that, yeah, he was, he was doing the, uh,
1333100	1343340	uh, religious thing, but, but saying God existed. Who cares? On either, on either side, who cares?
1343340	1346140	How softball was it? The only thing more obnoxious than somebody like beating
1346140	1350060	down doors and insisting God exists. Does somebody do it? Is somebody insisting he doesn't? Like,
1350060	1355980	it's so dumb. Such a dumb argument. Who cares? Yeah. I saw Bill Maher. It's like, believe what
1355980	1359500	you want, but he's just being a dick about it. Like he's saying, like, almost you would say
1359500	1364540	evangelical. Yeah. I just can't stand. And dogmatic and, and being a fundamentalist and
1364540	1372300	being just a tool. Like he's, he's knocking on my door and thumping a book called Not the Bible. And
1373980	1377740	also he just seems like a terrible guy anyway. Yeah. I mean, and if you're gonna, yeah, if you,
1377740	1382620	if you've nailed a way of life, advertise for it with a big smile on your face and hanging out,
1382620	1387020	and then let me go, God damn it. I love that guy. How can I be more like him? Let me sneak
1387020	1392540	into your underwear drawer and find your Bible. And because I need to know how to be as happy as
1392540	1397260	you and walk around scowling. I don't want to know what you, what you put in your drink at night.
1398940	1407660	I got my own problems. The key, the problem is that everybody thinks that everyone's codependent.
1407660	1413900	Everyone insists that only if and when everyone in the world does exactly the same thing while
1413980	1420140	all our problems be solved that. And so people justify simultaneously being completely unhappy
1420140	1425180	and being totally passionate about some point of view, which if everyone just would, you know,
1425180	1431180	you got to attend your own garden. So that way you're not that people could just counter your
1431180	1435420	argument by going, well, then why are you such a miserable sack? And I think that's why people are
1435420	1439180	into politics. It's not, it's not, it's not really because they care that much. It's because it
1439180	1444620	justifies being a miserable and evangelical piece of shit simultaneously without being a hypocrite.
1444620	1450300	I think the appeal of politics is that you can pretend that your point of view is important even
1450300	1455420	though it clearly isn't to you. It's like in the electrical and acid test and Ken Kesey is asked to
1455420	1458940	speak at like, is it Berkeley or whatever? And all the kids are like, you know, like, like, you know,
1458940	1464620	let's change everything, let's change everything. And he's the voice of that, you know, that, that
1464620	1467900	time and that movement they think. And he gets up and he's like, yeah, it just kind of seems like
1467900	1472460	you're all just yelling me, me, me. Like, it's all about just I, it's like, it's all just you
1472460	1476780	just saying your name out loud. And everybody's like, Abby Hoffman gave a big speech in the,
1476780	1481420	at some point in the 60s, you know, when everybody was goofing around, Abby Hoffman did a thing where
1481420	1485420	he got up and like, he just said, he said this whole speech and everybody was cheering for it.
1485420	1489580	And he's like, I can tell you guys love this speech, but I gotta, I feel bad taking credit
1489580	1497020	for it was actually written by Adolf Hitler in 1935. I just gave you a speech from Hitler.
1498620	1502220	Did he change, did he change some words? I'm sure he translated it into English.
1503500	1508620	But I'm sure it was, I mean, but I bet he didn't have to change that much because it was probably
1508620	1514220	just general. I mean, every time Hitler spoke, he didn't say let's kill 6 million Jews. Otherwise,
1514220	1517740	that would, that would be, you know, that, that roulette wheel would have come up double zero at
1517740	1523100	a certain point. So it would be like six minutes. Come on. I'm, I got, I got work tomorrow.
1523180	1530060	Um, most of the time he was saying very similar stuff to every politician you've ever heard in
1530060	1534460	your life, which is we're so fucking amazing. We're going to be amazing from now on. We haven't been
1534460	1537580	amazing in the past, but now we're going to be really amazing tomorrow. And it's going to be
1537580	1543020	because we're strong and we're together and words that mean absolutely nothing in a world where we
1543020	1548860	then team up on specific words, like retarded and the N word and go, okay, let's get rid of these
1548940	1553580	words. Cause these things are like abracadabra. If I say retarded enough in the wrong way,
1553580	1558540	the retarded people are going to, they're going to be even more retarded. Uh, if we eliminate the
1558540	1563740	word retardation will go away. Uh, not that it should because they're amazing people and,
1563740	1571580	and it's language that's this, that's the real handicap. Uh, meanwhile, people who say words that
1571580	1577900	have no meaning at all are actually actively oppressing people and causing things that result
1577900	1583740	in people being physically hurt. Uh, uh, and, and they get away with it because their words are
1583740	1587740	porridge instead of having any flavor. Porridge can be good. That's I'm not saying
1589020	1593260	porridge shouldn't be synonymous with lack of flavor. It gets a bum rap because the famous
1593260	1601420	porridge is from Oliver twist and the classic teddy bear story. Bad porridge is yeah. Bad porridge
1601420	1608060	is a higher profile than good porridge. There's not enough. Uh, so we need to start a, a, a, a,
1608060	1613180	a, an anti-porridge defamation league of some kind that can like, like, like, like, like,
1613180	1617340	what, where, where are the stories where like Jack climbs a bean stock and he finds golden
1617340	1624300	porridge. What qualifies something as porridge? Uh, I think it has to, uh, I don't know. Can
1624300	1628140	someone look that up over here and tell me what, tell me what makes porridge porridge and not just
1628140	1637340	like a nice bowl of cream of wheat or, uh, or grits or something like that. Like the way
1637340	1642140	pudding is just dessert in, in, in, in England, like like putting just means dessert, basically.
1642140	1646460	Well, no, putting is lots of things. It's also like savory things. You can get a pudding in any
1646460	1652620	meal of the day there. So maybe porridge is just like a bowl of hot boiling ground crushed or
1652620	1658780	chopped cereal in water, milk, or both. That's a lot of ores. We have optional flavor.
1659820	1668780	Yeah. So it's great. It's bad cereal. Boiled or, or, or poached, uh, cereal, wheat, grain, or human
1668780	1676300	head, uh, served or not served in a bowl or on a platform for breakfast or to send a message to the
1676300	1685180	enemy or anything in between. Now then what makes gruel gruel? Is gruel just like the world's worst
1685180	1695820	porridge? Yeah. Yeah. So gruel's worse than bad porridge on the, uh, on the Homeland Security
1695820	1701420	porridge color-coded scale. We can formulate the world's most culturally biased SAT question out
1701420	1707980	of this. Porridge is to gruel as gruel is to. Uh, all right. Uh, well, let's, let's, let's, I,
1707980	1713340	I don't have shit to talk about. Uh, let's, let's get the stars on stage. Yeah. Season five in your
1713340	1718380	dreams with me. Uh, uh, they, they, they haven't asked. They won't ask. If you, if you, if they
1718380	1723340	asked you, and let's say they gave you the keys to the kingdom. I am a professional storyteller
1723340	1728780	and that's an amazing third act. So I, yeah, I would definitely, I'm not, I would not be closed
1728780	1732380	to that amazing story. I used to, uh, you bummed out they haven't, I mean, obviously they're not
1732380	1737740	going to ask you, but I, you know, see this is, this is the thing. This is the reason I, I refuse
1737740	1747020	to be bummed out they haven't asked. That's not fair. I, I, I, I get to be happy they haven't asked.
1747020	1751500	That is, that is my luxury. Have you fantasized? That is why when Sony reached out to my agency
1751500	1757100	and said, what down is that? I, my response to my agent was like, when you guys figure out a yes or
1757100	1763660	no question to ask me all together as one collection of suits, I will then have a question
1763660	1768780	to answer. I'll be God damned if I'm going to, I was a nerd in high school. I know how this shit works.
1770540	1775260	I was supposed to go like, yeah, I'd go back and then, and then get an email from Bob Greenback
1775260	1781820	like, I heard you'd said you'd come back, uh, uh, bitch. I don't know who you think you are,
1781820	1788620	but the voice is doing real good. We don't need your ass. And I went, what the fuck did I do?
1788620	1795820	I just got dumped twice. I don't even like you people. I'm happy and forensics. You can take
1795820	1801100	your cafeteria table and stick it up your ass. All you guys do is sit there and talk about how
1801100	1807740	thin you are. I have friends in the drama club, but we're, we're close. We're going to Rocky Horror
1807740	1817100	together. I have a meaningful relationships. I don't care how popular you are. I do a little bit.
1817100	1825660	It was fun. Do you, I mean, obviously you still retain popularity because you are still attached
1825660	1831260	to that, to that show, but do you miss the kind of day to day popularity of like? No, no, no. I miss
1831260	1837500	the day to day, like actual substance instead of the kind of day to day, like talking about,
1837500	1845740	you know, I miss the actual like short term. Let's put on a show every week. How did you feel about
1845740	1851340	that? Here's your reaction. You know, the, the, the, the, the building and building and building
1851340	1857900	of that drum circle of fans. That, that, that beast getting fed and then responding to it with
1857900	1862780	creations of their own. I'm not blowing smoke. Like I, what I miss is the actual content
1862780	1868460	and the creation of it and the response to it and the, and that fire burning. I don't miss
1868460	1874220	the byproduct of it, which was like people talking about me, which inevitably would always result in
1874220	1880700	people saying I was fat or psycho or something like that. So you get ash with that ember. It
1880700	1885020	doesn't matter. But what, what I miss is the fire. What a metaphor. Go fuck yourself.
1885020	1892220	I have another drink, you black widow covered fucking Joan Crawford, eyebrow painting,
1892940	1902300	cream faced, no wire hanger loving. No wire hanger loving. You no wire hanger loving bitch.
1903820	1907100	There was just one black guy in that movie to stand up and really give it to her. You don't
1907100	1912860	hate wire hangers. You love the absence of wire hangers. There's a, there's a, there's so many
1912860	1916540	times in that movie where the daughter pauses outside the house before going back in one more
1916540	1921340	time from one more, you know, convent academy or whatever. And I actually just realized they
1921340	1927020	needed like one black guy in the front row to go, don't go in there. Stop it. She keeps hitting you.
1927020	1932060	I'm almost certain no black person ever saw mommy. Yeah. And if they did, they'd probably be so
1932060	1939980	confused. Yeah. I don't know. Because everyone knows black people are synonymous with an experience
1939980	1945420	in life and set of perceptions. They're completely objectified subset of humanity. We all know that.
1945420	1952060	All right. I'm, I'm being sarcastic. Your silence disturbs me sometimes.
1954700	1960220	I got the message from the survey last week. Half of you think I'm racist and a majority of you are
1960220	1966700	the juries out. So I want to talk a little bit about what I listened to when I was away. So we
1966780	1970460	should probably get Spencer Kumail up here. All right. Can we get Spencer Crittenden
1971500	1973420	and Kumail Nanjiani to the stage?
1977580	1982140	By the way, you know, the headline on deadline tomorrow is going to be Dan Harman expresses
1982140	1991420	strong desire to return. I don't feel sorry for myself for a second at all. Obviously I'm, I'm,
1992220	1998940	I have lots of money and I'm an amazing person. And I'm going to live till 90 and I'm going to
1998940	2005660	die on a bed of money with six dogs licking my nipples. And you know, the whole American dream
2006380	2013180	and a huge tapestry made out of dead black widows. Just little tiny black widow heads,
2013180	2021820	like a big game hunter and little, little mahogany crests with an Australian assistant
2021820	2026300	who really kind of bagged them all for me. I like Roosevelt. Like I go out with a monocle and an
2026300	2031100	elephant gun. See that one there. He could run across a broomstick and cross your arm faster
2031100	2038140	than your career. Not anymore he can. He was about cheater speed. He's like, he's obviously
2038140	2042140	the guy that's really behind all the kills, but I'm like, Oh, that one there. That was an eight
2042140	2048620	legger. I think there were mostly eight leggers. You, you, you'd be the kind of guy who would never
2048620	2054620	be invited back to the, you would, you would end up in a mysterious shooting accident on my yacht.
2054620	2061820	It's going to be all the black widow heads in my head also. Are they super, to bring together two
2061820	2067980	things that you spiders and religion in Islam, at least my sect of Islam, at some point in history,
2067980	2073020	there was a spider and the good guy was hiding from the bad guys and the spider made a web to
2073020	2080060	hide the bad guy. So in my sect of Islam, spiders, you can't kill them. Like, so they're all over
2080060	2084780	the place. Well, we, I mean, I mean, it's not religious in Western society, but it's bad luck
2084780	2089820	to kill a spider. Oh, is that right? Because they eat bugs. It's interesting that it gets like all
2089820	2093420	like turned around like that. So we had like spider webs. You couldn't, you couldn't do anything.
2093420	2097900	I don't think it's bad luck to step on a brown recluse or something like that. I mean,
2097980	2103340	California, I've noticed there's a lot less mention of how much bad luck it is to kill spiders in
2103340	2107420	Wisconsin. Everybody likes the little daddy long legs that chill out and, you know,
2107420	2115740	they're arthropods. Sometimes I don't know how I can get up in the morning.
2117660	2120300	It's not how you get up. It's how can you go to sleep at night?
2122940	2125100	Who do you think is putting all those black widows in your garage?
2125500	2130300	I go to bed at night amongst a nest of very well respected arthropods
2131820	2137100	who like porridge do not deserve the rap they got from spiders. What daddy long legs? Do you know
2137100	2141260	this? They're that urban legend. Everyone thinks that daddy long legs, they say it's the most
2141260	2150300	poisonous beast on earth, but it can't pierce the human skin with. Oh, yes. So you let a daddy
2150300	2154380	long leg crawl in your hand and nothing's ever going to happen. Because it's like the brontosaurus
2154380	2160460	of spider looking things. It's never gonna it's like a ridiculous it maybe would eat like an ant
2160460	2165980	leg if it found one in the mail. Well, you know, if it had the right address on it, if it's if it
2165980	2170780	just said to resident, it would be like, this isn't mine. I can't. Very polite. It's gonna be so
2170780	2176700	frustrating. You know, brontosauruses don't exist. That was that was a hoax. Wait, what worst? Oh,
2176700	2182300	wait, brontosaurus. They have been taken out. They're not real dinosaurs. Same as Pluto. Yeah.
2182380	2189100	Jesus. They got Pluto. Wait, so well, here's the story. It's like Bobby and John Kennedy. Yeah.
2189980	2194860	Because you got the brachiosaurus, right, which is when it looks like it. And then famously sneezes
2194860	2201100	a lot, a lot of snot on kids. Only when it's hilarious. Wait, so tell me. Apparently, there
2201100	2205900	were two paleontologists, I forget the exact this is like the 60s or something who were like fighting
2205900	2210220	each other. They had like, they were all like traveling all over the world to discover new
2210220	2215260	dinosaurs. And it was a big like, it was called the bone wars. It's really fascinating. It really
2215260	2220780	is called the bone wars. So they were like hurrying up to like discover more. So the one guy started
2220780	2226540	putting together different heads and bodies and calling them new species just just for the just
2226540	2231260	for the just to get and he totally won. And the other guy got totally discredited. And then after
2231260	2237260	this, the winner died to find out that he made up all these dinosaurs, including the brontosaurus.
2237260	2241980	But as far as the winner knows, he died with the belt. He died champion. Oh, he died. He died with
2241980	2247660	six puppies licking his nipples. But the winner knew he was cheating. He died knowing he was a
2247660	2252940	fraud. But yeah, but he had hoaxed the world and probably, you know, a person that does that
2252940	2258700	probably died happy, probably slept like a baby. What a cock. I know. Like, like, like, like, like,
2258700	2265420	use Christ to resurrect him just to slap him in the face for the damage that does in the science
2265420	2270140	versus religion wars. They're like, you fucking idiots. Do you know, do you know what a fucking
2270140	2277340	meal? Yeah, look at this. Oh, man. Like, like, like, there are people out there publishing
2277340	2282860	coloring books teaching children that dinosaurs didn't exist, that bones were buried by the devil
2282860	2288380	and the people that made space lab in the 70s so that we could dig them up in the 80s and pretend
2288380	2293820	there were the dinosaurs like, like, like warping children's brains. Did you see that fourth grade
2293820	2299580	test from some Christian school that was like, when was the earth created? It says 6,000 years.
2299580	2305580	Did humans and dinosaurs live together? Yes. Like, it's all, it's all like super creationist. It
2305580	2312060	came out like three, four days ago. It's on tumbler. It's on tumbler. I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta,
2312060	2316780	I gotta, I gotta draw the line there. That's where, that's where I would care about politics.
2316780	2321180	Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Yeah, kid doesn't even have a chance. That's not politics. That's
2321180	2326220	just ignorance. That's just, well, everyone that's passionate about something political,
2326220	2329580	like, that's their big thing. This isn't even politics. This is a fucking holy war. I'm going
2329580	2335420	to blow up this clinic. Sorry, what? That's like, for people who are anti-religion,
2336060	2341580	we are anti-religion because of people like... Yeah, well, that's what he's saying. The, the,
2341580	2346940	the town hall is crying out. Yes, that, that's why exactly, yes, the, the, the people who are
2346940	2352060	anti-religion, who let's call it the Bill Maher end of the spectrum, like, that is, that's, that
2352060	2358140	is the kick in the shins to which they're reacting. I, I absolutely understand that. And I, I, you know,
2358140	2364220	like, like, like, like, you know, obviously if there was a big rumble, I'm not going to, you know,
2364220	2369180	I'm not going to bring a bike chain to the Christian side of it. Like, like, like I, but,
2369260	2377100	but my, my only point is that I, like, if, if we know that people are kind of dumb,
2378620	2386940	then, and, and we, and we know that what kind of motivates them is like, anger at smart people,
2386940	2393180	like, like, you know, what good is like a bunch of smart people stepping on their face going to do?
2393900	2398460	I don't know. I have no, I don't know. This was going to lose everybody. I'm sure this is not the
2398460	2403660	audience for this. I, I watched the player's championship, the golf thing that Tiger won today.
2403660	2408300	And, and the commentators are very good. They know a lot about golf. They look at everybody's
2408300	2412380	swing and they know exactly what's going on. They're very, they know everything about grass,
2412380	2415900	you know, what kind of grass does what, and they can read the grain. It's kind of fascinating,
2415900	2419740	the amount of knowledge it goes into. I'm not a great golfer. I'm not an avid golfer. I like,
2419740	2424700	I do, and I suck, but there's a thing now because of TV and because somebody heard
2425340	2430140	the first time was, I don't know if it was because of Billy Madison or what's, what's the golf one?
2430140	2436380	Happy Madison. Happy Gilmore. Happy Gilmore. Sorry. I was, I always do that. I always do that,
2436380	2441580	too. And he named his production company like a mixture of the two, just to fuck with old people.
2443420	2448060	Every single time Tiger and a lot of other like popular golfers strike the ball.
2448060	2453900	There's, there's, there's eight douche bags with the same khaki pants on the same shirt and the
2453900	2458700	same tailor made ball cap and they all yell get in the hole, but it'll be the tee shot and a par
2458700	2464860	fucking five. It's six. The hole is 550 yards away. That ball's not going in the hole. Oh yeah. And so
2464860	2469820	everybody else get in the hole, but now it's because it's because they've heard these famous
2469820	2474380	calls of a great putt that somebody made and like, I'm the guy that that was my get in the hole when
2474380	2478540	Tiger did that thing. So now everybody's trying to beat each other to get in the hole, but they have
2478540	2485180	to wait. Like also like with camera clicks. So you've got all these 75 IQ fuckers that are
2485180	2492060	addressing the exact same outfit. The homogeneity of golf fans attire is troubling to me. It should
2492060	2497500	not be that much fucking khaki on that many pale white people. And it's just, it's really disturbing.
2497500	2504860	It's really Nurembergy and gross. Too much brown fabric. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. I had a great time at the
2504860	2514060	tournament. Little Nurembergy, but so today as crystal not dish out here, little joint division ish.
2514060	2519580	The commentators are all very clearly intelligent people and they, they, they, they crack wise.
2519580	2523660	They can be quite poetic sometimes in their call of the, you know, the boringness of golf that can
2523660	2529100	be in that. And, uh, there were these guys all had like spelled out Sergio for Sergio Garcia. And
2529100	2533340	they all lined up and the guy and they all yelled like people Las Vegas or like whatever it might
2533420	2537340	like some shit like it, uh, whenever they would never hit the ball. And the commentators don't
2537340	2541340	say anything. They don't, they don't justify it. They don't get angry at it. They like, I think
2541340	2546140	that's very classy of them, but it has to stop because today in the final, uh, one of the final
2546140	2551100	holes, big, important putt, millions of dollars in the line. So it goes, copy Mother's Day Bob.
2556380	2562300	So you're saying that's like organized religion. I'm saying, I think the average IQ is dumb. The
2562380	2568300	average and you get any giant group of strangers. The average IQ are the people that are, are,
2568300	2573420	work for earth link or for AT&T and you're like, that's why customer service is so infuriating
2573420	2578220	because they're not the smartest people in society doing that. And you have to remember that the
2578220	2582380	people that run around and want to stand too close to tiger's ball and be an asshole and be in the
2582380	2587340	way and yell that those are regular people and they have smooth parts of their brain where they
2587340	2596380	should be cursed. That should be some nooks and crannies in there. And so we end up being elitist
2596380	2604780	anyway. We could be elitist and compassionate. I don't think people are dumb. I think in some
2604780	2610540	ways truth is public opinion. And so if you're surrounded by people who are all saying the same
2610540	2614140	thing, it's something you don't really question. So if you're wearing khakis and you run by all
2614140	2618460	these guys and this is just what we do on their own, they might be smart when they're all together
2618460	2622780	and they're like, yeah, get in the ball, get in the hole or whatever they fucking yell. It becomes
2622780	2627580	the thing to do. And that's how like, you know, an array and religion and all of that. The problem
2627580	2631340	with getting the hole is and I thought about it, I was like, say something else. But the thing is,
2631340	2639820	what else would you say? I have a dream. That is the fastest way to say it. Yeah, they should have
2639820	2643980	Martin Luther King quotes. One percent of the population has 99% of its wealth.
2645580	2647020	Ask them what your country can do for you.
2650300	2653420	I was thinking there was another. If voting was powerful, it'd be illegal.
2655820	2659980	A few years ago, there was a school, this is going back a little bit to that. They had a creation
2659980	2665500	science fair where all the projects had to support creationism or disprove evolution. The girl who
2665500	2670700	came in first place, she took a frog in a tank and she said, it's not a lizard yet.
2673260	2679340	Not so different. She took a glass jar, put sand and rocks inside it, put it in the cupboard,
2679340	2685740	pull it out a week later, nothing had evolved. So evolution disproved. But I would have been so
2685740	2692220	awesome if she pulled it out and there was like a tiny giraffe in there. And one day science will
2692300	2698380	put that tiny giraffe there. There goes first place. I've had time to stew about this very valid
2698380	2705820	thing because I heard myself saying, I mean, look, God damn it. We've burnt women at the
2705820	2712940	stake. We've drilled holes in people's heads. So much has been done wrong by powerful people
2712940	2723660	in the name of religion. It's not religion's fault. It is powerful people's fault. They will
2723660	2730220	abuse anything you give them. If you replace religion with science or money, rich old white
2730220	2734540	people are going to burn women at the stake. They're going to do it for whatever reason.
2734540	2738140	They're going to do it because they hate women and they want to set something on fire.
2738140	2743900	And the women are all around. Because how the fuck can you twist a guy
2743900	2750060	walking around saying everyone love each other the wrong way? They figured out how. It ended with a
2750060	2759180	McDonald's in Rome with a guy in a funny hat surrounded by gold bowls with different colors,
2759180	2764620	smoke coming out of a chimney. How do you twist Thomas Jefferson around and end with two parties
2764620	2769500	arguing and having conventions that never existed where they're agreeing on what they're
2769500	2773420	going to debate about with the League of Women Voters going, you know what? We can't moderate
2773420	2778540	this anymore. Fuck this. You guys are insane. This is a conspiracy against everyone poor.
2780300	2788380	How do you twist that shit around? The answer is because you want to. So science is, of course,
2788380	2794060	it's the best religion we've come up with so far because it's a pursuit to replace the unknown with
2794060	2802300	the known. It is just as much as religion should be. It's like let's join hands and scour the
2802300	2807660	landscape for this lost child in this amber alert called the search for the meaning of life.
2811500	2816540	I don't care if we find a shoe or a blade of grass with a little extra blood on it.
2816540	2818140	You got one set of footprints.
2821980	2824140	Yeah, that was when I was raping you.
2827740	2834620	How? You're raping her on foot? Yeah, he's up. He works in mysterious ways.
2835820	2840940	I don't know what we're even talking about anymore. But that was a metaphor. You are a
2840940	2846700	rail pass. That was when science carried you, but you went with rape.
2848940	2860860	And God bless me, I always will. But the fight of whether or not we're going to be religious
2860860	2868620	or scientific first, in a very important sense, that fight's already over. When you look at the
2869580	2874860	skyline, as Campbell said, the tallest buildings were always churches back in the days when they
2874860	2879580	were abusing their power. He didn't say that part. But there was a point where the churches
2879580	2883900	were the big tall buildings. That's why churches have that architecture to them, because that was
2883900	2889180	state of the art. How high can we get this building? Then by the time we learned how to
2889180	2895100	make buildings taller, that money and engineering knowledge was coming not from God, but from Fort
2895100	2900300	Knox. So the buildings that are taller than churches now are commercial buildings. And
2900300	2905820	commerce and science has one. You only have to look out your window to see that. The crosses are
2905820	2916060	lower than the antenna, and the NBC logos, and the CNNs, and the whatevers. We beat them.
2916860	2923180	But are we going to become another church? Are we going to become...
2925820	2934460	The thing that they created accidentally or on purpose, and either forgot or never wanted to know,
2935020	2942940	that we all know about, has this idea of a moral code, the idea that we're important to each other.
2943580	2948620	These prophets were popping up 2,000 years ago when we were writing literature. They had this
2948620	2955020	eruption of, okay, this guy suddenly became a revolutionary, and then he got killed for it.
2955020	2960460	This guy, too. This guy said stuff shit all over the globe. It was happening roughly at the same
2960460	2967500	time as we were becoming powerful enough to kill each other. We weren't taking each other seriously
2967500	2974140	enough. We have it within us unconsciously as we start to get more and more crowded together,
2974140	2980380	and the guns start to grow on trees and be available in bubble gum machines. We have it
2980380	2985660	in us to do stuff with our brains that will make it possible for guns to be available in
2985660	2991340	gumball machines, and nobody to get hurt. Less people than you'd think. For the lights to go
2991340	2995020	out in New York for a whole night, and nobody gets hurt. The ice cream just melts, and they eat it
2995020	3002620	together for wonderful things to happen, no matter how little opinion we have of ourselves.
3003740	3011260	We've achieved magnificent things, both because science continues to prove maniacs wrong, but also
3011260	3017660	because as that happens, human beings continue to reveal themselves to have the power to police
3017660	3026380	themselves. The monster inside of us. When the guys in the lab coats come out, and they go like,
3026380	3033980	okay, I just figured it out. What happened? 1.00003 seconds after the universe was created.
3035020	3046540	We now know that a Zdron made of Hebron. That guy, his job is to focus on that stuff really hard,
3046540	3052140	to the exclusion probably of a lot of thought about whether or not we should hit each other in
3052140	3057980	the face over a game of checkers and stuff. That guy might be a great person, he might be a terrible
3057980	3064460	person, personality wise. His brain is given over to forging into that unknown territory and
3064460	3070860	reporting back to us what happens to a parsec when it becomes a kweebon or whatever. We in the
3070860	3078540	mainstream, smart or stupid relative to that guy, when we hear that a kweebon is actually a heebon,
3083900	3092380	we have to be good people still. The more we get rid of God, the more we shove that stuff aside,
3092380	3099260	the more we actually need to supplant it with some kind of code, some kind of culture. It's
3099260	3106140	already been laid out for us. Roddenberry, that's why he was so impacted because he saw it. He saw
3108620	3113980	the Vulcan mythology where they were related to Romulans and they became super
3113980	3118700	fucking intelligent and able to destroy themselves and made a memetic decision to evolve.
3118700	3124140	So we got to go with logic now. Logic says don't punch someone in the face just because
3124140	3131180	you think he likes your girlfriend or because you want more oil or logic, make a decision about
3131180	3137660	the species and blah, blah, blah. We know that science is supposed to beget this higher state
3137660	3142060	of being, but right now we're caught in this puberty where science is only making us beat
3142060	3147580	up our dad on prom night. We're just being a little bit destructive, I think. We have to work
3147580	3152140	it out a little bit. Don't you think there's a churchification of science going on though?
3152700	3156860	Because I feel that... That's what I'm worried about. Yeah, no, but that's happening. That's the
3156860	3163020	thing. And look, this paleontologist was doing the choir boy molestation of creating dinosaurs.
3164380	3171100	He was making him up. I would say not as bad, but continue. It happens. There's people that won't
3171100	3178300	listen to evidence because they just assume that a given principle is just law and
3178380	3183340	unchangeable. And rather than go back and look at evidence, they're like, no, this is what I know.
3183340	3186700	This is my Bible, so I'm not going to question it. But that's the whole point of science.
3188220	3192700	Within their ranks, thank God science is intelligent enough to have as its code
3193260	3201020	has peer review and skepticism baked into it. There are these dogmatic old men who make it
3201020	3205180	hard on the young men coming up. Young women, why do they do that? Yeah, stratifications though.
3205500	3209580	Well, it's too late for me. Make your own lightsaber and move on.
3211420	3217820	Throw me in the pit and watch me shoot lightning as I die. But there's always going to be an old
3217820	3223660	boys club that's always... Especially in anthropology, where it's like you have to dig
3223660	3227340	up a bone to prove something. And then in the meantime, it's all these theories. And like
3227340	3232860	Elaine Morgan, one of my heroes who created the aquatic ape theory was bullied by blah, blah, blah,
3232860	3239740	different episodes. But take a step back from that now, if you're willing to look at that and
3239740	3247420	say, okay, scientist A is kind of a dick to scientist C within their community because
3247420	3253980	scientist C hasn't paid his dues and this theory's got traction and people don't want it to be true
3253980	3259660	and don't want to take new hypotheses seriously. Now you take a step back from that and look at
3259660	3266940	how science is that condescending to someone with an IQ over 75 who happens to choose to
3266940	3273660	have a relationship with the unknown, an umbilical point coming out of their forebrain and into the
3273660	3282060	into the void to comfort them in the face of all this chaos to personify as is not only our right,
3282060	3289740	but fuck our instinct. As these chatterbox primates, creating religion comes as naturally
3289740	3295820	to us as I've said, pooping. And there's a lot of poop that needs to be flushed away, but thank God
3295820	3303260	we look at it sometimes in case there's blood in it and we go to the doctor. It's coming out of us.
3303260	3307900	Religion is coming out of us. And you just take a look at it every time you blow your nose.
3308460	3313500	Are you saying religion is like bloody poop? There's blood in the shit. Bad religion, bad religion.
3313500	3321180	There might also once in a while be a nugget of gold in your poop. Not as often. Maybe the metaphor
3321180	3327580	doesn't work. Human beings create a lot of things that are easily dismissible because they happen
3327580	3333580	so naturally. The fact that I'm talking, I mean it's amazing. We've written language, written
3333580	3337420	language is this mimetic thing. It's like babies just at two years old just go, hey give me a glass
3337420	3345260	of water. Whoa, what the fuck? That's genetic. That's like an actual happening, like we're like
3345260	3351900	weird macaws. We just start talking. It's crazy. And when we do, we start cognifying differently.
3351900	3356140	We start recognizing how to make maps and shit that we wouldn't understand if we didn't have
3356140	3362300	language. What a podcast. They say people who speak different languages, different grammatical
3362300	3366700	structures approach problem solving differently. So it really does sort of feed into each other.
3366700	3370860	Because I can choose to say that you're sitting on top of the box or that the box has you on top
3370860	3375340	of it. Yeah, and the way you think of it. The language is absolutely thought. And literally
3375340	3379740	when you're speaking a different language, it's different parts of your brain are going. So it's
3379740	3384380	like the pathways are different. I can feel it if I want to switch to Urdu that my brain works
3384380	3388300	slightly differently. When I switch back, it like takes me a second to lock back into it. That's
3388300	3395340	what they say about Urdu. You never go back. Once you go to Urdu, you never go back. Yeah,
3395340	3400940	that's what I was trying to. In Urdu, you say if you go back, you never Urdu. See,
3400940	3408060	that's why that's the thing. It's a beautiful language. And by the way, beautiful. Put a big
3408060	3415500	fat asterisk. My favorite operas are Urdu. The fact that language is thought, the fact that
3415500	3421900	we think as we speak and that the words we say are actually sort of the pathways of our brain.
3421900	3428060	That is a lot different from saying that certain specific words are magical and need to be either
3428060	3436380	celebrated or buried. That's dumb. There's no smart way to approach that. But I do think
3436940	3441420	words do have meaning. You were saying that earlier. And people do use words differently to
3441420	3445820	oppress or further a certain thing. There's a reason. It's called pro-choice and pro-life and
3445820	3450780	not pro-abortion. So these words do have certain... And that's what the Nazis did a lot instead of
3450780	3455420	calling it, when I kill all the Jews, it was the final solution. And when they had the Jews
3455420	3461660	sort of running the camps, that was called joy division. So those words, they're not just words.
3461660	3466380	They can sort of be used to have people thinking a certain way. Yeah. And when you have a cold,
3466380	3471180	there's snot on your face, but an anti-snot campaign is not going to come up with the cure.
3472140	3477420	It is just, just keep wiping and whatever. I guess that's better than letting it sit on your face.
3477500	3484060	That's a social custom. Don't put your elbows on the table. Don't say the n-word around black
3484060	3488540	people. You know why? Here's why. Here's why I don't do it. I think I know why.
3490220	3495100	Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. Here's why I stopped doing it from when I was like 25 and I
3495100	3498940	was like all punk rock. I'm like, you're not going to book it. Like Quentin Tarantino said once,
3498940	3502220	and I do agree with this fundamentally, when a word has that much power, you should be screaming
3502220	3507100	it from the rooftops. He's right. I mean, in the way that you should be right, he's right.
3507900	3511900	But you're not going to get that, but it's always going to be used in a certain way.
3511900	3515900	Well, no, no, no, no, no. Here's why I don't say that. Here's why I say the n-word instead
3515900	3520700	of actually saying the n-word. It's because it's for the same reason I don't say the c-word like,
3520700	3529740	like, like, like as often as I want to. When I'm driving inside my car, everybody's a cut.
3529820	3536940	I'm a cut. The old lady's a cut. The dog is a cut. When I'm kissing my girlfriend goodbye
3536940	3543260	to go to work in the morning, she's an n-word. The n-word privately with me and my girlfriend,
3543260	3547740	like, that word is like fucking amazing. It's like saying like sugar pie or whatever.
3547740	3556700	Yeah, I love it. And I love it because I'm not supposed to and so it's tender and delicious
3556700	3561900	and wonderful in your mouth, like a piece of fucking bacon. Tough titties for the people who
3561900	3567820	made it that flavorful on all sides of the issue. In the end, I'm a guy inside my house. I got a
3567820	3573420	couple of ways to be impacting to myself. The reason I don't say the n-word and cunt.
3574620	3582460	The reason I don't say it around other people in mixed company, as it were, is because of the social,
3583340	3590380	social pressure. I'm rolling my eyes at the dumb dot connection to the words of mixed company.
3592940	3600220	The social anxiety and pressure that it puts people on. For the same reason I cover my
3600220	3606220	mouth when I sneeze or say bless you when someone else sneezes, I don't want to deal with it. That's
3606220	3610620	why I don't, I don't want to make other people deal with it. That's called politeness. It has
3610620	3616060	nothing to do with fixing society. But like in your house, that word is powerless. It means
3616060	3619420	nothing. You're screaming it from the rooftops. It says nothing negative about that word, but when
3619420	3624140	you say it in public, there is a connotation to it that you can't control. When you say it and
3624140	3628140	that word's out there, even though whatever your... But I can easily say it without the connotation.
3628140	3633100	Louis C.K. and every great comic has had a whole 10-minute bit that relieves the pressure. Thank
3633100	3637580	God. I could be one of those people. I could come out and do 10 minutes and say the n-word.
3637900	3641020	And everybody would be laughing and black people included, but the black people would have to
3641020	3646700	deal with people glancing at them and feeling, even if they didn't. I'm too lazy to make anyone
3646700	3651420	deal with that. I don't want to do it. That tree could be cut down by a different lumberjack with
3651420	3659100	a better plaid shirt. Me, I'll stick to metaphor crafted. That's my bread and butter.
3659100	3669180	The only point I'm making, when we get bogged down in the technical aspect of whether or not
3669180	3672940	the words have power, then the answer, we both agree that the... Yeah. Oh, yeah. Look at the word.
3672940	3677020	Look at the powerful word. It has power. But then there's subsets of that topic. You go,
3678380	3684700	the power doesn't mean... It's like the snot has power when you have a cold. You could scrape it,
3684700	3689420	put it in a jar and centrifuge it and find out what kind of cold you have. There's all kinds
3689420	3696460	of things you could do with the snot. You cannot cure the cold by inventing something that makes
3696460	3703820	the snot go away, by making snot illegal. The person's immune system is being impacted. Their
3703820	3710620	body is generating shit in their body. The final end result is there's some snot coming out of their
3710620	3716540	nose. We're communicating with each other and there's a word that, thank God there's a word,
3717660	3724780	that is a tendril to all of this legacy. If there weren't a word, holy shit. There ain't
3724780	3730780	no word for the fact that we killed a bunch of Indians because it matters less. We don't have
3730780	3738540	a fucking word to dance around and be polite about, we just did it and moved on. But I do think words
3738540	3745100	do affect... It's not just that the word is a symptom of an ill or whatever, the way your
3745100	3752780	thing's not cold. I also do think words can affect the way a person thinks and feels about something.
3754380	3760860	If they say it, if they say it and their intent is... Yeah, of course you reveal through your
3760860	3764380	language whether or not you give a shit whether the person next to you is a human being or not.
3764380	3768780	No, but just also like going back to just saying pro-life. That sounds very positive and if you
3768780	3773180	keep saying that pro-life, pro-life, pro-life, it sort of affects how you think about that issue.
3773180	3778940	Whereas if you're saying pro-choice, then it's something else. I really do think words can affect
3778940	3784780	the way people think about certain things. And again, if you read stuff about what happened in
3784780	3789580	concentration camps, they changed what words mean and it changed the way people thought.
3789580	3796940	That's the first thing they do. Yeah, that's what we're doing. That is the way you recognize
3796940	3805420	fascism is people who are running for media and language. That's the place they go because the
3805420	3812540	weak and the busy, the overworked and the tired and the desperate only have language to connect
3812540	3817580	to other people through and media. And so people who find themselves in positions of moderate power,
3817580	3822460	they run to the tallest buildings with the dishes on them and they start tweaking the way we're
3822460	3827340	communicating with those people. They make sure that we're obsessed with race. They make sure that
3827340	3834940	the 99 percent think of themselves as 15 percent black and 85 percent this. Instead of just a big
3834940	3839980	simple number, they tweak the language that way and that's what's dangerous because the people
3839980	3845260	that are dividing us are speaking language, are speaking pro-life and pro-choice. The people
3845340	3853260	dividing us are speaking n-word and n-word is magical. There is a conspiracy among
3854860	3863980	the dunces to divide us. I don't know. Let's settle this. No, that makes sense to me.
3863980	3868940	At another time. I'm very suspicious. Are we going to settle it now? Yeah, I guarantee it.
3868940	3872540	Well, because I talk too much about Black Widow. If we started from the top of the show.
3872540	3876940	Well, okay. Are going back, are Black Widows poisonous or no? Are they like,
3876940	3882140	Black people? No, Black Widow. Because to answer that question, which is more important,
3882140	3888060	they are, but their mandibles can't pierce human skin. They can't deliver the payload. No one laughed
3888060	3894860	at that. Again, making me think that you actually think I'm racist. I'm not an editor,
3894860	3898700	but there's an easy way to make this sound like you're a racist that wants to be back on community.
3902540	3910460	On a very special fifth season. Yeah. And you're misogynistic. Yeah, yeah. It's stand-up
3910460	3915740	raping and end bombs. It may not be fire for the truth. It's not going to take a lot of editing
3915740	3921820	either. Just a couple snips. At this point in my life, I'm only a product of what other people
3921820	3928460	think about me. So if I make an awesome callback spider black person joke like that and there's
3928460	3931020	silence in the room because they're like, man, he really is racist.
3932540	3936140	It's like, oh, if a third person calls you a horse has asked you by a saddle.
3937980	3941900	I don't think it was people getting uncomfortable. I think it's when you start, when you go into a
3941900	3947900	certain field, like when you're about to clearly make a black joke, it has to be finally crafted.
3947900	3955580	It was. That was amazing. I don't think it's been a great joke. Are Black people poisonous? Yes,
3955580	3963820	but their mandibles can't. I thought that was great. They still disagree. I know. It was not
3963820	3971660	on board. Not on board. If it had been an hilarious joke, that would have overridden
3972460	3976220	people's natural instincts. I know. That's the thing. If you're doing a stand-up bit about
3976220	3981740	the N word, which is why Louis CK can do it, because it's the best bit about that word.
3981740	3987580	It better be the fucking best bit. You know, it can't be like, all right, mom, but I'm not
3987580	3993020	saying I'm not saying I'm the guy who's on your side with the black people mandible piercing joke.
3996860	3999100	How would you say that in Urdu?
3999100	4009900	In Russia, mandible, you pierce mandible. So you don't actually speak Urdu, do you?
4011900	4014940	Yeah, this is just a tan and a speech impediment.
4019820	4023420	I knew it. I fucking knew it. It's the world's best kept secret.
4023420	4029900	Yeah. My name is Chris Mail.
4036300	4043580	All right. I need a female from the audience who can tell us in five minutes about the
4045260	4049980	worst conversation with their mother for Mother's Day that's willing to share it with the podcast
4049980	4057820	audience. Your reward is you get to play Aaron's character in D&D. All right. To the stage, please.
4064940	4069100	She had a very deep frown when she raised her hand, but it doesn't sound like a good story.
4069100	4073580	It's okay if it's bad for some tragic reason. It doesn't have to be a finely crafted comedic thing.
4073580	4076780	Hello. What's your name? Oh, wait, hold on. Give my heart a second.
4081660	4085020	Take all the time you want. I'm Denise. Hey, guys.
4088460	4091180	Hi, I'm Camille. Chris, nice to meet you.
4093740	4100620	I know who you are. Yeah. It would be weird if you didn't and you were here. What's your name?
4100620	4106700	Denise. Denise, okay. Cool. I also love that you speak Urdu, by the way, and English. Do you speak
4106700	4112700	any other languages? Well, I could say Hindi, but it's spoken the same as Urdu, but I could say
4112700	4118380	now I feel bad about only speaking two languages. Do you speak multiple languages? Yeah, I do too.
4118380	4125020	Yeah. Which ones? German, Farsi, and English. Farsi? Yeah. Nice. That's nice, really. Now,
4125020	4129900	is it true in Farsi? Denise, can I ask you this? I had a question on a Persian gal when I was in
4129900	4134060	high school or college. Of course you did. Yeah, because they're beautiful. They're beautiful.
4134860	4142380	Are you Persian? Yes. Yeah. Hubba hubba. If only you hadn't said the C word so many times.
4144700	4147580	It's the only one I'm driving. If only they weren't so hairy. No, I'm just kidding.
4149580	4153420	I didn't say it. Hey, it's hairy like Bill's jerky.
4153420	4161740	Sorry. Bill, we're all together. Is it true or not true that the word for popcorn is elephant
4161740	4167180	farts? Yes, it is. In Farsi, they call popcorn elephant farts, which is adorable. It's gross.
4167180	4173980	What? Can I have some salty elephant farts? Is it a string of syllables that sounds like the English
4173980	4179900	words elephant farts, or are you saying that the colloquial term is elephant farts? It's like going
4179900	4185100	and ordering a burger and saying, can I have some diarrhea in a bun? Like the way burrito is like a
4185100	4191660	little, it's a little pack mule. So elephant farts. Yeah, it looks like an elephant fart would look
4191660	4196940	like it. I like that. Yeah, I think it's adorable. And I would eat them. I would still eat popcorn.
4196940	4201980	What's the word? What do you call it? Can you say it? Yeah, can you say it? Chos efil. No,
4201980	4207420	it's beautiful. Chos means fart and fil is the elephant. It means elephant. Okay, now let me
4207420	4214700	ask you one more. Is it true? If I say the name of the country Costa Rica? Oh my god, yes.
4216620	4222460	You just insulted her uncle. You're totally legit. No, you are obsessed with cunts,
4222460	4233500	which I understand. I might have put that more delicately. I will listen to you say it a couple
4233580	4241500	more times. I know. Weirdly, it's like having a gangster rapper up here. Just say the n-word for it.
4242940	4248140	Well, no, she's not her. I grew up in Germany and they called me sand nigger my entire childhood.
4248140	4252220	All right, so that's how she can do it. As long as she says the word stand before it.
4253900	4258140	You and I can say it. It's a bubble. It's a bubble. Sandroom. I can do it.
4258140	4269260	What's up my sandroom? Tell them what Costa Rica is. Costa Rica means, um, your cunt smells, baby.
4270460	4274620	Hey, that's cus, is that, is that pussy? Yeah, cus means pussy. That sort of do too.
4274620	4280140	Guys nodding, are you Persian? Oh, okay. You're like, yeah. He's just into smelly pussy.
4283580	4287740	There's actually a, that's the, that's the license plate for Costa Rica.
4288940	4294140	Costa Rica. And then on the bottom, it says means your, means your pussy smells and farsi.
4295340	4302860	But cus means, cus means pussy. It does. Yeah, cus means pussy. Yeah, I think our languages are.
4302860	4308140	Yeah, we're very connected. Yeah. Now the multi-lingual thing that always bumps me out.
4308140	4311740	I always have a pang of guilt at 40. I'll never know. I'll never as fluently speak more than one
4311740	4317340	language. Like, like we were just talking about how languages thought, which like, I know it
4317340	4324140	doesn't seem pretty obvious that if we actually, if we, the more people that spoke multiple languages,
4324140	4329740	kind of like the more generally like mellow and smarter we'd be, because we would, because that is
4329740	4339980	the practice of, of switch, being able to switch gears. Yeah. Having two points of, of, of, of, of,
4340620	4347340	cognating. It's also, that's a third language I'll make up. It's also, I think, it sounds,
4347340	4352060	it also brings people together, I think, because I've noticed whenever you see a movie, the bad
4352060	4358220	guys, when they speak Arabic or whatever, it's rarely translated. It's just like, oh, they're
4358220	4363260	gibberish. They're the other. But I was watching this movie and this terrible movie with terrorists
4363260	4367820	and the terrorists spoke and it was translated. And I was like, whoa, that's weird. And it turns
4367820	4373900	out he was a good guy, actually. So that's like an interesting thing. I think that's, it's sort of
4373900	4378860	lack of language divides people, lack of knowing what the other. All right. So Denise, what is your
4378860	4384380	Mother's Day tale for us? Oh shit. I was a great, they forgot about it. Yeah. Great calm topic,
4384380	4387740	by the way. We don't have to. We could stick to this. No, it's totally fine. I was just like,
4387740	4392300	that's why I was nervous. So if you don't want to, I, one more thing I wanted to say about language,
4392300	4398780	actually, because one of my fascinations is the way people say bow, wow, wow, or cockadoodle do,
4398780	4402220	or how they say bubbles, like in different languages. Yeah. Like, where is it a kind of
4402220	4407100	onomatopoiet? You want to know what chickens say in Farsi? Yeah. What's, what's, what's cockadoodle
4407100	4412460	do in Farsi? Like, what's the sound that you're going to make me say it? It's so embarrassing.
4412460	4417580	What is it more than cockadoodle do? Yes. I'd rather say, I'd rather say like,
4417580	4431740	cosa doodle cosa. It's like, it's so weird. It sounds like, Joan Crawford is a rooster
4431740	4438220	coming into your room at three in the morning. It sounds like Barbara Streisand got raped by
4438220	4446780	camel and somehow it's just like, Oh, now we're talking. What a horrible. I guess that's what the
4446860	4453660	hump means. I'm sorry. Um, when there was only one set of hoofs, say it one more time and picture
4453660	4461660	Barbara Streisand. Say it one more time. So do you want to hear about my mom? I want to hear about
4461660	4467260	America's mom, Barbara Streisand. Just, just one more time. Just everyone picture Barbara Streisand
4467260	4473420	in the guilt trip with Seth Rogen and a camel and a camel. Just say it.
4474300	4479980	What? Oh, the camel's not into it.
4483100	4491340	That was consensual. We don't want to. I felt bad for the camel. Seth Rogen's the camel. He's doing
4491340	4497980	great. All right. So what's your mother's day story, Denise? So, um, I moved here after high
4497980	4504780	school. Can I ask you one more question? Of course. Sorry. You're Iranian. Your name's Denise. Yeah.
4504780	4509580	Is that, are you Christian? Iranian Christian? No, I'm actually, don't hate me. I'm Muslim and
4509580	4513900	Jewish and I was raised by, and I was, and I was, this is an option.
4517660	4524060	It's like a neomology. Unfortunately, yes. If vanilla and chocolate hated each other. Yeah.
4524060	4529260	And then I was raised by Germans in Germany. So yeah, we're just fucked up if you think about it.
4529900	4534540	But so my mom still lives in, in Germany. Do your parents have like the house divided and there's
4534540	4541180	like a fight in the. Yeah. Well, Jews sleep in, in the closet, of course. And no.
4541180	4550460	Sorry. No. Um, no. Not the attic. But I, I called her.
4555020	4559820	I do, as somebody who is part Jewish, part Muslim, I do think it's interesting that your
4559820	4563180	metaphor for the sound of rooster makes is Barbra Streisand and a camel.
4563180	4573820	See, I don't like that camel Muslim connection. What is that? You're not, you're, you're a tan
4573820	4579180	guy with a speech impediment. Shut up. I'm standing up for the people I resemble, but I'm not.
4583980	4585900	Sorry, your mom's story.
4594140	4597100	I'm not saying the show is long and far seen, but
4601020	4606140	go ahead. Okay. So, uh, so I called her and I was like, mom, you know, thanks for raising
4606140	4610380	me basically on your own. And you know, I love you. She was like, well, did you think about
4611100	4614380	what's going to happen with me when I'm old? Because you're in America. So
4615020	4617980	if your stepdad dies, like what the fuck is going to happen with me? I was like,
4617980	4624300	that's a downer. Like I just called her and I just called to say, Hey, and you know,
4624300	4628300	thank you for everything. And she was like, I'm going to die alone because you're my only child
4628300	4633900	and you're over there. Did you look young enough that I'm allowed to ask how old you are? No,
4633900	4639180	you're not. I'm not really just that I'm not that old, but like, I want to be able to lie about it
4639180	4648620	in five years. Okay. So that's, that's great. LA banking, but I'm still on the very, I'm 24 now,
4648620	4656940	but I want to be 24 in five years. I want to be 26 forever. Yeah. So you're 26.
4659900	4664060	Well, the reason I, the reason I wanted to ask is because I'm 40 and I live in constant dread of
4664220	4669020	like, I still feel like a baby and I, my relationship with my parents is emotionally
4669020	4673020	touch and go, meaning like, not, not touch and go. Like I love him. I hate him. Just like,
4673020	4679740	I feel like, like, like I'm supposed to have kids a long time ago. And also now I'm at that era where
4681020	4687900	according to American tradition, if nothing else, like my parents are, what do you do? Do you knock
4687900	4691820	on wood? What am I about to say? This is just explaining a thought. It's going to do whatever
4692140	4700780	getting the hole does. I'm sorry. This is just, this is just the way your thought works. Okay.
4700780	4705740	Please honor my candor. I'm just thinking in my head, I'm 40. My parents are 20 years older than
4705740	4710220	me and more. And aren't they going to start getting sick soon? And when they do, what are
4710220	4716860	my obligations to them? And how is that going to work? Because we don't like my, my, my family has
4716860	4722860	always been just very reptilian. You know, it's like we, we, we just kind of like, I don't know,
4722860	4730380	like, like what am I supposed to do? What do I want to do? You just send them money to be able to live
4730380	4736140	through the, you know, but her mom, that was, I can't even visit my mom. If I was you,
4736140	4741660	I'd be flying there just with my own, whatever. I went there. Is your mom in Iran? No, no,
4741660	4745820	she's in Germany. Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, I would argue with you guys at this point, like, well,
4745820	4752220	I'm not that rich, but I now have a fifth season television show. So I can, I can probably afford
4752220	4757260	some air hoses for the parents. My mom didn't know what the fuck mother's day was five years ago.
4757260	4764700	And now she's super offended if I don't call it first world problems. Super into it now.
4764700	4776460	Super Hinduist. Super Hinduist. No, don't clap. Stop. Stop. No, don't clap. Stop it. She's Muslim.
4781020	4786620	Yeah, double down, buddy. You can't make Muslim and Hindu jokes about my parents.
4786620	4789660	I think you'll find I can and do.
4793420	4794860	That was a real hit and don't.
4797260	4803340	All right, let's play some D&D, shall we, everybody? Denise, please stay. You're going to
4803340	4810300	play Erin's character. She's at home with the cold. She's never done D&D before. I played D&D before.
4810300	4815660	I actually was a drow, so no worries. I just want to know what her character. Fuck everybody
4815660	4821500	that says girls don't play D&D. Fuck you. No, they do. They just like that. Not all suck at it. I'm
4821500	4826140	going to kick your ass. It's just that post character generating shopping trip always ends up in.
4826140	4831020	Adam said, told me to kill your character and rape it. Okay. Oh, his character. Okay.
4832140	4837580	Are we already dead? Anyway, we almost died last time. Did you hear last week? Did you hear last
4837580	4841660	week's episode Denise? I did not. I was at a bat mitzvah. Well, it ended with all of us being
4841660	4846380	apparently choked to death by a shadow of monsters. Like for those of you listening.
4846380	4853820	Oh, he's going to recap it for us, right? I often do. I have to say, I wasn't here and
4854780	4859260	miraculously, even though it kept being brought up, nobody fucked my character last week.
4859260	4865660	We didn't get to. Because we were all dying. I know. And sex was not on our minds. It still
4865660	4871820	kind of was. I sort of floated it. Nobody seemed into it. Sounds like all right. All right. So,
4871820	4874620	yeah, so we were hanging by a thread. Dan, you want to go grab the character sheets and we'll
4874620	4879660	get this bitch kitty underway. Yeah. Do you have the music? Did you bring the music cues back?
4879660	4884220	Yes, I do. I have the music. Spencer, are you ready to get us up to date? I'd like to think so.
4884220	4891100	All right, Spencer, everybody. After a confusing episode with a possessed Krista Berg and a brief
4891100	4896380	return of Kyle and Tylenol with Cody, as well as a dangerous brush with a large black gait,
4896380	4901260	our heroes were accosted by a troop of blade-armed horrors. At first, the gang was winning, cutting
4901260	4906300	down two of the shadowy foes in an instant. Soon after, however, the tides of battle shifted and
4906300	4911820	the shadows tried a new tactic, choking out the opponents with their smoky and substantial forms.
4911820	4917580	As combat wore on, two more shadows were defeated, but Moraine and Sharpie were caught by the limbs,
4917580	4923260	dimming their minds and doling their senses as they choked them to death. After trying to avoid
4923260	4928540	the grappling shadows, Moraine fired some arrows wildly before passing out from suffocation.
4928540	4933340	The Sharpie slung fiery bolts at the shadows and managed to heal the party with the soul of growth,
4933340	4939500	but in the end was also overcome by the shadowy smoke. Two losing consciousness, the remaining
4939500	4945180	shadows squared off against Cork and Chris, who fucked around too much, trying to pull crazy tricks
4945180	4951260	that failed utterly. They too were choked out and lost consciousness in short order.
4951900	4957500	The party fly defeated on the floor, and as their unconscious forms were dragged into the black
4957500	4963900	gate by the shadowy assailants, who would know how they would get to their home? Yeah, so I fucked
4963900	4973980	that one up. Can't hit every audio cue. This podcast is brought to you by... The Bisco!
4975900	4977340	Thank you, Spencer. Put a cookie on it!
4982220	4986460	I knew I'd have to fail it. The Bisco, which in Urdu means your mom has a cock.
4988860	4994700	Yeah. The Bisco's cock, co is mother.
4998860	5002780	Sometimes that's all there is, you know? There's nothing more to be said
5002860	5006940	than what's already been said. Sometimes you have a punchline, sometimes you just stop talking.
5009180	5013340	Just pull the ripcord and just let the shoot deploy, man. You guys are on your own. Exactly.
5014300	5018300	Speaking of on our own, so I'm gonna imagine that we need to be told what the hell is going on. Yeah,
5018300	5023100	you guys aren't even awake yet. It's crazy. Anyway. We all blacked out, right? Yeah, no,
5023100	5031180	you're dead now. Reroll characters. Let's go. Wait, we're dead? No. I knew it. I had a feeling
5031180	5035820	this was like in a video game. Like when you, you know, you have no choice. You just lose all your
5035820	5040780	equipment. Someone hits you on the head. Close. Yeah, yeah. Your eyes slowly drift open, a dry
5040780	5045500	burning clawing at your lids and your throat and your body throbs with pain. You can feel a heavy
5045500	5051180	burden weighing on your neck, shoulders, wrists, ankles, knees and toes. You look down, knees and
5051180	5059500	toes, knees and toes, and ankles, knees and toes, knees and toes. What's that in throbbing pain?
5059500	5066460	In our pelvises? No, the mentioned body parts are weighed down by burdens, which looking down,
5066460	5071500	you see are in fact shadowy chains binding your arms and legs to those of your adventurer friends,
5071500	5078300	like some sort of chain gang. So we're all chained together. Yeah, you're chained to this,
5078300	5084060	you're chained and guarded by multiple, I'd say nine of these same blade armed guards.
5084060	5090220	Your chains are bound to a black wall that extends easily about 300 feet tall or more,
5090220	5096860	and creating a huge ring shaped arena sort of donut. Arena. Inside this donut, yeah.
5097420	5100620	And are we all together or are we at different parts around this? You guys are chained to each
5100620	5104940	other. So you're pretty close. You know, you're maybe in like an eight foot train.
5104940	5109660	So we're at the edge of a circular wall that goes 300 feet in the air. And it's a donut.
5109660	5115180	Atop the far walls, you can see tiered steps of ashy stone gray rings like some sort of amphitheater
5115180	5120540	stadium packed into the stepped rows of gray risers or thousands upon thousands of silhouettes,
5120540	5124460	forming a massive crowd of pulsing, undulating. I don't like this trope. Yeah.
5129260	5135900	It's a classic. It's a classic. Yeah, there's a reason it's a trope, Dan. Yeah, because it pits
5135980	5143100	the protagonist in a horrible situation that I'm going to fail at. Are they going to make us go
5143100	5151900	like Spock against Kirk in this? Who knows? I kill myself instantly. That's a fair action.
5152700	5153980	Do you want to do that? No.
5158220	5161420	But if we're going to be in a human centipede at any point, I call the front.
5161420	5165660	I got middle. I got middle.
5169820	5174940	A lot of people don't know last second to last is actually for various biological and
5174940	5179420	toxicological reasons. It's the same as being on Space Mountain. They call it the human centipede
5179420	5187260	catbird seed. It actually results in you being pretty healthy after three weeks if you get cut
5187260	5195580	loose. Did you see that? There's a human centipede sequel and there's a guy, the sequel is about a
5195580	5199900	guy who saw human centipede and wants to try it on his own. And then there's a scene where he has
5199900	5204300	everybody in a warehouse and then he walks out of the room and I think it's the first dialogue in
5204300	5211980	the movie. A guy who heard a reference to human centipede goes like, it's from a movie. Did you
5211980	5217500	see it? The human centipede. He's going to sew us ass to mouth. And everyone starts going,
5223260	5228460	he's going to sew us ass to mouth. I wouldn't have an immediate visceral reaction to that
5228460	5231660	the way I would. He's going to pull out our fingernails or he's going to eat our
5231660	5235020	eat our livers. He's going to sew us ass to mouth. I'd be like, wait, what, what, what?
5235740	5241340	But maybe they've seen the first movie. Yeah. I mean, I think that's the crime is it's pretty
5241660	5245340	everyone saw the movie and they're like, no, I asked them how they heard about that. Oh,
5246220	5251900	it's like the McDonald's monopoly game. That's why I didn't like the movie predators. You know,
5251900	5255740	the new predator because they referenced the first movie, not as a movie, but they say, oh,
5255740	5259660	you know what he did and then he covered himself in mud. And that's how like it really happened.
5259660	5264060	Like they read it in the Tribune. Yeah. They were like, remember that happened and the predators,
5264060	5270780	they do the same thing. So these guys can like have invisibility cloaks and like homing lasers,
5270780	5276380	but they can't figure out if you cover yourself in mud, they're flabbergasted. They should just
5276380	5286220	have like a water hose on their shoulders. They should just outlaw mud. All right. So what's up
5286220	5292940	Spencer? Yeah. Yeah. So I mentioned there's these nine guys guarding you. Yeah, I totally did.
5293660	5297900	They're looking into the, to the center of this donut and there's even a smaller,
5297980	5303900	like a central raised ring, like a stage kind of situated in the middle. And you can see hanging
5303900	5309580	above the stage is that, that massive glowing gray sun that actually caused your shadows to
5309580	5313980	depart in the first place hanging above the central ring and chained in the central ring.
5313980	5320460	You can see a guy, it looks a lot like breathy. Oh, hey, I have to go pee guys. I'll be right back.
5321260	5325340	I'll be right back. Yeah. What happened? Like in a meta sense. That would be a terrible joke if
5325340	5328300	that were a joke. Yeah. No, go ahead. No, it's my life. This is my life.
5331180	5334540	It happens. It's a serious business. Yeah. We're on our own.
5335980	5345740	Yeah. There's an old Farsi saying about bladder size. Yeah. I only know the English translation.
5346460	5352380	Translate. His black widow does not catch flies.
5355580	5362540	I didn't want to like follow it through. And honestly, my relationship with all of you ended
5362540	5366940	that, that, that, that second time I said something that I think deserved a bigger laugh than I got.
5368140	5371340	And I started to think to myself, I'm just going to edit you laughing in.
5371340	5377500	I'm just going to pick something else. I can't remember what it was. It's called fascism. Yeah.
5377500	5382700	And I'm going to edit that boo out. That guy that booed me. There's nothing you can do that I can't
5383500	5389340	manipulate and control. All right. So we're chained together. There's nine guards. Yeah.
5389340	5393980	There's an arena that we're in. Then there's a stage in front of us. And above it is the glowing
5393980	5399660	sun. And below it is a breathy lookalike. A breathy lookalike. Chained to the arena there.
5399660	5404780	Remind me of who breathy was. He was the guy that we, that turned into a. A wise and old man,
5404780	5410380	very pale with long white hair. You know, rather spindly guy that occasionally turns into a large
5410380	5415100	spidery monster. I call out and say, are you breathy? He can't hear you. I bet it's like a
5415100	5420300	human form. Like a tradition, like a, like if you and I existed in a place where we had to look like
5420300	5428140	spiders, like we would look like the same spider. Did you ever see the arrival with Charlie Sheen?
5428140	5431500	No. He kept seeing Ron Silver everywhere.
5437340	5440620	And then he realized that the aliens only make so many rubber suits.
5442220	5448220	You know, Mattel only issues out so many human costumes. I yell out, have you seen the movie
5448220	5457180	Arrival? He can't hear you. Okay. Are the guards. In fact, everything's eerily silent. Like normally
5457180	5461020	if you're packed in a stadium or something, there'd be some noises, but a case. Well,
5461020	5467500	it's hard to clap when your hands are shadows. Tell me about it. That's the fourth time. No laugh.
5468860	5475580	And it's all going in my memoirs. Are the guards watching us? The guards, as it happens,
5475580	5480140	are watching the central stage. They're looking at this chain man. He looks like they're frightened.
5480140	5485180	Can I summon the monkey and have him free my shackles? The monkey summon is only like once per
5485180	5489420	day. Um, I guess you don't know that it's the same day, but you feel as if you can't cast any
5489420	5494220	more spells. I was passed out. How long was I passed? Not eight hours. Also you haven't,
5494220	5498220	you haven't done them. Do we have our inventory with us or has it all been taken away from us?
5498220	5502460	That's a great question. Fumbling around. You do notice you have your bags and things with you.
5503660	5510940	Okay. All right. Yeah. Crazy. All of a sudden the mood seems to shift and uh, you see the
5510940	5516460	breathy lookalike. He kind of, his neck snaps to the left as if he's suddenly transfixed by
5516460	5521180	something. Oh boy. Yeah. Yeah. Following his gaze, you could see a black shadow streaking
5521180	5526460	across the gray floor of the stadium towards the old gray man. This is where we watch the guy in
5526460	5539020	front of us. Yeah, get it. Yeah. I said it. Do you want to guess what happens next? Hey, don't punish
5539020	5544380	our savvy. Just that's exactly what you do in Dungeons and Dragons. You punish meta gaming.
5546220	5550860	That's a whole thing. Well then I'll just sit here and go like, Ooh, wow. What's going to happen
5553100	5559820	and get rewarded for it. That's all I ever wanted. That path ends with fake brontosauruses.
5562140	5566620	I'll just, I'll just do what I'll just go where the heat is. Yeah. That's fine. You do you,
5566620	5576380	Dan. You do you. I'll be, I'll be good cop. Okay. Oh my God. What's going to happen? I'm so glad you
5576380	5588940	asked. I jibber in feudal anguish. I make the farsi chicken sound. We got to figure out how to,
5588940	5594300	we, we, we got the time it takes for this breathy guy to die until we figure out what the fuck we're
5594300	5599900	going to do. Yeah. That's why I don't like this. I'm bad at chess. I don't like the pressure. I, I,
5599900	5605420	I use all my barbarian strength to, to, to, to, to rail against my chains to see if that does anything.
5608540	5612380	You struggle with all your might, but these chains are even stronger than iron.
5613820	5618940	Can I ask as a sidebar, my spell situation, like, or, you know, I was so exhausted before I only
5618940	5624620	had levels like one and two. I haven't, nothing's changed about that. You still haven't gotten any
5624620	5632460	spells back. Holy Toledo. You notice the chains around breathy dissolving. If I haven't mentioned
5632460	5638220	that before and testing his arms and legs, he kind of stretches a little bit as the shadow approaches.
5638220	5642620	You can see the shadow. It kind of looks like a black spider. It's got many limbs and as it
5642620	5647580	approaches the ring, you see breathy shift, shapeshift himself or breathy look alike. He's
5647580	5653660	not breathy. You guys spoilers. Anyway, he turns into a great white spider and the two clash. There
5653660	5658540	are many black and white limbs and starling and tangling each other. You can only hear the sound
5658540	5664460	of ripping flesh and tearing limbs from limbs against the dark backdrop or the quiet backdrop
5664460	5669020	of the, you know, the background. Done with that sentence. Maybe this fight will be a hit and
5669020	5680780	they'll push us to mid-season. We've got 13 more episodes. Yeah, so a lifeless corpse of the
5680780	5686700	breathy lookalike falls to the ground and you can see the black spidery shadow rise up in triumph
5686700	5691820	and as it happens, the gray sun gives out a brilliant pulse and then breathy lookalike
5691820	5697180	is dissolved into light and grows or it dissolves into light and flows into the black spidery
5697180	5703100	creature. The black spidery creature walks off to the arena in triumph and takes a place in the
5703100	5707500	stand. What is it? What is this? Oh, Jesus. They get the audience gets to just kill people. Yeah,
5707500	5712460	what do they do? What is the audience doing now? The audience is going nuts.
5712460	5728140	Get in the hole! Get in the hole! Get in the hole! Get in the hole! Especially because of anyone with
5728140	5734220	any attention, they were quiet. This crowd was a quiet crowd in my narration. Yeah. That was very
5734220	5739180	clear. No, yeah. Well, I'm sure though, from their perspective, they're doing that. I mean,
5739660	5742940	yeah, whatever. No. Why am I siding with anyone but you?
5746220	5753500	What's up, y'all? Do the shadow shackles react to any kind of light? Okay, so other than like,
5753500	5757980	you guys can see in the darkness, there's just Sharpie, so he can barely see, but there's not
5757980	5762700	really any light. The only thing that could be considered light. You mean cork, right? Sharpie.
5763980	5767820	I'm human. Yeah, so you can't see in the dark. Everyone else has like low light. Oh, sorry,
5767820	5771980	sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. But I'm human too. Yeah, but you got the goggles of night,
5771980	5776060	which is why you have dark vision. So that's why. Continue. Sorry, I misunderstood. So yeah,
5776060	5780620	other than the dark sun pulsing, there is no real light, but even that was like a dark anti-light.
5782300	5787580	Like a shadow light. Like instead of spreading light, it spreads dark. Yeah. That's also a thing
5787580	5793260	in Dungeons and Dragons. No, I know. I like it. Yeah, I'm just saying. Janine Garofalo must be
5793260	5798940	really popular here. You feel a tug on your chains and you see the chains have detached
5798940	5802940	from the wall and now the nine guards are leading you towards the central ring. Oh, maybe they're
5802940	5809260	going to free us. Yeah, probably. The show's over. It seems like, yeah, I've never seen a movie. They
5809260	5813420	wanted to show us perfect. The guy in front of us. Yeah, we didn't like the guy either. Thanks, guys.
5814620	5819500	Where'd me park? Standing in the center of the ring. I know you didn't really see how they got
5819500	5822940	there, but you see four figures, one of which is markedly shorter than the rest.
5824060	5828060	Okay. Well, you're being wrong. Do you guys validate? I'm still going with the part.
5829660	5833660	I'm still going with that. They pull you into the middle of the ring and you're
5833660	5839180	facing these four fellows that look rather familiar. Oh, it's us. They're us. There are
5839180	5847420	shadow versions of ourselves. Are they our shadows? They are. Where are you fucking kidding me? God
5847500	5852620	damn it. Think of all the tropes. Do they have goatees?
5857580	5863740	And does my guy have multiple number one hits? They're more like spritery colors. It's just
5863740	5871980	lady in blue. It's a tucked in green. They like it over there. I think it's purple is the opposite
5871980	5879580	color, right? All right. No, not purple. Never mind. Green. Okay. So where are we now? You're in
5879580	5885580	the center of the ring facing down your shadow duplicates. Oh, God. You see the guards who dragged
5885580	5889420	you here kind of dispersed and you're no longer around, but you still have bindings around. Oh,
5889420	5893420	it makes sense because Brefi was a spider guy. So now he's, he fought his own version,
5893420	5897660	which was a spider guy. And he got his ass beat for his troubles murdered. Luckily,
5897660	5900620	we're not as strong as giant spiders. So these guys aren't going to be that strong.
5906780	5910780	Do they also have a lot of infighting going on and raping each other when we're asleep?
5913020	5918460	Yeah. Why don't we just hang back and watch them do bits until they die.
5927660	5933580	One of the half Muslim Jewish prison. Why is your shadow taking all of his inventory,
5933580	5935340	tying it into a ball and throwing it around?
5939100	5942940	You just keep fucking a football. Yeah. You're fucking everything. Yeah.
5944540	5949900	You can, uh, you feel the chains around you kind of drop off and they dissolve into mist. And as
5949900	5955180	this happens, you feel refreshed as if, you know, like vitality is coursing through you and new.
5955180	5959340	All right. I'm only going to say this once. Non-conflict resolution. Worth a shot.
5959340	5964860	Worth a shot. Worth a shot. Although we are in an arena with spectators. Yeah.
5964860	5967500	This is probably the situation where that's least going to work.
5969340	5973340	You don't have like baseball games where they're like, you know what, let's just hang out tonight.
5973340	5979820	But it's ourselves. All right. Let's try. I mean, do they move like us? Like, do them,
5979820	5982140	they haven't moved since you've seen them. Well, I will,
5983020	5986940	I will pull out an arrow and see if my shadow moves. It doesn't move.
5986940	5990620	It doesn't. Okay. How do I look? You look great. Not bad.
5991900	5997180	Can I shoot, can I shoot my shadow? Oh, I'm sorry. Are we going to do a non-conflict resolution?
5997180	6003180	I want to communicate. I'm going to step forward holding my hands in a non-violent manner.
6003180	6019020	And I say, guys, you are us. We are you. That means you don't want to do this either.
6021500	6031420	Let's not do it together. And we'll have twice as much a chance as that working of that working.
6033180	6036220	You're probably drunk too.
6041340	6043580	A couple articles and prepositions aren't going to bug you.
6046140	6049180	I wait for your answer. Take all the time you want. I step back.
6049740	6053420	In unison, the four draw their weapons. You're a fucking dick, Spencer.
6053420	6055660	And you were born a dick and you're going to die a dick.
6055660	6065020	You're vindictive and you're petty. And this is why people don't like Dungeons and Dragons.
6065020	6068380	They think of nerds as being like these people with all this
6071660	6077740	anger dwelling inside them. They take it out in these dice and things. Or maybe we should
6077740	6082460	just go out on a football field. Just fuck each other up. Sharpie. That's what you want.
6082540	6086620	If you like pain, if you like discomfort, let's go play football.
6088380	6093660	You know, this is supposed to be about fun. I don't want to die.
6096540	6103580	It's Mother's Day. She loves season four. If I die, she won't even care.
6104860	6108700	She won't notice. She was quoting lines. I wasn't even there.
6108700	6114140	She won't notice. She only knows they exist because of the fucking television.
6114140	6119340	And she's going like, oh, that was a good one. This is like, you know how they do puppet therapy?
6125900	6126780	Episode title.
6131180	6135980	Hey, you're a druid or whatever. What does your druid's dad think of it?
6138700	6144460	What part of your body did the magic missile get cast at?
6148060	6150060	All right. So they've drawn weapons, I guess.
6150060	6152220	I guess this looks like we're going to have to slug it out, right?
6152220	6155340	Did you say earlier we felt suddenly rejuvenated, like we were just reset.
6155340	6160300	Oh, yeah. We've got you. Yeah, I was going to finish saying that. But yeah,
6160300	6163900	all of your spells come back and you guys return to full health.
6163900	6167260	Awesome. So it's going to be seemingly a fair fight.
6167820	6169020	Seemingly. Right.
6169660	6173340	I should remind you, you guys are still weakened from losing your shadows,
6173340	6178060	which has given you, you know, ability damage. Oh, these are our shadows that left.
6178060	6181820	Yeah. You weren't there and that happened.
6181820	6184140	I just put it together. These are our shadows.
6184140	6186780	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Shit.
6188940	6194300	So if they win, they get to go hang out with the rest of society and the stands and watch
6194300	6197820	people get ripped to shreds. And if we win, we get to have them hang out
6197820	6201340	underneath us when we eat ice cream. This is a little one sided.
6202140	6204620	Yeah, it seems like they have a lot more. It's like we've entered a world where
6204620	6208540	people other instead of shadows are completely disregarded and mistreated.
6208540	6210060	Yeah. Huh.
6212380	6217580	In a world invisible the most. That's just deep.
6220140	6222060	We could cut it here if you want.
6222060	6223980	No, no, no. Well, it is five to 10.
6223980	6227820	And we've been saying like we could launch into combat fresh next time.
6227820	6229500	Yeah. It's going to take a while.
6229500	6232620	We didn't really put Denise 10 in any use. Denise, do you want to fire the first shot?
6232620	6236540	You want you want to hell? Yes. Let's let Denise get at least one.
6236540	6241180	Well, if I shoot at the shadows, is anybody here going to take damage from
6241180	6245900	are they in some way linked to the shadows? Because of yes, I would shoot two into his.
6247820	6249180	She points at quark.
6250140	6252700	There's no way of knowing for sure.
6252700	6254860	Okay. I'll shoot two arrows into his shadow.
6256700	6258060	What the fuck? What's going on?
6258780	6260140	You a shadow, not you.
6260140	6263980	I'll remind you that you could shoot three arrows as a result of your speedy longbow.
6263980	6264540	Thank you.
6264540	6266060	Yeah. So three?
6266060	6267100	All right.
6267100	6268460	Wow. So it's Mother's Day, so.
6269980	6270300	What?
6270860	6275740	Anyway, I'm confused sometimes. Okay.
6275820	6281500	Anyway, two of your arrows managed to plant themselves into just the the chestal region,
6281500	6287500	but he doesn't seem to bother. One of them hits him in his exposed shoulder, dealing some damage.
6288460	6289260	Sorry, everybody.
6291420	6292060	Nine damage.
6295260	6295980	But not to me.
6296540	6297500	No, to his shadow.
6297500	6298620	Yeah. So in your face.
6300140	6301580	She didn't want to hurt you.
6301580	6302860	She does. She was trying to hurt you.
6302860	6304540	What if she was prioritizing?
6305260	6308060	What if she was prioritizing the most effective combat?
6308060	6309900	That's what Iranians do. We infiltrate.
6309900	6311100	Fuck Adam Goldberg.
6311100	6311660	That's right.
6312300	6314780	She was prioritizing the most effective combatants.
6314780	6316220	You're the best fighter we have.
6316220	6317580	So she was getting your equipment.
6317580	6320060	She was saying Adam Goldberg asked her to kill my character.
6320060	6320940	She was trying to do it.
6322700	6324220	I like my interpretation better.
6324220	6324860	Oh, yeah.
6324860	6325500	Yeah.
6325500	6326620	I like those better too.
6326620	6331100	At the same time, Shadow Moraine fires off three arrows, two of which also miss,
6331100	6333500	and one of which plants itself into Krista Berg.
6334540	6335420	What?
6335420	6336860	Happy Mother's Day.
6336860	6338140	Dealing four damage.
6338140	6339580	All right. I'm okay with that.
6339580	6340220	All right.
6341580	6343260	What do we... Are we gonna stop now?
6343260	6344300	That's up to you guys.
6344300	6345100	Yeah. Let's stop.
6346540	6348460	The first shots have been blown.
6348460	6350620	Yeah. If it bleeds, we can kill it.
6351500	6353340	I figured out a new way to end the show.
6353900	6354220	Yeah.
6354220	6357260	We review and make sure there's nothing to edit out for real,
6357260	6358940	so that we can upload it quicker.
6361020	6361980	Sounds exhilarating.
6362620	6364860	What did we say that we wanted to edit out?
6364860	6366700	Uh, the, uh, community stuff.
6368300	6368860	What was it?
6368860	6373660	We want to yell out, uh, we want to edit out that guy actually yelling the N-word.
6373660	6376700	Wait. Someone just, someone actually just yelled out the N-word?
6376700	6377180	Yeah.
6377180	6377820	Was it a black guy?
6377820	6378780	Who was it? Who was it?
6378780	6379500	I'm black.
6379500	6380140	It's okay.
6380140	6380860	Oh, you did?
6382860	6385340	Wait. Get up here. Get up here, for fuck's sake.
6385340	6386220	All right.
6386220	6388300	God, just say it for us, would you?
6388380	6391340	Oh, God. We got a Farsi woman to come up and say the C-word.
6391340	6391740	Yeah.
6391740	6392220	All right.
6392220	6393420	What's your name, first of all?
6393420	6393900	Jay-Z.
6393900	6394620	Take the mic.
6394620	6395180	Nigger.
6395180	6395660	All right.
6395660	6399180	Yay!
6401260	6401740	It's fun.
6403740	6404700	They took it back.
6404700	6407180	Thanks for coming to Harbontown, everybody. We did it.
6409180	6410540	Let's hear it one more time for Janice.
6410540	6413020	Thank you so much, Janice, for coming up here.
6416620	6417340	Spencer.
6417660	6418220	Spencer.
6419820	6421180	Kumail Nanjiani.
6421180	6421660	Okay.
6424300	6426060	And everybody else, hear it out. Jay-Z.
6429100	6429500	Jay-Z.
6430700	6431740	We're going to edit out his name.
6431740	6435100	Yeah, yeah. Well, it was already a fake name, right?
6438700	6439900	One more time for Jay-Z.
6439900	6440700	Jason.
6443020	6444140	Jason, I'm a dickhead.
6446940	6448860	I'm Burbank, California.
6448860	6450460	Happy Mother's Day, Jay-Z's mom.
6453260	6454140	I'm Jeff Davis.
6454140	6456700	You're coming to Harbontown one more time for your mayor, Dan Harmon, everybody.
6456700	6469500	Good night.
