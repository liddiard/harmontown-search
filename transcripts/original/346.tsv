0	14600	How are you tonight from the lovely downtown dynasty theater, you feel good?
14600	20640	I'm already so drunk and a little high, you look so damn good, shout out to yourselves,
20640	24520	we don't have a signature critic tonight, give him a round of applause though, he tried,
24520	28480	he was here and he had to go, you know?
28480	35400	We also don't have a Jeff Davis tonight, but we do have me the poor man's Tay-Diggs.
35400	39920	Brandon Johnson, let's get right into it and bring out the mayor of Harman Town, you know
39920	58360	how we get down, Dan Harmon!
58360	68320	Hip to the hop, good stop, hip to the hop, hip to the hop, hip to the hop, don't stop,
68320	73760	spot your mama looking down, put her around, pick her up, took her to, that's the fuck,
73760	74760	hold on.
74760	75760	It's always time for mamas.
75760	90440	Rock to the mic, rock it up, rock it down, wait, wait, no, that's wrong, okay, rock to
90440	96440	the mic, rock it up and down, fuck your mama, fuck that, why do you have to fuck people's,
96440	97440	fuck your mama?
97440	98440	All right, just give me a second.
98440	111440	Hate to the little hat a picnic, catch some food now, that's not gonna work.
111440	114240	All right, cut it, cut it, cut it, it's not gonna work.
114240	119420	I'm neither that talented tonight nor, who are you pointing at?
119420	120420	The disappointment.
120420	125600	Oh, you think he comes here for my rap?
125600	127480	I do.
127480	134440	You were like, I got a pocket square, like I was here for his rapping, no, don't let
134440	136160	him put you on the spot.
136160	139200	You're disappointed that you're here in general.
139200	143760	It's a bad neighborhood, it's Monday night, it's eight o'clock.
143760	145760	Dedicated man, dead dedicated.
145760	150600	You guys are all statistically more likely to die tonight, because you didn't stay at
150600	151840	home.
151840	154800	Was it worth ten dollars?
154800	158080	It might be worth, if they gave you ten dollars.
158080	165240	All right, whatever, what do I got in my notepad?
165240	167240	Let's take a look.
167240	177280	Ah, shit, I'm sorry tonight, I got a little, I got a little drunker than I, I don't usually
177280	183280	come in this drunk, unless we have like a special guest.
183280	186760	We have a special guest tonight, but I mean like usually, I'm like, like Yardley Smith,
186760	190960	I was like, God damn it, Lisa Simpson's coming in, I'm like, bar, bar.
190960	192920	Norman Lear, I'm like, bar, bar.
192920	197640	You know, tonight it was like, it was an accident, tonight I'm like, bar, and our guest is going
197640	198640	to suffer.
198640	199640	All right.
199640	200640	He's been briefed.
200640	203400	Here's a thing I'm convinced that I've wanted to talk about forever.
203400	208520	One car per green each lane.
208520	211800	How is this helping the freeway system?
211800	214120	All right.
214120	222120	You're not confused when you get to that thing, and it says, does it seem at all like you're
222120	225160	in the hands of an infrastructure?
225160	231000	One car per green each lane, what?
231000	236360	Think about it like there's a bunch of faucets at a trough where everybody's washing their
236360	238140	hands, right?
238140	242940	So everybody can get in to each faucet and wash their hands, but if some guy or some
242940	250240	lovely lady comes over and puts his or her hands in your stream, then there's confusion.
250240	256780	So if you can regulate the amount of hands going into each stream, you'll have a smooth
256780	261700	flow.
261700	268980	I'm going to put that in a different way, which is that someone looks at us like insects
268980	276180	from above, and they go, well, if we could just figure out a way to slow this spot, and
276180	283060	instead of them going, we should do our job better, building things.
283060	284060	That's the good thing.
284060	290340	They put a fucking thing that says, you guys should intermittently stop.
290340	291540	That's dumb.
291540	292900	That's stupid.
292900	293980	No one obeys it.
293980	295660	No one knows what the fuck is going on.
295660	297380	It creates tension.
297380	299580	It's like, welcome to the machine.
299580	307460	It's like that Pink Floyd song starts like, welcome here, dear boy, I'm a cigar.
307460	309420	Because it's like, welcome to the freeway.
309420	310420	Don't fuck it.
310420	316740	It feels like when you're a freshman in high school, there's a sign that says one car per
316740	318900	green each lane.
318900	321260	Everyone's trying to muscle each other out.
321260	322260	Everyone's in a hurry.
322260	326340	There's a packed freeway ahead of you, and everyone is pulling up on this thing and looking
326340	331940	at each other like, it just brings up the worst in everybody.
331940	333060	That's what they always do.
333060	337220	They throw the trouble to the people who can't deal with it.
337220	338220	They didn't know.
338220	339220	They make it your problem.
339220	341460	They didn't know we weren't going to share.
341460	342460	Yeah.
342460	345780	No, they knew damn well.
345780	349820	They're just like, well, just put a fucking thing there for the poor people to bump up
349820	350820	against.
351340	352500	It'll slow them down.
352500	353700	That's all it is.
353700	357500	It's like, I'm telling you, it's like something.
357500	367220	Okay, so I think my Adderall doctor is getting cracked down on.
367220	375380	I went to see him snitch today, and he was like, he took my blood pressure, and he listened
375380	380780	to my heart, and then he's like, we're hitting the prescription, and he went, by the way,
381340	384340	who gave you the ADD diagnosis?
384340	387620	I was like, that would be you.
387620	393580	And he made this face that was like, oh.
393580	395380	He was hoping not to hear that.
395380	402060	He was hoping to hear, Sigmund Freud in 1830, absolutely.
402060	407820	Because then his response was like, well, can I give you a questionnaire that the medical
407820	409140	board gave me?
409140	410140	What?
410860	415940	I fully expect next time I go to this doctor, there's going to be boxes in the hallway.
415940	421700	I'm going to drop this questionnaire in the mail to some federal oversight committee that's
421700	426140	like, I promise I have trouble focusing.
426140	427260	I'm telling you.
427260	431980	We will keep our fingers crossed, but that does not sound good.
432020	442020	Well, I guarantee if I go to a professional psychiatrist, I'll bet you a million Adderall tablets.
442020	443020	Oh, shit.
443020	444020	OK, this is why.
444020	446780	Yeah, that's the currency of the future.
446780	448380	No, what the fuck?
448380	451980	Why do you think I want this prescription, because I'm like, I'm stockpiling.
451980	453860	I don't take nearly as many.
453860	456660	This better not get out.
456660	461700	I always trick the doctor into going, well, you need 30 niblets a day or whatever.
462100	463380	The answer is 15.
463380	464860	And then I slowly build up.
464860	471020	It's like a one of those games, like no, no, it's like Clash of Clans junkies.
471020	474060	Don't know junkies don't stockpile.
474060	475060	How dare you.
475180	475740	I'm doing it right.
475740	477060	I'm a prepper.
477060	481340	I'm I'm going to have the currency of the future.
481340	485700	Like when we're all like hip deep in water and like everyone's like in ghillie suits and
485700	489660	we're just like, well, how many bottle caps for that shopping cart?
489660	494460	And I'm going to be like, dude, I got the wakey pills.
494460	498820	Because no, the best thing to do is stay awake during the apocalypse.
498820	499820	Yeah.
499820	503540	Wait, no, no, the best thing to do is sleep.
503540	504540	I'm out.
504540	505540	What's your count?
505540	506540	Oh, well, yeah, OK.
506540	508540	Well, then, yeah, I'm dead in the first round.
508540	512180	You should be stockpiling carbon monoxide.
512180	513740	There's things you should be stockpiling.
513740	514740	I'm not.
514740	515740	That's none of my business.
515740	517340	I intend to go out kicking and screaming.
517340	518340	Really?
518340	519340	Yeah.
519500	520500	Yeah.
521180	522020	Yep.
522020	523380	No, I don't care.
523380	524220	Planet Earth.
524220	527340	I'm going to say this is the best week we're doing right now.
527340	529460	No plumbing and fucking air conditioning.
529460	532180	Can you imagine what we'll do when those things are gone?
532180	532860	Nope.
532860	534180	There'll be no Halloween.
534180	536580	I'm going to do one of those things.
536580	538980	I'm going to assure my pets and my fiance.
538980	539980	I'm going to be like, you're right.
539980	542900	Let's all go out right now.
542900	545500	It's early Steve Levy.
545500	547500	Steve Levy, yeah, a round of applause for Steve Levy,
547500	551100	ladies and gentlemen, Steve Levy.
551100	552060	He took the note.
552060	553940	It was like, you know, Jeff called him out.
553940	556820	It was like, it seems egregious.
556820	560140	I'm going to be one of those controversial guys
560140	560940	in the apocalypse.
560940	565940	I'm going to say, yes, let's all take the cyanide tablet
565940	571180	together, but I'm going to hang out.
571180	574900	What do you, just so I know, what
574900	577580	is the thing that's going to make you be like, fuck this.
577580	578780	I'm not sticking around.
578780	579660	I thought I could.
579660	583220	My intestines getting ripped out by zombie.
583220	583980	No, I'm not.
583980	589140	I'm telling you, I'm leaving this life under protest.
589140	590500	Period.
590500	592220	Because I think that's what God will hate.
596220	598660	I think he designed me for suicide.
598660	603940	I feel like I'm in a vocational category
604660	611580	of like, you know, I'm supposed to fucking, I'm in pain.
611580	615220	No offense to anyone who feels that way.
615220	616900	I don't want your last thought to be like,
616900	620660	Dean Harmon thinks I should like this.
620660	622980	I also want you to talk to someone, et cetera.
622980	628060	But I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm not doing it.
628060	629460	I'm not doing it, man.
629460	631100	I'm doing it.
631100	634900	And I decided that during my bladder infection.
634900	636420	Because I'm like, this hurts.
636420	637660	It hurts to pee.
637660	639020	Yeah.
639020	640020	That'll make you reconsider.
640020	642100	It feels like I got to pee when I don't have to pee.
642100	643740	I'm like, you know what?
643740	644780	I'm sticking around.
647500	650780	All my predecessors, this is when they checked out.
650780	654020	You know, you get a little ache in your thing.
654020	655060	I'm sticking around.
655060	659140	I want to spit in the eye of whatever's left when you've
659140	660780	been reduced to nothing.
660780	663380	I want to be there for that fucking like,
663380	666580	uwatu, the watcher, fucking Marvel character, whatever
666580	669700	the thing that shows up goes like, wah, wah, wah.
669700	671500	Mo, why are you still alive?
671500	673500	Because I wanted to do this.
673500	676100	Whoa, big shot.
676100	678460	Yeah.
678460	679540	I'm going to be that.
679540	681900	I'm going to fucking like, I want to Vasquez
681900	683460	in Aliens with the grenade.
683460	687060	I'm going to be like, I want to look at nobody.
687060	688140	My lover's not left.
688140	691420	I'm just going to like, yeah, hang on to that grenade.
691420	692620	That's ballsy.
692620	693740	Well, it's not ballsy.
693740	695860	It's kind of, it's also sort of a form of cowardice.
695860	698660	I'm like, yeah, I'm going to, you can't drag me out of here.
698660	699940	I'm not doing it.
699940	701700	I'll be dead when I'm dead.
701700	702940	Plenty of time for that.
702940	704020	That shit's dope.
704020	707380	Claiming ownership over your own sort of like,
707380	709100	I'm not leaving is dope.
709100	712780	Me on the other hand, bye motherfucker.
712780	715620	I'm gone at the first sign of some bullshit.
715620	717860	I'm talking about you can't, when you can't get your car,
717900	719460	when you can't get your license plate tags,
719460	720700	I'm fucking out.
723100	725740	All right, somewhere in the middle there, we'll.
727740	731060	All right, well, you know, I'll feel differently tomorrow.
731060	732780	Like I said, I came in a little drunk.
732780	734220	I'm a little numb to the whole thing.
734220	736340	I'm like, man, I'm bulletproof.
736340	739300	I say, give me a blowjob shot.
739300	741980	I don't care, I'm a doomsday prepper.
743180	747180	Okay, look, our next guest,
748060	751740	is an author.
751740	753100	He's got a new book out called,
753100	754460	It Came From Something Awful.
754460	757140	Please welcome Dale Barron.
757140	758340	Dale Barron, everybody.
758340	763340	Or not, you know, he doesn't have to.
766620	768660	Ladies and gentlemen, Dale Barron.
768660	770140	There are no wrong answers.
771300	772220	Hello, sir.
772220	773860	Sit anywhere you like, I think.
774860	778220	People might have opinions about it, but I don't.
778220	780700	Thank you for getting special drunk for me.
780700	782100	Oh, no problem.
782100	783260	I know I'm not special, but.
783260	784100	It's in the show, right?
784100	785900	You only know because I told you.
785900	787740	You're not like, oh god.
787740	788980	I appreciate it.
788980	790060	All right, good.
790060	791740	So I can keep drinking and you won't be like,
791740	792860	oh god, he's, okay.
794100	798500	So your book, it's about the history
798500	801140	of 4chan's last 8chan.
801140	802180	Yes, yeah.
802180	804060	It goes back to the very beginning.
804060	807980	Yeah, it goes from like 2003 when the site 4chan
807980	810100	was founded all the way up to now
810100	813300	when we're in an alt-right terrorist epidemic
813300	816660	that is formed off 8chan until I guess last week
816660	818220	when it got cut off, yeah.
818220	820220	So I thought I was writing about something
820220	823820	like really irrelevant, but like when the book came out
823820	824860	and I was trying to explain to people,
824860	825900	and then like I went on vacation
825900	827820	and there were all these horrible shootings
827820	830980	and like I was on the, like at my beach house,
831340	832220	and I don't have a beach house,
832220	837340	but I was at a B&B and like the owner was like,
837340	839540	oh, the 8chan, they just shut it down, right?
839540	843420	Like everyone now knows the sites and all that, it's.
843420	845260	And I hate to be one of these interviewers,
845260	846900	this is my big pet peeve with interviewers
846900	849740	where they go, what do you say to the people who say?
851580	854140	Because they're just saying like, well, what if,
854140	857420	I'm like, what do you say to the people who say,
858260	863260	shutting down venues for, like making it illegal
865780	869580	for bad people to convene, is that.
869580	870420	Go for it, man.
871420	872260	What do you say to those people?
872260	875220	Yeah, I actually agree that 8chan should be shut down.
875220	877300	I spoke to the founder of 8chan
877300	878900	who also thinks it should be shut down,
878900	880620	I was like one of my sources for the book,
880620	883020	he's like, please shut it down, right?
883020	885140	Just picture this middle aged guy with a comb over,
885140	888300	he's like, I just meant for the kids to have a good time.
888300	889580	If only it were like that.
889580	892020	It was supposed to be twice as much fun as 4chan,
892020	892980	that's the point.
893940	898940	Yeah, no, he's like, yeah, he's like 25,
899100	903020	he's a disability, he's like three feet tall,
903020	903860	and he's in a wheelchair
903860	905580	and he lives in the Philippines, he's a programmer.
905580	906900	Jesus, what?
906900	908940	Yeah, that's the founder of 8chan, yeah.
910460	911300	The founder?
911300	912140	The founder of 8chan, yeah.
912140	912980	But you say he's 25 years old,
912980	914700	he founded it when he was seven?
914940	917340	Yeah, he founded it when he was 20.
917340	922340	So it started in 2013, so I think that's about right, yeah.
923140	925580	Yeah, so maybe he's 27 now, yeah.
925580	928380	Well, I guess I wanted to headline with the whole,
928380	933060	like kind of like, but you're in favor
933060	935540	after all the research that you've done,
935540	938140	you're like, yeah, pull the plug,
938140	941380	but in case that gets people's dander up,
941380	944020	and I don't mean, if it gets your dander up,
944020	946060	you may be a person who like me,
946060	947740	when you hear stories about stuff,
947740	949340	it's like, I don't know, I tend to,
949340	953060	I always skew towards the middle,
953060	955260	where I'm like, wait, that's not gonna help.
955260	957340	Like, don't, you can't make,
957340	959340	you can't make microphones illegal
959340	961700	because you didn't like what someone said into them, right?
961700	963500	Yeah, that's kind of where I started too,
963500	966420	where I was like, oh, it'll just be like the war on terror
966420	968180	and then it'll just spread the fire elsewhere,
968180	972740	which does happen, but 8chan in particular,
972740	976740	it's just so poorly moderated,
976740	979940	that the idea that you're gonna have a place
979940	981820	where you're gonna allow all this legal content
981820	983300	and no one's gonna police it,
984180	987780	the internet, it turns out, it's very hard to run that,
987780	990100	there's a lot of people enabling that,
990100	993460	and when it's gone, it turns out that most of those shooters,
993460	997140	like 19, 20 years old, and that they posted stuff
997140	999500	like the Poway shooter was like,
999500	1000700	oh, I've just been here a year and a half,
1000700	1003020	I've learned so much, she's like 19, right?
1003980	1006780	So it was clear that teenagers are going there,
1006780	1010300	finding the site, getting radicalized by these older losers
1010300	1011900	that have been there for like 10 years
1011900	1013580	and then on 4chan, even longer.
1014980	1019140	So if that's broken up and like they go hide
1019140	1021820	in Discord servers or they go hide in weird places,
1021820	1025020	it's gonna be a lot harder for those teenagers to find it
1025020	1026580	and this to happen.
1026580	1028820	It actually like, when you de-platform it,
1028900	1031540	when you punch Nazis on the street, they do go away.
1031540	1033620	Does that like solve the Nazi problem?
1033620	1036140	No, does it solve those systemic issues?
1036140	1036980	Does it address those?
1036980	1037820	No, but it does help.
1037820	1039060	But how does that survive,
1039060	1042140	truly forgive me in advance for being like this weird,
1042140	1044460	like, but what about or whatever guy?
1044460	1048020	But like, I honestly wanna like,
1048020	1052380	it's, I may be dating myself,
1052380	1057380	where it's like, the internet began as this place
1057780	1059460	that was the Wild West.
1059460	1064460	And the beneficial parts of it were absolutely
1065460	1070460	because of its lack of oversight, censorship.
1071220	1074100	And when we talk about net neutrality,
1074100	1079100	we worry about the idea of corporate psychology
1081300	1085620	creeping into a place that was possibly the bastion
1085620	1090620	of free thought and the ACLU is very sometimes unsavory,
1091820	1095180	but I think admirable kind of stance.
1095180	1098980	It's always like, look, if Nazis wanna get a permit
1098980	1101340	and parade, we have to protect their speech
1101340	1103460	as much as we protect a million man march
1103460	1108340	because we don't care if the quality of the speech
1108340	1110420	that we're protecting, et cetera, et cetera.
1110420	1112100	I'm throwing this shit at you,
1112100	1114300	not because I actually wanna challenge you
1114300	1115860	because I'm 46 and I'm tired
1115860	1119220	and I want all these kids fucking off my lawn.
1119220	1120060	Sure.
1120060	1121940	But I'm actually throwing it at you
1121940	1126020	because I think probably like maybe there's a bell curve
1126020	1129780	of my listeners who I would assume,
1129780	1131940	especially even if they're decent people
1131940	1133260	that they're kind of like skewing towards.
1133260	1134340	Well, wait a minute.
1134340	1137620	What are we pulling the plug on microphones?
1137620	1138460	Right, yeah.
1138460	1140420	So, I mean, there's a few things to parse there
1140420	1142480	where the First Amendment covers
1142480	1144520	the government restricting speech.
1144520	1147280	So when you let the Nazis march in free speech zones
1147280	1148760	and things like that and the ACLU defends them,
1148760	1151600	that's really defending their right
1151600	1153800	through the First Amendment for the government not to do it.
1153800	1157480	It's sort of another story when you are building
1157480	1159560	all of these tools that allow the person
1159560	1160880	to use this message board
1160880	1162120	and then there's another company
1162120	1164080	that creates the DDoS protection
1164080	1166520	and there's another company that runs the servers
1166520	1169960	and all of these creative people have created together
1169960	1173760	this space, their contributions have then created HAN
1173760	1175240	and allow it to thrive.
1175240	1177400	And you're right, the internet was built
1177400	1179800	as this decentralized place where anyone could create
1179800	1182400	a website, anyone can go and put their stuff online.
1183440	1187040	And I guess the internet still allows neo-Nazis to do that.
1187040	1189680	But the other part there is that like,
1189680	1192680	if you have all the stuff that other people built,
1192680	1196160	they don't have some obligation,
1196160	1198160	have their creation used that way.
1198160	1201640	So the fact that Facebook,
1201640	1204440	or the company that does DDoS protection,
1204440	1208400	like attack protection against websites,
1208400	1210040	that they're like, no, right?
1210040	1211120	That to me seems valid,
1211120	1215640	that you don't have a right to use everyone's junk that way,
1215640	1218320	like everyone's creative work that way, so.
1218320	1220560	But Facebook is evil.
1220560	1222080	Yeah, Facebook is also evil, right?
1222080	1224120	They're selling your information, they're profiting,
1224120	1226080	they're a corporate for-profit thing.
1226080	1230880	Yeah, they also have a lot of terrible problems.
1230880	1234000	I can't believe I'm accidentally like,
1234000	1236000	but what abouting on behalf of this thing?
1236000	1238960	But that's the thing is that I feel like,
1238960	1242520	I feel personally like the thing that's scooting me off
1242520	1247520	out of this arena is precisely because transparency is dead,
1248760	1252280	vulnerability is dead, freedom is dead,
1252280	1256560	visibility is nothing but a liability, et cetera, et cetera.
1256560	1259600	And it's partially like every bone in my body
1259600	1264600	wants to rumble the brigands and firebrands
1266760	1269320	that have rumbled me for instance.
1269320	1272120	They don't like who I am as a visible person
1272120	1275920	and to the extent that they are they, they coordinate,
1275920	1279160	they reveal that nine years ago I fucked a baby
1279160	1282160	in a comedy sketch, boom, boom, he should be fired.
1283160	1284920	A fake baby.
1284920	1287160	Yeah, a fake baby, the doll baby, yeah.
1287160	1288680	Also made love to it.
1288680	1291640	Those guys, I mean they.
1291640	1295480	But it's AT&T that almost fired me
1295480	1299840	and it's also partially people that you could call liberal
1299840	1302200	that were like, oh, I didn't know that,
1302200	1305080	he should be canceled, his life should be ruined.
1305080	1309400	And it's almost like I got rumbled by these guys
1309480	1314080	and by these guys I mean like this knot of that internet
1314080	1319080	and I'm like, I'm like, well, that's the shadow I cast
1319320	1323760	when I was 27 and I thought like them and felt like them
1323760	1325800	and aren't they just kind of coming back to haunt me
1325800	1329600	and saying, you were like us, don't fucking high road us,
1329600	1331720	don't do waiting wongs with Jessica Gao,
1331720	1334400	don't you dare, how dare you make Rick and Morty
1334400	1336960	and like say that it's not okay to be racist,
1336960	1339920	we're gonna fucking out you and like rumble you.
1339920	1343920	And I was sort of like, touche, I'm done.
1343920	1347400	And I don't like them, but at the same time,
1347400	1352400	I will never advocate for, it's hard when I hear this,
1356040	1360320	it's like, oh shit, we're gonna, we shut this area down.
1360320	1363600	But I'm sorry, I'm babbling all this shit at you
1363840	1366840	and I don't mean to be overly contentious.
1366840	1370080	No, I love it because I want,
1370080	1372160	because you wrote a whole fucking book about this
1372160	1374160	and you went back to the roots.
1374160	1377080	We had a conflict journalist on the previous episode.
1377080	1380920	Yeah, and like I read some of his shit and I was like,
1380920	1382760	God damn, that's a compelling case.
1382760	1385160	And I think it's when you start to contextualize it
1385160	1386880	in terms of like global politics,
1386880	1390880	you start to think about it like, if this were ISIS,
1390960	1393920	that's when you start to, like your mind starts to go.
1393920	1398920	If we knew about a network on our internet
1399400	1403120	that was radicalizing youth, et cetera, et cetera.
1403120	1404200	Yeah, so, right.
1404200	1406360	So I think you're kind of extending them
1406360	1408560	a little too much credit, I guess.
1408560	1410440	I don't know that you were them.
1410440	1411560	This is a different breed of individual.
1411560	1413040	Yeah, I think that.
1413040	1416200	At 27, your mindset was not, were these cats?
1416200	1419720	Well, I only wanna say this to be perfectly fair.
1419800	1424800	Like, things that I said in text at the age of 27,
1432520	1435440	we didn't have the same words for it that we have today.
1436360	1441360	But I was a young man that prided himself
1441760	1444920	on seeing beyond the grand illusion.
1444920	1448360	Yeah, but you weren't looking for a racial mentor.
1448360	1449920	You weren't looking for a racist
1449920	1454200	that could sort of help solidify
1454200	1458240	that you had been correct in your thoughts about society.
1458240	1459920	Certainly would have drawn the line there.
1459920	1460760	Right, but I think also.
1460760	1462920	But that's because I was talented.
1462920	1465360	But that's a big difference.
1465360	1468400	Yeah, that is a big difference between you and them, yeah.
1468400	1470440	That's surely my biggest,
1470440	1474120	this is why I don't truck with white supremacists
1474120	1476800	because they're fucking obviously untalented.
1476800	1479080	Why would they be proud of the color of their skin?
1479080	1482560	Which is also why they want a platform built for them,
1482560	1483400	right, where like.
1483400	1484920	So take us back to 2014,
1484920	1487320	because I think that's the thing.
1487320	1488320	Wait, did you read?
1488320	1489640	Did you, did you, did you, wait.
1489640	1490480	We'll do a little research.
1490480	1491320	All right, okay, all right.
1491320	1494160	Just in case, just in case, buddy.
1494160	1496320	Just in case you needed me.
1496320	1497720	2014 is sort of the start,
1497720	1499840	and you have the lineage broken down.
1499840	1501200	If you can get us there quickly,
1501200	1502960	because I think that answers some of what you're asking.
1502960	1505080	Well, no, yeah, no, I wanted, sorry,
1505080	1506520	I just wanna say this at the beginning.
1507160	1508560	The reason I threw all this shit at you
1508560	1510920	is because I eventually,
1510920	1514520	you're gonna take us from the root to the leaves.
1514520	1517520	And I didn't want anybody out there
1517520	1519560	to have a resistant read to it.
1519560	1522120	I wanted them to lower their arms and go like,
1522120	1525440	look, okay, so we're just being objective.
1525440	1528720	And obviously, no one writes a book about this shit
1528720	1532440	without diving deep and opening themselves up to it.
1532440	1533880	And I just didn't want,
1533880	1536960	there's, I just, I didn't want to,
1536960	1538960	I didn't want anybody out there to be like,
1538960	1543520	ah, but I'm Han Solo, so why should I buy into this?
1543520	1545040	That's it, so.
1545040	1547640	Yeah, I mean, if, imagine something
1547640	1549880	where the creator himself is like,
1549880	1551440	this needs to be destroyed, right?
1551440	1554240	Like, that's sort of where we are with this debate,
1554240	1558800	where it's, I mean, it's just like you create anything,
1558800	1560960	right, you make art, and like, if the art's bad,
1560960	1562280	no one has the right, you know, like,
1563080	1563920	everyone has to pay attention,
1563920	1565680	there's someone else has to promote it, right?
1565680	1567360	It's like, the right to promotion
1567360	1568880	is what they're asking for.
1568880	1572280	Where like, you can put your Nazi garbage up on a website,
1572280	1573920	no one's preventing you from doing that,
1573920	1577120	but all of the stuff that it takes to create
1577120	1579480	something like HN, which loses a ton of money.
1579480	1581520	It's just there as a vanity project.
1581520	1583800	Who makes money off of this sort of speech?
1583800	1586280	Like, who makes money off these sites?
1586280	1588400	HN loses a lot of money, and it's just there,
1588400	1590560	there's like a crazy businessman in the Philippines
1590560	1594000	who just adores it, and his son also is an avid HN user,
1594000	1595440	that's why he owns the site.
1595440	1597800	How much do you think they lose?
1597800	1600920	It's not sure, I didn't actually get that number out,
1600920	1603320	but I know that it's probably in the thousands of dollars,
1603320	1606680	so he's kind of like, he just loves
1606680	1608840	making that kind of material.
1608840	1609680	Wow.
1609680	1613280	Yeah, so that's the other issue, that, yeah,
1613280	1615840	there's been many times where people have tried
1615840	1618400	to create these sites, and they've just flopped,
1618400	1619760	and so now we have this weird scenario
1619760	1623600	where HN was just this one weird guy
1623600	1626000	who fell into a great deal of money,
1627280	1630080	yeah, and now runs up until last week.
1630080	1632200	But what if we were to, so take us back,
1632200	1636360	because your book is called, it came from something awful.
1636360	1638040	All right, you wanna do the sweep?
1638040	1638880	Yeah.
1638880	1640440	Yeah, I mean, if you don't want to.
1640440	1642240	Sure, no, no, no, let's do it.
1642240	1646240	So the nutshell sweep is that in 2003
1646720	1650680	was the start of 4chan, and it was really out of
1650680	1654120	the sort of nihilist, 90s nihilist sort of slacker culture,
1654120	1656360	which was another site called Something Awful,
1656360	1658520	where that sort of humor, where you're dropping out of life,
1658520	1660520	you're like, I don't care about politics, whatever,
1660520	1661840	I'm gonna just sort of have this race
1661840	1664040	to the bottom of transgressive humor,
1664040	1666200	and it's gonna be worse and worse and worse.
1666200	1669280	And that site got so kind of dark and cynical
1669280	1671960	that it had a spin-off, which was 4chan,
1671960	1673600	and 4chan had even less moderation,
1673600	1675200	it was started by like a 15-year-old kid
1675200	1678080	who was into anime, and he combined that,
1678080	1681600	he copied a site in Japan called 2channel,
1681600	1684160	and 2channel was really dedicated to otaku culture,
1684160	1686480	so this idea of like, I'm just gonna drop out,
1686480	1688520	I'm not gonna climb the hierarchy of success,
1688520	1690600	I'm not gonna go to school, it's too hard,
1690600	1692560	I'm not gonna have a job, I'm gonna just hang out
1692560	1694320	and consume fantasy products all day.
1694320	1695520	Tyler Durden.
1696800	1698400	Yeah, like.
1698400	1700720	Or anything, Pepe the Frog, like anything.
1700720	1702760	Like Tyler Durden, there was definitely like
1702760	1705160	a Fight Club thing where everything's just like,
1706000	1710040	any popular icon, like things that are appealing to people
1710040	1711800	are people that like unplug and go like,
1711800	1713320	whatever the fuck, Big Lebowski,
1713320	1716280	like, well, hey man, give me a white Russia.
1716280	1718240	Yeah, I feel like in the 90s there was just this sense
1718240	1720800	of ennui, where people were like, nothing's gonna,
1720800	1723360	we're just sort of like unhappy, we gotta like,
1723360	1724200	we're not gonna do anything.
1724200	1725560	That was the alternative comedy movement,
1725560	1728520	to people who are, who are among,
1728520	1731760	who are my honored colleagues, Sarah Silverman,
1731760	1735760	Janine Graffalo, David Cross, like alternative comedians,
1735760	1739400	who began as actually just like thrusting their hands
1739400	1742600	in their pockets and going like, I know one thing,
1742600	1745320	I sure the fuck am not Judy Tanuda.
1745320	1746160	Right.
1746160	1748480	Like, I'm not Tim Allen, that's for sure.
1748480	1750800	And now, like we're the exact opposite part
1750800	1753560	where youth culture is like, they're like,
1753560	1755600	we're gonna have a socialist revolution
1755600	1757720	and Pikachu is gonna lead it or whatever, right?
1757720	1759400	Like that's like youth culture where they're like,
1759400	1762160	you got Waluigi out there fighting the Proud Boys, right?
1762160	1765680	So that, that, how do we get from there
1765680	1767800	is through this, these websites.
1767800	1768640	Right.
1768640	1773640	So, so up until 2007, 4chan becomes wildly popular.
1774280	1776040	It is where memes come from.
1776040	1777840	That's where they invented memes
1777840	1780160	and they sort of invented these trolling collectives of like.
1780160	1781640	Probably most importantly though,
1781640	1784400	it's because it's the anonymity culture, right?
1784400	1785240	Yeah.
1785240	1789240	There's no way to know on 4chan
1789240	1793760	who you are, like it's, it's just rampant, carnival,
1793760	1797200	like in a world that where you can do that anywhere,
1797200	1799680	but it's like 4chan almost like,
1799680	1802040	you can't go onto 4chan and go, hey, it's me,
1802040	1805360	you know me, Mr. Clean, like you can't,
1805360	1806840	you can't create an identity.
1806840	1808560	You can, but it was like looked down upon,
1808560	1810080	but yeah, it was almost all anonymous.
1810080	1811240	So it was just default.
1811240	1813080	The name that you put in the box was anonymous.
1813080	1814200	That's what the software displayed.
1814200	1816360	So everyone was anonymous and it was self-deleting content.
1816360	1819080	It was super fast, frenetic, sort of like that.
1819160	1820960	The Facebook feed before the Facebook feed
1820960	1822040	where it's just churning through
1822040	1824800	the sort of most popular commented upon comments
1824800	1827920	and that sort of like weird ecosystem generated memes.
1827920	1830880	So anything was interesting or gross
1830880	1833360	or the most insane stuff popped to the top
1833360	1835040	and it was just this constant flow.
1835040	1837920	So that was like what the youth culture was about.
1837920	1839840	Do you think that's because it's easier to show an image
1839840	1841200	than to be clever?
1842440	1843480	That was part of it.
1843480	1845120	It was definitely like a competition
1845120	1846840	to be weird, gross and funny.
1846840	1847920	That's really what it was.
1848560	1851200	The founder of Something Awful described it to me.
1851200	1853760	He's like, everyone was competing there
1853760	1855560	to be the most fucked up piece of shit possible
1855560	1857240	and they were all winning, right?
1857240	1858520	That was the competition.
1858520	1860080	Would you look at the movies from back then,
1860080	1862320	Pump Up the Volume, Heathers.
1862320	1863920	I'm talking to you, Christian Slater.
1863920	1868320	I really want to pin the blame squarely on Heathers.
1868320	1870000	I really just want to put it there.
1870000	1871240	Breakfast Club, everything.
1871240	1873800	Christian Slater's like kill yourself, kill everyone else.
1873800	1876120	Good message to the kids.
1876120	1877800	There was this heroism, denialism.
1878640	1880840	It was like, smash whatever you can.
1882520	1886720	I remember being like 13 and my brother,
1886720	1889600	who was no fucking hero in the neighborhood,
1890600	1895600	marveling at what he called the Beastie Boys generation
1895960	1898160	as he looked at me and my 13 year old friends.
1898160	1901280	We were like behaving the way we were in a mall
1901280	1904200	because I think we had gotten some impulse in our head
1904200	1906840	from watching Weird Science and Breakfast Club
1906880	1908640	and all these things that we were like,
1908640	1912600	your job as a hero is to hack culture.
1912600	1914440	Everything around you is horseshit.
1914440	1916880	John Hughes told me so.
1916880	1920120	If it has a logo on it, then it's garbage.
1920120	1923240	And to the extent that I smash it, I am a hero.
1923240	1925400	Right, so that's what I kind of go over in the book
1925400	1928200	where the crazy thing about that is that that was new
1928200	1929600	and we still have it today,
1929600	1932160	but it started in the 80s and then the 90s
1932160	1934880	and sort of got worse and worse as entertainment culture
1934880	1937440	and marketing culture just expanded, right?
1937440	1940000	So in the 60s, youth culture was about like
1940000	1942120	socialist revolution where we're back to today
1942120	1944840	and they're about like, they had like sincere politics
1944840	1946880	and they were gonna change the world.
1946880	1949360	And then by the time we reached the 90s,
1949360	1952040	it's like we're in this psychic garbage dump.
1952040	1954320	The psychic garbage dump is like full
1954320	1956080	of all of these different marketers
1956080	1958000	and all these products and all this pop culture
1958000	1959680	and we're just like skimming in the bits
1959680	1961200	and it's represented on the internet
1961200	1963280	and we're gonna like cobble it back together into memes
1963280	1964520	and that's gonna be our culture
1965040	1967520	and we're just gonna drop out because it's so hopeless.
1967520	1970640	So that's where it was and then it totally flipped
1970640	1975200	in like 2008 and fortune birthed anonymous,
1975200	1977640	the hacker collective and they're like,
1977640	1981000	oh, we're so powerful, we're so many young men,
1981000	1982960	like hundreds, thousands of people,
1982960	1985720	all collectivized online, we should have a lot of power.
1985720	1988280	Like we created memes, that was powerful.
1988280	1991240	We can intimidate people as hackers and troll armies,
1991240	1993080	that's powerful and they said, well, oh,
1993080	1994200	we have these things that we believe in,
1994760	1996880	we believe in libertarian internet freedom.
1996880	2000000	We're anti-corporation, we're anti-church of Scientology
2000000	2003840	and suddenly they became this like cogent political movement.
2003840	2006600	So the opposite happened and like they're protesting
2006600	2009600	on the streets and I'm like going to the protests
2009600	2012320	and it's like the raids that they have online,
2012320	2015560	they're addressed as the same cartoon characters.
2015560	2020080	I wanna pause there because you said they flipped in 2008
2020080	2022560	and I wanna be clear about what you mean.
2022880	2025840	They flipped maybe from towing the line
2025840	2028320	that you would automatically assume
2028320	2029800	and maybe people are outraged,
2029800	2033080	like how could they possibly be Nazis?
2033080	2036280	They flipped to conservative is what you mean.
2036280	2038120	No, no, no, no, no.
2038120	2039040	What did they flip to?
2039040	2041920	They flipped from dropped out nihilism
2041920	2043480	to political activism.
2043480	2044920	So they were on the left then.
2044920	2047160	Oh, so they flipped from Alanis Morissette
2047160	2049600	having one hand in her pocket and the other flashing
2049600	2052840	a peace sign to both hands manipulating
2052840	2054480	the political scene.
2054480	2057040	Yeah, one on the computer right in the glow
2057040	2057880	of the green screen.
2057880	2058720	They're like, okay, we're.
2058720	2062120	I think Alanis Morissette is the best vessel
2062120	2063640	to understand this.
2063640	2065600	I'm just trying to like.
2065600	2066520	Which is ironic.
2066520	2069360	Yeah, I'm just trying to put her in the, yeah, right.
2069360	2071200	Finally, finally we found something.
2071200	2072040	Which is.
2072040	2073840	It took a long, it took us 20 years.
2073840	2074960	The fact that it's ironic?
2074960	2075800	Yeah, but now we're here.
2075800	2076640	He's ironic.
2076640	2077480	Finally got there, man.
2077480	2078960	Holy shit, Alanis.
2079040	2080440	I hope you're listening.
2080440	2082240	So like, yeah, like.
2082240	2083440	Ironic convergence.
2083440	2087960	Yeah, so, you know, like last week
2087960	2090560	when Waluigi is fighting the Proud Boys or whatever,
2090560	2092360	like two days ago when he's got the anonymous mask
2092360	2096040	on, the Guy Fox mask, which is like from a comic book,
2096040	2097480	which is from a movie.
2097480	2099880	But the movie is about anti-fascism
2099880	2102320	and political activism and right.
2102320	2104320	So they took all that pop culture stuff,
2104320	2105720	movies and comics and they're like,
2105720	2107120	oh, this is real, this is sincere.
2107120	2108320	We're not ironic anymore.
2108520	2109800	We can do this, we're a lobbying group.
2109800	2112880	It's sort of like, it's not unlike Baby Boomers going like,
2112880	2114240	oh, we're silver foxes.
2114240	2116000	Let's do this.
2116000	2120640	I, so 2008, you're looking at, there's this pivot point
2120640	2123920	because that's probably what the Tom Cruise thing happens
2123920	2125560	with the anonymous, like.
2125560	2126400	That's the moment.
2126400	2129840	Taking down Scientology is such an obvious bad guy.
2129840	2132480	And it's sort of like that dopamine rush of like,
2132480	2133720	oh my God.
2133720	2136000	But then I've seen documentaries where it's like,
2136000	2138320	well, it's almost like the Weathermen or the,
2139800	2142200	it's like any kind of like activist group,
2142200	2145720	like the people that were involved in that,
2145720	2148320	you have no way of knowing they vanish
2148320	2151000	and then there's people who take their place who are like,
2151000	2153560	and then that I am not your personal army
2153560	2155720	kind of thing starts where it's like,
2155720	2158440	because it's like, oh, we have this power.
2158440	2161440	Let's use it to make this girl kill herself.
2161440	2163000	Because she's a slut.
2163000	2165960	And then people go like, what, that's,
2165960	2169560	how does that equate with our battle with Scientology?
2169560	2170920	Yeah, that was the huge problem
2170920	2174120	of making a decentralized group, right?
2174120	2177000	Where anyone could say, oh, that's us.
2177000	2179320	And it was that trolling sensibility
2179320	2182360	where the boards were still full of nihilists
2182360	2183280	and they broke.
2183280	2184680	So there was like a big split.
2184680	2186720	So half of them were like, no, we're gonna have,
2186720	2188800	we're gonna be real political actors.
2188800	2191640	We're gonna fight for democracy in the Arab Spring.
2191640	2193840	And then the other half were like, no, we're trolls still.
2193840	2198840	And we want to still do obnoxious things like hack forums.
2198840	2202000	So hack an epilepsy forum with flashing gifs
2202000	2203840	so everyone has a seizure, right?
2203840	2205440	That was what they did to say,
2205440	2206920	to sort of fight back against the image
2206920	2210280	that they're hacktivists.
2210280	2212200	So yeah, there was a big split there.
2212200	2215800	But the anonymous hacktivist collective
2215800	2217800	actually goes on for the next few years
2217800	2220160	and they defend Julian Assange and all this stuff.
2220160	2223240	But then the FBI just arrests all the principal members.
2223240	2227360	They go after all of them and most of them went to jail
2227360	2228600	and that's the end of the movement.
2228600	2231160	And then we get the moment that you're waiting for
2231160	2232920	where after that happens,
2232920	2235480	then the boards are like ultra nihilistic.
2235480	2237360	The losers are, they've been there
2237360	2238920	for like six or seven years.
2238920	2242360	New kids are coming in and then they flip to the right.
2242360	2244520	That's like the movement that,
2244520	2246400	that's the movement towards the right.
2246400	2249560	And that's because like those sort of dynamics
2249560	2252080	where really it's,
2253240	2255720	you have less and less opportunities
2255720	2258120	for kids to have fulfilling jobs,
2258120	2259720	to move out of their parents,
2259720	2261520	have like adequate housing,
2261520	2263440	have access to education.
2263440	2266320	That's getting worse after the 2008 crash.
2266320	2268520	And then on the other half,
2268520	2270280	you have expanding screen worlds,
2270280	2272400	expanding entertainment products.
2272400	2273800	You can just live forever in the video games.
2273800	2276840	And like society makes it really easy to do that.
2276840	2279120	They're like, you wanna play Mario Maker 2 all day?
2280120	2283240	And that's a libertarian world.
2283240	2284920	The guy who created the Silk Road
2284920	2287000	was a passionate libertarian.
2287000	2290280	Libertarianism ironically is like
2290280	2293080	a closer cousin to conservatism
2293080	2296160	because you want no oversight.
2296160	2297440	You want no regulation.
2297440	2299400	You want the free market to figure it out.
2299400	2301640	And that makes a hell of a lot of sense
2301640	2304480	if your parents turn out to be way the fuck wrong
2304480	2306760	about you being good at Mario Brothers,
2306760	2309400	not leading you making a lot of money.
2309400	2313120	Yeah, and this world kind of like says to them,
2313120	2315200	like mounting student debt.
2315200	2319800	And also they're riding this wave of like,
2319800	2321800	it's too many Facebook posts
2321800	2323920	about affirmative action gone wrong,
2323920	2327880	about things like everything that's click worthy
2327880	2331360	is like about the world's gone sour.
2331360	2332400	Right.
2332400	2336360	All of these dreams of the Voting Rights Act
2336360	2337200	and all of these things,
2337200	2340160	oh, it's political correctness has gone mad.
2340160	2344400	There's nothing fun for a 15-year-old about going like,
2344400	2345240	that was the other thing.
2345240	2347560	Yeah, but here's the thing, littering's bad.
2347560	2348400	Yeah.
2348400	2350360	Like that's not what a 15-year-old does.
2350360	2352760	Yeah, and that I cover in my book as well
2352760	2355880	where like the same time that's happening,
2355880	2360880	Tumblr, which is the majority all female image sharing site
2361400	2365600	that's sort of like a female version of 4chan except Nice.
2367120	2370040	It is developing a new sort of set of leftist politics,
2370040	2372240	which is full of feminist critical theory,
2372240	2375200	but it's also a very rigid in its structure.
2375200	2377560	And it's for very many valid reasons.
2377560	2379560	It's based around this idea that like, okay,
2379560	2382400	there's cis white males at the top of this power pyramid.
2382400	2385680	And then the idea of politics is lift everyone up
2385680	2388320	to that same level, all the other minority groups.
2388320	2392800	And then you have this vast group of men on the margins,
2392800	2394520	young men on the margins at 4chan.
2394520	2396840	And they're like, we are the oppressed ones, right?
2396840	2398200	We are losers.
2398200	2399480	And they're furious at that.
2399480	2401760	Then they want to abandon the left for that reason.
2401760	2402800	And of course, like you're saying,
2402800	2405320	like it's very polite that culture.
2405320	2407880	So they sort of agree upon a moral value system
2407880	2409320	and they all sort of append it.
2409320	2410200	And then they say, that's it.
2410200	2412200	That's the moral system that we're gonna have.
2412200	2416160	And 4chan as trolls and like young men who wanted to offend,
2416160	2419300	they were like really delighted in trolling that culture,
2419300	2421600	being the outsider and sort of steering into the skid,
2421600	2423280	being like, all right, if I'm the loser,
2423280	2425120	I'm gonna be like the best loser.
2425120	2426800	They're like, right, or the worst loser.
2426800	2429160	You don't have, do you have a chapter in your book
2429160	2432880	about Tumblr being a bag of shit?
2432880	2436720	Like I, I'm, I do not, that's not what it's called.
2436720	2438400	We do not want a society based on Tumblr.
2438400	2442120	I fled that as quickly as I fled Twitter.
2442120	2444000	I heavily critique Tumblr.
2444000	2445720	Yeah, I have three.
2445720	2449840	If 4chan considers Tumblr the girls camp across the lake
2449840	2451200	and they're going on panty raids,
2451200	2452640	which is basically what's happening,
2452800	2454160	it's just juvenile behavior.
2454160	2456920	We're gonna, we're gonna do a DNS attack
2456920	2459040	and fucking this chicks a cat and all this shit.
2459040	2461000	It's just like, it's just children.
2461000	2463320	And I've been abused by both of them.
2463320	2464960	I shake my cane at all of them.
2464960	2468280	I go, you're young, I'll be on Instagram for some reason.
2468280	2472080	I'm just showing myself swimming in my pool.
2472080	2473280	Yeah, so you're like, right.
2473280	2475400	It's kind of inherently, you're like, oh, it's just kids.
2475400	2478380	But like the weird thing is that Tumblr's politics
2478380	2481080	then got imported into leftist politics.
2481080	2483480	And then 4chan's politics got imported into the right.
2483480	2485360	And it's like those, all of those ideas
2485360	2487360	that like incubate it there,
2487360	2489440	then those kids grew up, they're a few years older
2489440	2491120	and they just, now they're everywhere, right?
2491120	2492880	So it's like, God, they're feeding into each other.
2492880	2494680	And it's sort of the bottom line
2494680	2496560	is sort of more of an anthropological one,
2496560	2500160	which is that children are communicating faster.
2500160	2503480	Like they're speaking a language we don't understand.
2503480	2506360	That's what drives me away from the whole thing is like,
2506360	2508720	I don't get you kids anymore.
2508720	2511000	I don't get when you really mean it.
2511820	2515160	There's three faces with tears coming out of your eyes.
2515160	2518420	Like, do you mean you hate me?
2520720	2523560	Why can't you understand my dryness?
2523560	2527160	Like I'll go, like I'll say in all due friendship
2527160	2531140	to somebody on Instagram, like I'll kind of,
2531140	2534920	I'll give what I consider to be like a kind of like,
2534920	2537240	I'm a middle-aged man and like somebody will like
2538160	2541800	jab me a little bit, like a juvenile kind of jab,
2541800	2544680	and I'll do what I think is like the right thing to do,
2544680	2548080	which is jab them back a little harder,
2548080	2550880	but be like, like, don't be fucking like,
2550880	2552720	and then they'll go like, dude, chill,
2552720	2554240	what the fuck's wrong with you?
2554240	2555840	I'm gonna sue you.
2555840	2558240	And then I'm like, what the fuck's wrong with all of you?
2558240	2559080	Ah, yeah!
2561200	2563920	There's no, I'm afraid of young people.
2564760	2567040	Sure, well, they should be afraid.
2567680	2569640	And the young people are afraid of each other.
2569640	2570480	Yeah, they're deeply afraid, yeah.
2570480	2573600	It is such a classic, it's Tumblr versus Fortune.
2573600	2576360	Yes, you're exactly right, that I say in my book
2576360	2578640	it's based on fear, that's the fundamental value,
2578640	2579880	that they're all powerless, right?
2579880	2582880	But I'll say, I mean, in case anyone wants to know,
2582880	2586040	I'm not both side-zing it,
2586040	2589480	because my tenure on Tumblr,
2589480	2594480	like, the result of it is an inbox full of vulnerable,
2600840	2605120	honest, like, people who, like,
2605120	2607560	if I start talking about it, I'll cry,
2607560	2612040	because I can't pile through the messaging
2612040	2614080	of people reaching out to me,
2614080	2617120	and letting me know personal things, and.
2617120	2618680	And then Fortune's like, I'm coming to your house,
2618840	2620200	I'm gonna mutilate you with a scalpel.
2620200	2622960	I mean, they're, yeah, they're like, yeah,
2622960	2627160	it's because on the other side, it's all about identity.
2627160	2628000	Right, yeah.
2628000	2630960	And it's that phrase, identity politics keeps coming up.
2630960	2633760	Yeah, so the way that I critique Tumblr in my book
2633760	2637040	is that I think that the sites themselves,
2637040	2642040	Tumblr and social media, is based around self-obsession,
2642320	2644640	that you're putting all this stuff up,
2644640	2646320	and you're creating this hall of mirrors
2646320	2647600	where you're, like, looking at all the selfies,
2647600	2650600	and you're like, what, selfie best reflects my lifestyle?
2650600	2652360	And that's what it, it's very addictive,
2652360	2653840	that's why it exists in the first place,
2653840	2655360	because they want you to keep going back,
2655360	2658800	but then the politics then reflects that obsession
2658800	2662080	with cultivating your identity and yourself.
2662080	2665600	So it really comes from, like, some asshole at the top,
2665600	2667760	who's just like, I'm raking it in, right?
2667760	2671160	There's some key here where it's like, I swear,
2672920	2676160	it fuses with Joseph Campbell, where it,
2676160	2681160	because the ornamentation of ritual and stuff,
2681200	2686200	like, when anonymity becomes a culture,
2686200	2689400	and it's carnival, and it's like, wait a minute,
2689400	2691080	how many days have we been doing this?
2691080	2694160	Like, are you a bird man?
2694160	2696400	That's, like, allowed to rape me,
2696400	2698400	or are you my fucking banker?
2698400	2699400	Like, like, what, if it has to be run.
2699400	2702160	I don't understand that question, but I,
2702160	2703360	Let me break it down for you.
2703360	2705800	I want to. Are you a bird man?
2706800	2709800	I'm learning this from my tour of Venice.
2709800	2711800	It is the best question I've ever got.
2711800	2713800	They're a description of carnival culture.
2713800	2715800	It starts with, like, there was this thing
2715800	2717800	that the royalty was like, oh, it started with, like,
2717800	2719800	a kind of a let them eat cake thing,
2719800	2721800	and let's all have a Halloween party,
2721800	2723800	and then it grew and grew and grew,
2723800	2725800	because people were finding more and more,
2725800	2729800	this is a great, healthy outlet for me to be who I really am.
2729800	2732800	And by who I really am, I mean, who I really am not.
2732800	2735800	And so that's a commentary on either A,
2735800	2737800	society is not allowing me to be who I am,
2737800	2740800	but in any case, isn't it like that moment
2740800	2743800	in To Kill a Mockingbird where, you know,
2743800	2745800	Atticus steps out in the porch,
2745800	2746800	he looks at these guys in the hoods,
2746800	2750800	and he goes, hey, Clay Simmons,
2750800	2753800	I bought bird feed from your house the other day.
2753800	2756800	Hey, John Goldberg, there probably wasn't
2756800	2758800	John Goldberg in To Kill a Mockingbird.
2758800	2766800	This is my Dan Harmon revised To Kill a Mockingbird.
2766800	2770800	Light is a disinfectant.
2770800	2772800	Yes.
2772800	2775800	Anonymity is a fucking problem.
2775800	2777800	And yet, so is fame culture.
2777800	2778800	Yeah.
2778800	2781800	There are two ends of the spectrum where people go like,
2781800	2785800	if I can brand myself and people can understand who I am,
2785800	2786800	it's me, Daphne.
2786800	2787800	Yes.
2787800	2790800	And I represent only the best things in the world.
2790800	2791800	Yeah, that's the right dance.
2791800	2793800	And my eating disorder will be in the background,
2793800	2795800	and I always think, and then you have the Tyler Durden
2795800	2797800	in Stinky News who goes like, Daphne is full of shit.
2797800	2798800	There's no flake.
2798800	2799800	She's a hall of mirrors.
2799800	2802800	But in order to express that, you don't yourself go,
2802800	2804800	my name's Tyler Durden.
2804800	2805800	It's on my birth certificate.
2805800	2807800	I risk my identity.
2807800	2809800	I choose to call you out, Daphne.
2809800	2811800	What you do is you put on a ski mask,
2811800	2813800	and you throw apples at her house.
2813800	2814800	Yeah, ski mask solution.
2814800	2816800	And I'm thinking like, you two are monsters, both of them.
2816800	2818800	You're the shadows that you cast.
2818800	2821800	Like, what is my point?
2821800	2822800	I don't know.
2822800	2823800	I don't know.
2823800	2824800	You got the dialectic right.
2824800	2826800	I think that anonymity is...
2826800	2827800	Yeah, they're both awful.
2827800	2828800	Yeah.
2828800	2831800	Something requires something there.
2831800	2832800	Yeah.
2832800	2836800	The idea that, and I swear to God,
2836800	2840800	I want to repeat again, the shit that ever happened to me
2840800	2843800	when I got rumbled by these droogs,
2843800	2845800	I deserve every scrap of it.
2845800	2847800	Like, you hear me, guys?
2847800	2848800	I am not complaining.
2848800	2850800	I don't know about that.
2850800	2853800	But I want to say, in terms of dialectic,
2853800	2858800	like, if you have to remain anonymous
2858800	2860800	in order to accomplish your goals,
2860800	2864800	we have a tradition in our culture with those people.
2864800	2868800	Like, we are pretty sure that those people are saying,
2868800	2871800	one, I don't believe in a representative democracy.
2872800	2877800	We are being fooled by our migration to online
2877800	2882800	into thinking that we don't matter as people.
2882800	2885800	And it's almost like...
2885800	2887800	I'm sorry if this is a crass metaphor,
2887800	2891800	but it's almost like the entire internet basically says to us,
2891800	2895800	you're automatically in a hood when you log on.
2895800	2898800	And it's your choice how much you want to roll it up
2898800	2901800	and show your face, and the people that choose to do that
2901800	2904800	are influencers, and they're dishonest.
2904800	2908800	But if you do nothing, if you exhibit no effort at all,
2908800	2909800	you're in a hood.
2909800	2914800	Now, people in hoods, they do bad things.
2914800	2919800	They do things that they wouldn't be actually willing to do
2919800	2922800	if their job was on the line,
2922800	2925800	if their mother's love was on the line.
2926800	2931800	So you're right that the anonymity of 4chan
2931800	2934800	created a really toxic environment, and really no one...
2934800	2935800	Sorry about that.
2935800	2937800	No one had really done anything like that,
2937800	2939800	allowed it to fester like that before.
2939800	2942800	And you're right that when people are anonymous,
2942800	2944800	they treat each other like total garbage.
2944800	2945800	They do garbage things.
2945800	2947800	They know there's no consequences.
2947800	2949800	But at the same time, the other side,
2949800	2951800	where there were all these corporations who were like,
2951800	2955800	oh, well, it's very addictive to replicate the ego online
2955800	2957800	and enchant people through this hall of mirrors
2957800	2960800	where they're constantly looking at their self-image.
2960800	2963800	And so then you get this vast population of young people
2963800	2965800	who are interested in doing that
2965800	2967800	and build the whole culture around it.
2967800	2970800	And so anonymous and 4chan culture was like,
2970800	2973800	we are built around raiding corporate online spaces,
2973800	2976800	breaking them apart, breaking apart the fantasy.
2976800	2979800	Oh, you think you're going to be a wonderful dwarf in Second Life?
2979800	2981800	Well, I'm going to go in there and ruin the whole experience for you
2981800	2984800	because you're under a delusion, right?
2984800	2986800	Hate to say it, yeah.
2986800	2992800	That aligns ironically with the transgender movement.
2992800	2994800	Like online where you go like,
2994800	2997800	I am allowed to be proud of myself.
2997800	2999800	I would be outnumbered at work.
2999800	3001800	I'd be outnumbered at school.
3001800	3003800	I'd be outnumbered everywhere I went in real life.
3003800	3008800	But online, I'm able to actually access other people that are telling me,
3008800	3011800	I too feel the way you feel.
3011800	3012800	You are not alone.
3012800	3013800	You are not outnumbered.
3013800	3015800	You'll never win a district.
3015800	3019800	There's no way for us to take over a fucking section of a city.
3019800	3020800	Right.
3020800	3022800	But here, here you are.
3022800	3026800	It's like the internet is lowering shamed walls.
3026800	3029800	And that includes four Nazis.
3029800	3030800	Yeah, that's very true.
3030800	3032800	Yeah. So I mean, I write about this in the book
3032800	3035800	where there's lots of positive ways where if you're trans or if you're gay
3035800	3037800	and then you can meet other folks.
3037800	3039800	That's where people described it that way.
3039800	3041800	The internet in the 90s,
3041800	3045800	it was like a breath of fresh air that they could actually do that.
3045800	3048800	But the flip side, of course, is that you get groups,
3048800	3050800	you get a group think that if everyone wants to get there,
3050800	3052800	I'll get together and they're like, I love suicide.
3052800	3054800	You're like, oh, I love suicide too.
3054800	3055800	And they're like, that's great.
3055800	3057800	We should all think about how we're going to kill ourselves
3057800	3060800	or how we're going to get like so thin that we're going to be anorexic.
3060800	3065800	And that happened on 4chan as well with the incels and so forth
3065800	3068800	that they got together and they're like, I'm such an otaku.
3068800	3070800	I'm so doomed.
3070800	3075800	I think that I'm born to be on 4chan for my entire life
3075800	3078800	and never go outside only like look at anime.
3078800	3079800	That's just inherently who I am.
3079800	3082800	And then the rest of them were just convincing them that they're like exactly right.
3082800	3083800	Yeah.
3083800	3089800	And so that generated like this weird group think
3089800	3094800	and it got even worse and out of that culture grew the alt-right.
3095800	3099800	It's crazy because they say this is also what causes addiction is loneliness
3099800	3101800	and these people were very lonely.
3101800	3102800	Oh, yeah.
3102800	3105800	But some of these people deserve to be lonely.
3105800	3106800	Yeah.
3106800	3111800	I mean, you could say that like I also like to mock them
3111800	3114800	and I don't particularly like a lot of them.
3114800	3115800	Yeah.
3115800	3121800	I only have a dislike because I think that they don't value skills
3121800	3123800	that we all have to hone.
3123800	3124800	Yeah.
3124800	3128800	I mean, that's that's the other thing that like it's kind of like the
3128800	3131800	you know, like my first job out of college was teaching middle school
3131800	3133800	and there was like the one kid that got bullied
3133800	3136800	and like then he just became an asshole because.
3136800	3137800	Yeah.
3137800	3138800	Right.
3138800	3139800	Because he's like, I'm going to own it.
3139800	3140800	Right.
3140800	3141800	He's like, that's my recourse.
3141800	3142800	That's what I'm going to be.
3142800	3143800	Or he was an asshole and we all knew.
3143800	3144800	Yeah.
3144800	3145800	Yeah.
3145800	3146800	Yeah.
3146800	3149800	Honestly, there have been kids that you learn you stand up for him
3149800	3151800	and then as you turn to them before somebody punches them,
3151800	3153800	you're like, huh, I got your back.
3153800	3154800	And they're like, thanks nigger.
3154800	3156800	And you're like, Oh my God.
3156800	3158800	Oh, that's why people bully you.
3158800	3159800	Right.
3159800	3160800	Yeah.
3160800	3161800	Yeah.
3161800	3162800	Yeah.
3162800	3163800	Right.
3163800	3164800	So, and I do.
3164800	3166800	It kills me every time you say that word, Brandon.
3166800	3167800	Sorry buddy.
3167800	3169800	I just love it.
3169800	3170800	Oh my God.
3170800	3171800	I love hearing it.
3171800	3173800	I'm so sorry.
3173800	3175800	You know, I can't say it anymore.
3175800	3176800	You can say it.
3176800	3177800	Even as a joke.
3177800	3178800	I just loved it.
3178800	3180800	Maybe to you, maybe in a tent.
3180800	3185800	If we go to Utah, I could like take you to a national park and whisper in
3185800	3189800	your ear through an encrypted walking talking Brandon.
3189800	3191800	What can I say one more time?
3191800	3193800	Go ahead friend.
3193800	3197800	I let you for your birthday.
3197800	3202800	You know, the N word is like lingerie for special occasions.
3202800	3203800	Maybe you standing next to me.
3203800	3208800	We had a concert and I look over and I'm like, you can sing along baby.
3208800	3210800	It's special tonight.
3210800	3216800	Is your friendship with your black friend failing that spark spruce it up
3216800	3218800	with this beautiful N word.
3218800	3224800	I just, the hard R boosts your irreverence.
3224800	3227800	My black friends are cheating me, man.
3227800	3228800	Yeah.
3228800	3230800	No, that was part of the deal.
3230800	3231800	It's part of the deal.
3231800	3234800	You get a pork chop recipe and you get to say the N word.
3234800	3242800	Let's talk about you, the person your experience is a researcher.
3242800	3244800	That's very interesting.
3244800	3249800	How long ago does this journey start that ends with you writing this book?
3249800	3254800	I found 4chan very early on.
3254800	3259800	Maybe like 2004 I started my career doing web comics and they were
3260800	3261800	linking in my site.
3261800	3264800	I saw that in the referral logs that they were linking my comic.
3264800	3267800	So I kind of found them that way and I knew about something awful.
3267800	3271800	And then they were at my local anime convention in Baltimore and I thought,
3271800	3272800	yeah.
3272800	3273800	And then they were just like nerds, right?
3273800	3274800	In costume.
3274800	3275800	They were just losers in costume.
3275800	3276800	What do you mean they?
3276800	3278800	How do you, how do you know that they're there?
3278800	3279800	That was the only place they would meet.
3279800	3283800	They would have a 4chan meetup and they would like sing memes and stuff and
3283800	3285800	like, that's literally,
3285800	3287800	God, that's so delightfully nerdy.
3287800	3288800	Yeah.
3288800	3289800	Like the one,
3289800	3292800	one year they sang the Fresh Prince of Bel Air theme song in the rounds,
3292800	3293800	right?
3293800	3294800	That was like what they would do, right?
3294800	3296800	They started the way we all did.
3296800	3297800	Yeah.
3297800	3298800	Yeah, exactly.
3298800	3300800	Like it was that same nerdy culture, right?
3300800	3303800	Like of like, uh, yeah, but it was crazy.
3303800	3305800	Origami became hating black people.
3305800	3306800	I love that.
3306800	3307800	Yeah, exactly.
3307800	3308800	Like how do you get?
3308800	3309800	Yeah, right.
3309800	3310800	So how do you, how do you distinguish yourself?
3310800	3311800	And they're not right there.
3311800	3312800	They're just nerds back then.
3312800	3313800	And they're like,
3313800	3315800	we were trying to replicate what's on the screen.
3315800	3316800	Sure.
3316800	3320800	So, um, so I knew about them then and I was like, this is crazy.
3320800	3323800	And then I saw that it was expanding and it was inventing all this stuff
3323800	3325800	that like just had this huge impact on culture.
3325800	3328800	Uh, and then I tried to report on them in 2008.
3328800	3331800	I went to their, to the anonymous, uh, meeting,
3331800	3334800	like when they went and intimidated church of Scientology and did the
3334800	3337800	protest, I still couldn't figure it out.
3337800	3338800	Um, and then,
3338800	3340800	Well, let me pause you there.
3340800	3341800	So in this,
3341800	3344800	so you're leading up to the peak because I've seen the documentaries and up
3344800	3346800	till now we're talking about heroes here.
3346800	3348800	So were you writing that wave?
3348800	3350800	You're like, these are great.
3350800	3352800	This is a great thing.
3352800	3353800	Yeah. I, I,
3353800	3355800	I thought they were pretty inspiring that,
3355800	3358800	that they would at least kind of have agency over their life.
3358800	3359800	It was hacker culture.
3359800	3360800	Yeah.
3360800	3361800	It's like, I want to be a Linux guy.
3361800	3364800	I don't want to use a fucking PC or a Mac.
3364800	3368800	I want to throw my mouse in the garbage and have fingerless gloves.
3368800	3369800	Like, you know,
3369800	3372800	like between the like,
3372800	3374800	let's just like drop out and kill each other.
3374800	3376800	Youth culture that I grew up in, right?
3376800	3377800	Where you're like, whatever.
3377800	3378800	It's just like,
3378800	3380800	we're just watching TV all day and like, um, making shitty jokes.
3380800	3382800	Like that changing into like,
3382800	3384800	we're going to destroy MasterCard, right?
3384800	3386800	Like that, that idea.
3386800	3387800	I was like, Oh, that's,
3387800	3390800	I'm glad that they're sort of finding some political agency.
3390800	3391800	Um, still.
3391800	3392800	Yeah.
3392800	3393800	Cause that sounds awesome.
3393800	3394800	Yeah.
3394800	3395800	Yeah.
3395800	3396800	Just the name says,
3396800	3397800	destroy me.
3397800	3398800	Right. Um,
3398800	3401800	but I, I kind of w I was doing comics still and stuff like that,
3401800	3402800	but I wanted to be a writer.
3402800	3404800	So I was like, Oh, I'll write on them.
3404800	3406800	But I still didn't understand what the hell was happening.
3406800	3411800	Um, and I kind of like, um, I went on, did other works.
3411800	3416800	So the last work that I did before the fortune book, uh, was I was doing car.
3416800	3418800	I did it like a pilot for cartoon network.
3418800	3419800	I was doing like cartoons and stuff.
3419800	3422800	So I was like, Oh, that'll be, uh, you know, I'll do that side.
3422800	3425800	But by 2016,
3425800	3427800	they started popping it back in the news.
3427800	3430800	They were intimidating the art scene across the country,
3430800	3431800	but also in Baltimore.
3431800	3433800	So like my friends were getting harassed by four Chan.
3433800	3437800	And I was like, Oh, um, uh, this was in the wake of the ghost ship fire.
3437800	3439800	I don't even remember if you'd like there.
3439800	3441800	There was one of these sort of show spaces that caught on fire.
3441800	3445800	Um, uh, and it was like a fire hazard.
3445800	3446800	A lot of folks in San Francisco.
3446800	3447800	I think so.
3447800	3448800	Right.
3448800	3449800	And this guy had had a bunch of spaces.
3449800	3450800	Yeah.
3450800	3452800	We've been doing it for a really long time and something went wrong.
3452800	3453800	Yeah.
3453800	3455800	And, um, four Chan decided at that point,
3455800	3457800	well, like, Oh, will we hate people on the left?
3457800	3459800	We hate young people that are kind of like us that are happy and out
3459800	3460800	partying.
3460800	3462800	And they had already moved to the right.
3462800	3464800	And they're like, let's do this all over the nation.
3464800	3467800	Let's intimidate these people with the show spaces.
3467800	3470800	So I was like, Oh, this is a, this is a, yeah.
3470800	3474800	I mean, just, yeah, awful stuff, but no, go ahead.
3474800	3475800	Keep talking.
3475800	3478800	I'm just like, at that point I was like trying to explain it to my
3478800	3479800	friends.
3479800	3481800	I was like, no, they were nerds who were like singing the fresh
3481800	3482800	Prince of Bel Air theme song.
3482800	3484800	Like 10 years ago that like, it was like, so I was like, all right,
3484800	3485800	I'll write it up.
3485800	3487800	And I kind of thought, uh, you know, a few people would read it or
3487800	3488800	whatever.
3488800	3489800	I pitched to the magazines.
3489800	3490800	They said no.
3490800	3492800	And then I self published it on medium and like millions of people read
3492800	3493800	it.
3493800	3495800	They're like, everyone was like, you know, baby boomers were like, what
3495800	3496800	the hell?
3496800	3500800	Like, because at that point, uh, Richard Spencer had been punched by
3500800	3505800	Antifa with a peppy, the frog pin, which is the four Chan symbol of
3505800	3506800	loser.
3506800	3510800	Trump had tweeted himself as Pepe, the frog, and people are like, what
3510800	3511800	the hell is happening?
3511800	3514800	So that article at least was one of the first ones.
3514800	3517800	There probably would have been other people that would have rushed to
3517800	3520800	fill that void, but I just accidentally happened to be first.
3520800	3526800	Um, and then, uh, I became, uh, doomed to, to write the book where, uh,
3526800	3527800	people were like, well, now we need a book.
3527800	3528800	You can sell the book.
3528800	3532800	Um, and then it was kind of like, you know, it was like, you know,
3532800	3533800	that you go into the book, you know, the book.
3533800	3534800	Now you're entering the book now in your book.
3534800	3537800	And then it was kind of like, it was like those science fiction movies
3537800	3540800	where like, it's kind of like the trope.
3540800	3541800	Or like, they're like, there's the mystery zone.
3541800	3543800	And I'm like, like, we're going to attend a bunch of Marines in like
3543800	3544800	they're not coming back.
3544800	3548800	But like, then like, then, you know, the one comes back and he's like,
3548800	3549800	all fucked up like that's me.
3549800	3551800	Like, they didn't expect me to come back.
3551800	3552800	Right?
3552800	3554800	They're like, like the contract was like, you know, if you don't make it
3554800	3556800	you just, you gotta, you got to give the money back.
3556800	3557800	Right?
3557800	3561800	So I want to circle back to the, oh,India Brandon, you got to, well, I
3561800	3564280	Well, I want to circle back to the Pepe the Frog thing
3564280	3569240	because I believe you're shooting a documentary
3569240	3571000	and you need those sound bites.
3571000	3572000	Oh, yeah.
3572000	3574520	But I didn't value that.
3574520	3575080	It's not me.
3575080	3576080	Yeah, they're for that.
3576080	3577400	No, because that documentary needs to happen
3577400	3579160	because that's a fucking fascinating story.
3579160	3581440	But I'm also fascinated by this different,
3581440	3585520	I just want to lower this fucking Enola Gay
3585520	3590360	bombshell of a question because of what has just happened,
3590360	3596680	which is, OK, so we see what the movement was in Portland.
3596680	3598440	As far as I understand it, and again,
3598440	3602680	as I always say on this podcast, if I know about it,
3602680	3605040	it's gotten through a million miles of gravel
3605040	3608760	because my sole purpose is to avoid the world.
3608760	3611040	But what I understand is what happened
3611040	3617560	is that the unfortunately named Proud Boys, which is literally
3617560	3619760	what I call my dogs.
3619760	3622400	Only because I just want them to be happy.
3622400	3627080	I just feel like they need encouragement.
3627080	3629800	But I'm so conflicted every time I call them.
3629800	3634040	And I go, good boys, Proud Boys, they made doo-doo.
3634040	3635080	And I'm so proud for that.
3635080	3637160	Are they Nazis?
3637160	3638000	None of the Nazis.
3638000	3641040	Their actual stated movement, which
3641040	3644280	you got to give props to the Hank Aaron calling
3644280	3648200	the fucking bleachers, they're like, we're going to do the thing.
3648200	3650960	What I saw in the news was they're like,
3650960	3656720	we're going to have a parade that's themed.
3656720	3661840	And Tifa should be a terrorist group, which throws down
3661840	3665720	this ridiculous passive-aggressive child
3665720	3669760	super nanny episode gauntlet, which is like,
3669760	3670960	what are you going to do?
3670960	3673080	Show up and prove us right?
3673080	3676400	Or not show up and let us run rampant through the streets.
3676400	3681160	So my question to you is, which is like the big Monty Python
3681160	3684240	like 20-ton question, is in a world
3684240	3688360	where now the president of the United States
3688360	3692680	is like down to talk about classification of terrorist
3692680	3695840	groups based on amorphous ideology.
3695840	3701640	Because as far as I know, Antifa means against fascism.
3701640	3706000	And I really would prefer to live in a world where that's not
3706000	3710240	terrorism, however, hey, I'm just chilling in my pool.
3712640	3717720	In a world where that is like, does that affect your,
3717720	3721160	because it's like, aren't, I don't want to say aren't we,
3721160	3724840	it's like isn't the same thing to say
3724840	3728240	that this section of the garden hose of information
3728240	3733640	that is 8chan, like, oh, that's evil, that's a terrorist cell.
3733640	3738000	And I don't mean to make light of that observation,
3738000	3741560	because god damn it, the fucking links are more severe
3741560	3745360	than if any of these people were brown or Islamic.
3745360	3748800	I mean, that's when you start to compare the shit,
3748800	3755160	it's like that's what it all gets black and white, as comparisons are.
3755160	3759920	But it's like, but I'm saying like, it's like, are we move,
3759920	3765440	aren't we all just, don't we just keep moving forward into civil war?
3765440	3766400	Isn't that what we're doing?
3766400	3769240	And is that just what we're doing?
3769240	3772360	You're asking me to predict if there will be a civil war in the United States.
3772360	3778400	Well, I'm saying like, is our ideology like, 8chan's evil,
3778400	3780160	it should be shut down.
3780160	3785600	Is that the same thing as the president of the United States saying,
3786080	3791680	the word antifa, which means if you show up with a homemade gas mask
3791680	3794680	and throw a fucking rock at a Nazi,
3794680	3797320	like now all of a sudden you're associated with them,
3797320	3803040	like, they want that 8chan to be illegal too.
3803040	3804760	They want to pull the plug on that.
3804760	3808560	They want you to be a terrorist instead of just a kid that threw a rock.
3808560	3813280	Right, so I think the answer here is that I do think that unless
3813280	3818040	the systemic problems which create fascism go away or addressed,
3818040	3819440	this will continue.
3819440	3821920	So I mean, it really begs the question like, what is fascism,
3821920	3824120	which I go over in the book.
3824120	3829080	But essentially, when you look at it, the people that analyzed it in the 30s,
3829080	3834120	there was this combination of vast groups of people who were disenfranchised.
3834120	3836520	Hannah Arendt, who wrote The Origins of Totalitarianism,
3836520	3840920	called them de-classed, right?
3840920	3843600	So they're without context.
3843600	3846640	They don't have a job through these sort of throes of capitalism.
3846640	3848800	And so totally de-contest.
3848800	3850120	They're rocked by multiculturalism.
3850120	3855400	So they search for identity and the last refuge they hit upon is their whiteness.
3855400	3857720	And yeah, and then they imagine they also have this other fantasy
3857720	3860320	where they're like, society is falling apart.
3860320	3862520	And just like, I'm dissipated and my personal crisis...
3862520	3863440	I'm Cinderella.
3863440	3866080	There's a reason I don't have a glass slipper.
3866080	3868880	Yeah, so like, right.
3868880	3870000	I actually don't understand what you're saying, but...
3870080	3872280	I was trying to understand you. I didn't want to stop you.
3872280	3873760	I was going to say right anyway.
3873760	3876000	It's why don't I have a glass slipper?
3876000	3877680	I'm Cinderella.
3877680	3879600	I thought it was... I wasn't trying to slow you down.
3879600	3883280	No, no, no. So yeah.
3883280	3885480	Now I'm trying to work in the Cinderella industry.
3885480	3888360	No, don't, don't, don't. No, I was just going like...
3888360	3892040	I'm like the lady in the church going like, hallelujah.
3892040	3894640	I was just backing you up. I was trying to support you.
3894640	3896720	So yeah, so they are the anti...
3896720	3898880	They're not getting the glass slippers, right?
3898880	3900680	Yeah, so they're like, why not me?
3900680	3903040	So they find context in whiteness,
3903040	3906120	which is like the last thing that they can do.
3906120	3906960	And then they imagine...
3906960	3907920	Because they're not talented.
3907920	3909040	Right, yeah. So they're...
3909040	3910240	And they don't have friends and they're like,
3910240	3913160	oh, my whiteness gives me context and it gives me identity.
3913160	3914640	And then the other thing they do is they're like,
3914640	3916080	well, why am I in the bottom?
3916080	3918760	So they have... And if you don't really read a lot,
3918760	3921240	if you don't think a lot, then sort of the default ideology
3921240	3923440	is a sort of social Darwinist idea
3923440	3925000	that life is the zero sum game.
3925000	3928720	It's this cruel hierarchy where there's a few people on the top
3929040	3931400	and I'm on the bottom and I have to climb my way to the top,
3931400	3933960	just like sort of like a cruel, competitive businessman.
3933960	3935120	Which is capitalism's fault.
3935120	3937320	Yes, right. It's the capitalist ideology, right?
3937320	3939600	Right. It's not just capitalists.
3939600	3941520	Minorities fault, too,
3941520	3943680	for they occupy the space that they should have.
3943680	3945080	Yeah, that's the next step, right.
3945080	3947640	For Indians, I'm tired of you blaming minorities
3947640	3948640	for everything.
3948640	3951480	Right. So once you've got that picture in your head
3951480	3952320	and you're like...
3954600	3956720	I'm sorry for my friend.
3956720	3958000	Don't apologize.
3958000	3959480	He's a little racist.
3961880	3962720	Pretty big.
3965440	3966600	But this is a profound thing.
3966600	3970200	There's a finer line between capitalism and fascism.
3970200	3972120	There always has been.
3972120	3974760	Because both things say,
3974760	3977920	if you do your work down here,
3977920	3980880	you can overtake your shitty-ass boss.
3980880	3982840	Right. Fascism says,
3982840	3985560	if you watch your shitty-ass boss long enough,
3985560	3989320	he's gonna slip up and you can slit his fucking throat.
3989320	3992600	Isn't that also what capitalism says?
3992600	3994320	Depending on who you ask.
3994320	3996160	It is...
3996160	3998880	I understand the conflation.
3998880	4001360	I get it. However, I'm here to tell you,
4001360	4003400	capitalism better.
4004680	4005880	All right, I agree.
4005880	4008000	But man, it's because you're rich.
4008000	4009840	And I'm like, touche.
4009840	4011320	Yes.
4011320	4014080	Both suffer from the flaw of scarcity.
4014240	4018000	So, yeah, then the next step is imagining,
4018000	4019320	oh, well, the minorities at the top,
4019320	4021760	they've usurped that place that's for me.
4021760	4024560	And the goal then of politics is to displace them,
4024560	4027960	put them at the bottom through violence or whatever.
4027960	4031640	So that's sort of the rough picture of how it happens.
4031640	4033720	And then, of course, we see that exactly the same
4033720	4036160	with the incel communities with these men on 4chan.
4036160	4038560	The exact same dynamics are happening.
4038560	4041680	So you have a group D class, totally marginalized group.
4041680	4043840	They have a fantasy of becoming the breadwinner,
4043920	4045560	becoming the middle class.
4045560	4047680	And you see that in the shooters where they're like,
4047680	4050320	oh, that's kind of what I imagine will happen
4050320	4053600	after we kill everyone and create a fascist state.
4053600	4056120	And they imagine that, oh, their personal crisis
4056120	4058480	of dissolution where they're on the internet all day,
4058480	4061600	surfing pornography, that's like the nation in general.
4061600	4063920	And they're like, oh, well, the minorities
4063920	4065000	that are coming over the border
4065000	4066960	and the whole nation is disintegrating,
4066960	4068480	just like I'm disintegrating, right?
4068480	4069440	That's their image.
4069440	4074080	Also, they really did make themselves poor black teens.
4074080	4076000	Yeah, exactly right, right.
4076000	4077960	There's this point in America where white people
4077960	4080800	started to make themselves minorities.
4080800	4083920	So they were like, hey, we also have these issues.
4083920	4085600	There's drug use in our communities.
4085600	4087480	We're poor, we're not working.
4087480	4090040	We are just, we're suffering just like they are.
4090040	4091880	And we want the same route.
4091880	4093640	It's a weird race to wanna win.
4094600	4096320	Yeah, no, continue, sorry.
4096320	4098000	Why do I keep ruining my own show?
4099000	4100320	I'm just a fan.
4100320	4102640	I like hearing you guys.
4102640	4104480	And we want the same route,
4104480	4106960	we want the same route to excellence that they get.
4106960	4110120	So we want grants, we want special privileges,
4110120	4110960	we want neighborhood.
4110960	4112960	It's a fucking poetic irony, man.
4112960	4117560	I just started listening to this more perfect podcast
4117560	4119560	brought to you by Radiolab or whatever.
4119560	4123000	It's just like, on paper, it couldn't be more boring.
4123000	4124360	Like, oh, we're just gonna talk about
4124360	4126000	the Supreme Court decisions.
4126000	4127920	And I'm just like, so addicted to it.
4127920	4131120	Because it is, like, it makes you realize,
4131120	4134200	like, goddamn, the national psyche,
4134200	4137680	like, oh, we're just, we're embroiled in this shit.
4137680	4139600	And of course we all know that as individuals.
4139600	4141160	You walk down the sidewalk every day
4141160	4143200	and you have all these unresolved issues
4143200	4144400	that you won't cop to.
4144400	4145760	And the reason you won't cop to them
4145760	4148840	is because, thank God, you don't have to cop to them.
4148840	4152200	You can put off those thoughts for another day.
4152200	4153400	Because what's your job?
4153400	4154880	Well, you need to graduate from college.
4154880	4155880	They need to get a job.
4156640	4157480	You need to make money.
4157480	4161080	You gotta all these level ups you need to do
4161080	4164040	before you get to finally pronounce to everybody,
4164040	4166880	here's the truth about the color of my skin
4166880	4170160	and the shape of my brain and the shape of my brain.
4170160	4171000	Like, like.
4172200	4173200	I'm not at that level yet.
4173200	4174880	I'm not at brain shape level.
4175880	4176880	I'm working my way up.
4176880	4178440	You square brain mother fucker.
4180240	4182800	It's gonna be a sick shape though when I get there.
4182800	4184360	You guys are gonna be excited.
4185360	4188520	There is a crazy, yeah, whatever.
4188520	4190760	I'm not gonna fucking dance playing
4190760	4193240	the Supreme Court history to everybody.
4193240	4194120	Why not, please?
4194120	4196160	I would recommend listening to this podcast
4196160	4198840	because it is like cast like a crazy,
4198840	4203760	the civil rights movement was entirely based
4203760	4205560	in the judicial branch.
4205560	4210040	And it was absolutely because, which I didn't realize,
4210160	4215160	it was like you go through all of these black history heroes
4215560	4217960	and things and you go, well, then this person,
4217960	4219600	they appealed this case and all these things
4219600	4221640	and you don't realize the overwhelming theme
4221640	4223200	is the judicial branch.
4223200	4226680	And then you realize that part of our nation's history
4226680	4229480	is actually people who are going, hey, whoa,
4229480	4232220	the judicial branch shouldn't be this much in charge
4232220	4234040	of the fate of our country.
4234040	4236520	That there were key points where people are like,
4236520	4239720	whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on here?
4240360	4241200	We're not supposed to be able to,
4241200	4243000	we should just sit here in our robes
4243000	4246080	and say whether this guy robbed a grocery store or not.
4246080	4248920	Right, too much a slate from the bench.
4248920	4252320	Like there was a key point when it turned
4252320	4254880	into a different thing and became, yeah, anyways,
4254880	4257000	my name's Dan Harmon, my podcast is bad.
4257000	4262000	You're crushing it, what's to come?
4262120	4262960	What's to come?
4262960	4266200	Oh, lord, sweat it out, buddy.
4266200	4267800	What do we got?
4267800	4269720	What's to come, you piece of shit?
4269720	4272160	Yeah, that's where, yeah.
4272160	4274880	Have we driven them into a space where it's harder
4274880	4277200	to monitor now that we've put clamps down?
4277200	4281120	Or were they never really that scary to begin with
4281120	4282900	and they kind of hyped themselves?
4284000	4286960	I mean, they were a real threat and it's true that,
4286960	4289120	yeah, when A-chan's gone, they're just gonna scatter
4289120	4290320	to other places.
4291320	4295000	But I do think there's kind of cause for some hope here,
4295000	4298680	which is that they're all teenagers or kids or men
4298680	4300720	with the adolescent mindset of boys.
4300720	4303280	That means they're kind of very mercurial, very variable.
4303280	4305720	They have an identity crisis inherent in who they are.
4305720	4307120	And they're just getting hooked on Buffy reruns.
4307120	4309240	Yeah, well, that's where they started.
4309240	4310480	That's where they started, right?
4310480	4312160	And they're like 10 years of Buffy reruns,
4312160	4314120	I have to retry them and then they're groping around
4314120	4316160	and they're like, fascism, that'll fix it.
4317760	4320440	Yeah, I'm really trying to land in a place
4320440	4323200	where I understand this because I don't,
4323200	4325760	I can like go through the rest of the chronology.
4325760	4329600	I feel like we kind of like hit around 2012,
4329600	4334600	and like we got Gamergate in 2014 and then the Trump stuff.
4335120	4336160	I'm cool that you're going through
4336160	4337360	the rest of that timeline,
4337360	4340000	but I'm always gonna have this key issue,
4340000	4343760	which has to do with like, I'm always gonna be that guy
4343760	4347240	until I see the light, which, by the way,
4347240	4349080	I'm also a big Second Amendment guy,
4349080	4351360	which none of my listeners would agree with.
4352360	4354440	I have all kinds of contradictions.
4354440	4357040	The way that I think about it is that like,
4357040	4359240	if we're getting closer to fascism,
4359240	4362440	do you want less guns on the street?
4362440	4365480	I want all kinds of things,
4365480	4367880	but I don't wanna be in control of the Constitution.
4367880	4370760	I want people who tell me to tie my shoes
4370760	4372120	to burst into flames.
4372120	4372960	Sure.
4372960	4373800	That's not my right.
4373800	4376160	Like I don't want that to be my right.
4376160	4381160	I don't, I'm very uncomfortable
4381600	4386600	with anything that mitigates, like just people.
4386760	4388240	Oh, like constitutional.
4388240	4391160	I just don't, it's very difficult for me
4391160	4393680	when it gets to this point where we're talking about,
4393680	4397080	and part of it is me dating myself to an age
4397080	4400200	when the internet is just a ham radio.
4400200	4401920	It's just a bunch of nerds going,
4401920	4403560	can you hear me, can you hear me?
4403560	4406560	And maybe what I need to understand about it
4406560	4409320	is that this is how all of us communicate now,
4409320	4412560	but I almost feel like that makes the case stronger
4412560	4416760	in my mind that kids need a pool hall to hang out in.
4416760	4421120	And if they're being racist and sexist and murderous
4421120	4425480	and horrible, and if every kid that does a mass shooting,
4425480	4430200	even if literally every single one of them can trace,
4430200	4434520	can be traced to have hung out at one pool hall,
4434720	4439400	I definitely am willing to spend tax money
4439400	4441480	on the FBI investigating that pool hall.
4441480	4442320	Right, sure.
4442320	4443560	Because I want to know if that pool hall
4443560	4447960	is engaging in something,
4447960	4452400	is engaging in anything other than freedom.
4452400	4453840	Because you want to save those kids.
4453840	4458240	Well, I want to, no, fuck those kids.
4458240	4460640	No, I can't wait for those kids to go to the electric chair.
4460640	4464480	I don't believe in capital punishment.
4465400	4468640	If you fucking heard a person and you think it's okay,
4468640	4471000	you're fucking damaged goods.
4471000	4473360	And if every person who's damaged goods
4473360	4476240	could trace themselves to Rocky Horror Picture Show,
4476240	4479600	which saved my life, I don't know, man.
4480800	4482400	Where are kids supposed to go?
4482400	4485280	They hang out, they smoke pot behind the gas station
4485280	4488320	in the storm drain.
4488320	4490080	Where do you drive them?
4490080	4492040	When you drive them, they're like,
4492920	4496520	the storm drain, we, explain that.
4496520	4498360	Come on.
4498360	4499960	Do you mean like a huge storm drain?
4499960	4502120	I come from a storm heavy state.
4502120	4504200	Okay, that's, you gotta do that.
4504200	4506000	All right, let's all get distracted by that.
4506000	4506840	Come on.
4506840	4507680	Go ahead.
4507680	4510720	Like, I'm saying, like, I really,
4510720	4512920	I do not want to be guilty of this concept of,
4512920	4516160	oh, boys will be boys, there's just a terrorist cell.
4516160	4520200	I'm like, I just keep getting hung up on this concept
4520280	4524640	of like, is this the thing?
4524640	4529640	Like, it's a fucking IP address where they all,
4531560	4533320	and the only thing it has in common
4533320	4538320	is that it's the place where these twisted dark souls
4538560	4540440	are communicating with each other.
4540440	4541280	Yeah, I mean.
4541280	4544640	And we want to go like, break it, break it.
4544640	4545680	And I just.
4545680	4547480	Right, and you're like worried about the crisis
4547480	4548840	that will occur after that.
4548840	4550840	No, I'm actually, you know what?
4550840	4552800	No, I'm not, I'm not worried
4552800	4553640	about the crisis that will occur.
4553640	4554760	You don't give a shit about these kids.
4554760	4558160	I believe that the crisis that will occur afterward
4558160	4561480	will be our absolutely justified punishment
4561480	4566480	for the fact that that's not what we should be doing.
4566880	4567720	Right.
4567720	4568540	That's not the solution.
4568540	4569380	Yeah, that's exactly right.
4569380	4571440	It's like a lot of these online solutions
4571440	4573520	are sort of treating the symptom, not the disease, right?
4573520	4575040	So a lot of people were like, you know,
4575040	4576400	a lot of the problems stem on YouTube
4576400	4577760	where the kids just watch YouTube all day
4577800	4579680	and everyone's like, we'll tweak the YouTube algorithm.
4579680	4581280	We'll like kind of talk to the corporation
4581280	4582520	and the corporation will tweak something
4582520	4584120	and they'll think that's not gonna solve
4584120	4586520	your fascism problem in America, right?
4586520	4590800	So, I mean, the issue is like, it's not necessarily,
4590800	4592880	I mean, bringing kids to pool halls or whatever,
4592880	4594140	like bringing kids to other places,
4594140	4597760	but like it's more like there's just so many kids
4597760	4602160	who because of the way that American society works
4602160	4603640	in the 21st century is that, yeah,
4603640	4605760	it's really hard to have hope in your life
4605800	4607960	and have like, you know, go up,
4607960	4609720	like as you described, like go from like,
4609720	4611600	okay, I'm gonna work at school really hard.
4611600	4613640	Then I'm gonna work in my career really hard.
4613640	4614680	And then like 20 years later,
4614680	4616200	I'm actually gonna be happy with my career
4616200	4617040	and my life and all of that.
4617040	4618880	Like, so instead they're like 20 years old
4618880	4620160	and they're like, I'm never gonna have a house.
4620160	4622240	I have $100,000 in school debt.
4622240	4624480	And it's, you know, there's all these corporations
4624480	4627480	who are like, if you play World of Warcraft all day,
4627480	4630160	we will, like that's exactly what you want you to do, right?
4630160	4633280	So it's like, those are the things that are creating it.
4633280	4634960	Maybe the most important thing
4634960	4638720	for like a 17 year old kid listening to this right now,
4638720	4641320	who's like somewhere in the weird middle
4641320	4644320	is to actually say to them, you know what?
4644320	4647800	Forget what anybody is telling you.
4647800	4650440	The actual objective truth is that you have control
4650440	4651520	over your own destiny.
4651520	4653760	You have control over how you feel about the universe.
4653760	4655560	You get to make up your mind tomorrow
4655560	4657440	how you wish people were treated.
4657440	4658960	You get to treat them that way.
4658960	4663960	You, like you're going to be told by a thousand people a day
4665000	4666720	for the next 20 years,
4668600	4670480	you're not allowed, the other side says
4670480	4672120	you're not allowed to do this.
4672120	4677120	And like, okay, we don't even know if that's true.
4678240	4680040	But what's true right now, kid,
4680040	4682600	is that you definitely have agency.
4682600	4683920	You absolutely do.
4683920	4685760	When that stops being true,
4685760	4687680	you won't be listening to this anymore.
4688280	4693280	And you like, be careful
4693280	4697840	because actually by the grace of this great country,
4697840	4701880	you are fully able to be reached by both fascists
4701880	4704720	and socialists, by anarchists and rapists.
4704720	4708720	Like you, I just, yeah, those are the spectrums.
4708720	4711680	That's the spectrum, yeah, the last one surprised me,
4711680	4713640	but okay, all right.
4713640	4714480	You're sorry.
4715480	4717880	Don't let anyone trick you into thinking
4717880	4722120	that they're only reaching you through some limited channel.
4722120	4725640	I'm pretty sure that part of the big problem right now
4725640	4729160	is that if there's a phase of thought,
4729160	4732480	like it is getting through to you.
4732480	4737480	And we are counting on you, little fella, fellat,
4737480	4740480	little non-binary, Armenian,
4740480	4745480	like to recognize that you are somewhere caught on the fence
4745480	4749480	in that verdun, that you need to take advantage
4749480	4753480	of those forces and don't let any of them trick you
4753480	4756480	into thinking this is a war about what you're allowed to do.
4756480	4757480	You're allowed to do anything you want.
4757480	4759480	You were born with the freedom of speech.
4759480	4761480	You were born with the freedom of whoever you want.
4761480	4765480	The law used to say you weren't allowed to do anything
4765480	4769480	and the law used to say you weren't allowed to be gay.
4769480	4772480	In 1998, they let you be gay.
4772480	4775480	It didn't make you not gay in 1997.
4775480	4777480	We will catch up.
4777480	4779480	You don't need to radicalize.
4779480	4784480	You belong to a country, whatever, I'm not patriotic.
4784480	4786480	Don't fucking mass shoot.
4786480	4789480	Don't mass shoot, I have shopping to do.
4789480	4793480	I may wander into a fucking public place.
4793480	4797480	Mass shoot, you little shitbags.
4797480	4799480	I ruined it, I ruined it.
4799480	4801480	I just don't want them to mass shoot.
4801480	4803480	Honestly, that's only, I don't care.
4803480	4806480	Also don't vote, don't vote.
4806480	4809480	Or do vote, but if you vote against mass shooting.
4809480	4811480	Sorry, what are you going to say?
4811480	4813480	I ruined it, I ruined it.
4813480	4816480	Too much time in that motherfucking drain pipe smoking weed.
4816480	4820480	There's a storm drain, fire.
4820480	4822480	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
4822480	4825480	Please, don't apologize.
4825480	4827480	Don't tell me what to do.
4827480	4829480	I've lost it, I've lost it.
4829480	4832480	Is there a journalism version of this?
4832480	4835480	Has this happened, this phenomenon of 4chan and 8chan,
4835480	4837480	has it happened before?
4837480	4838480	Was it Yellow Journalism?
4838480	4840480	Was it Time Magazine in the 20s?
4840480	4841480	Have we ever seen anything?
4841480	4845480	I think that the underlying dynamics of what fascism is,
4845480	4849480	we see what happened with 4chan was replicated in the 1930s,
4849480	4852480	where it was a group of disenfranchised people in the same way
4852480	4856480	who were searching for identities and excuse for being on the bottom
4856480	4859480	and then were so angry they wanted this form of power politics.
4859480	4861480	They didn't trust the press in the same way.
4861480	4863480	Was there internet film?
4863480	4865480	Was there internet film?
4865480	4869480	Were they able to spread out like people are spreading out right now?
4869480	4873480	Yeah, I mean, the weird thing about fascism is that it's not old.
4873480	4874480	Your guest before talked about this,
4874480	4878480	where it's really a result of industrialization in the modern world.
4878480	4880480	So it doesn't stretch farther back than that.
4880480	4882480	So it's a response to all of that.
4882480	4886480	It's a response to industrial capitalism, to film and media coming out,
4886480	4888480	to propaganda, generate, right?
4888480	4890480	All of that was part of the dynamic.
4890480	4892480	I mean, the new part is that we have the internet,
4892480	4893480	it's now manifesting on the internet.
4893480	4894480	That's the new part.
4894480	4897480	And sort of the groupthink part, where they're all together,
4897480	4900480	convincing each other of it, that's a new part,
4900480	4903480	that's a new internet part of the phenomenon.
4903480	4908480	But for the most part, so there's that replication.
4908480	4909480	And then the other replication...
4909480	4915480	So this is like our second time where media has been used to get people together
4915480	4916480	in this respect.
4916480	4917480	Yeah.
4917480	4923480	I mean, it's really like if you think of it in an historical sweep,
4923480	4926480	the way that I frame it in my book is that everyone in the late 19th century
4926480	4928480	thought there would be a crisis of capitalism.
4928480	4931480	It occurred, and instead of what Marx predicted,
4931480	4932480	that we would all become socialists,
4932480	4934480	they became instead of most...
4934480	4936480	Many of the countries in Europe became fascist.
4936480	4937480	And it was invented.
4937480	4938480	We were like, what the hell is this?
4938480	4939480	And it almost took over the world.
4939480	4941480	It was defeated militarily.
4941480	4944480	But then philosophers afterwards and thinkers who wrote on it said,
4944480	4947480	well, maybe it's not defeated intellectually.
4947480	4949480	Maybe it's just militarily.
4949480	4953480	And so now we're at a point where inequality is at the same record highs
4953480	4954480	as it was in the 30s again.
4954480	4956480	And we're seeing the same dynamics again.
4956480	4959480	And so there was sort of this era in the 90s and the 80s
4959480	4962480	where there was the end of history era where they said,
4962480	4964480	American capitalism will last forever.
4964480	4965480	That system will last forever.
4965480	4968480	And now we're seeing a return to the dynamics of the 30s
4968480	4970480	where youth culture is about...
4970480	4973480	We now, again, have socialists and communist youth culture
4973480	4976480	fighting on the streets with fascist youth culture,
4976480	4978480	because the same dynamics are creating it.
4978480	4980480	So that's the replication.
4980480	4981480	Crazy.
4981480	4982480	Yeah. And the other replication...
4982480	4985480	So we can sort of chart five years from now.
4985480	4986480	Yeah.
4986480	4988480	What, World War II? Is that where we're at?
4988480	4989480	Um...
4989480	4990480	Where are we?
4990480	4991480	Well...
4991480	4992480	That is quite...
4992480	4994480	No, we're too old. We're not going to get drafted.
4994480	4997480	I don't fare well no matter what.
4997480	5002480	I mean, the silver lining there is that what I was saying before
5002480	5005480	about them being so young and them in this personal crisis
5005480	5009480	is that, like, during the first 8chan shooting the Christ Church one,
5009480	5011480	the other thing that was happening on the boards was that
5011480	5014480	all of these Trump supporters and fascists were breaking away
5014480	5016480	and they said, well, maybe I should support Andrew Yang
5016480	5018480	because he gives me $1,000 each month, right?
5018480	5020480	So that's, like, a crazy shift, right?
5020480	5021480	But their kid, like...
5021480	5024480	And they felt like, oh, well, this just addresses some of the problems, right?
5024480	5026480	The problem is that I want to join society.
5026480	5028480	And they don't know the answer.
5028480	5030480	They're trying to get the answer off YouTube, which is, like,
5030480	5032480	the worst way to get information ever.
5032480	5033480	Make my A button work.
5033480	5034480	Yeah.
5034480	5037480	Is there a reason why women didn't start this sort of movement?
5037480	5040480	Oh, well, shit. I'll feel that.
5040480	5046480	Thank you, ladies.
5046480	5049480	I appreciate you seeing the irony in that.
5049480	5050480	Yeah, I mean, like, this...
5050480	5051480	People always ask me this.
5051480	5052480	They're like...
5052480	5053480	Is this uniquely masculine?
5053480	5055480	They're like, yeah, look at all these other minority groups.
5055480	5057480	They're not acting like these huge assholes, right?
5057480	5058480	Women aren't...
5058480	5060480	And I'm like, yeah, men are scum.
5060480	5061480	Like, they're...
5061480	5064480	Actually, that is, in a sense, the answer that we know that,
5064480	5068480	for some reason, men, when they feel like losers, act very toxicly.
5068480	5071480	That when they get in the situation, there's a toxic response,
5071480	5074480	and they sort of feed into it and become worse.
5074480	5077480	And they own the identity of being a troll, being obnoxious,
5077480	5078480	and then no one wants to defend them,
5078480	5080480	and they get even worse and worse and worse.
5080480	5082480	So there is, like, this new leftist youth movement,
5082480	5086480	which is kind of created by people who were on the alt-right
5086480	5088480	and got out of it, people who were on 4chan
5088480	5090480	and realized what was happening.
5090480	5092480	And there's sort of, like, this YouTube section where they're like,
5092480	5095480	look, we're going to be compassionate to you.
5095480	5096480	We know what's going on.
5096480	5099480	We want you to come to the left because the left has better solutions.
5099480	5102480	So there are sort of efforts to break it apart,
5102480	5104480	to sort of recognize those underlying dynamics.
5104480	5106480	Because there's sort of a cult mentality.
5106480	5107480	Yeah, that's exactly right.
5107480	5108480	And they're bad answers, right?
5108480	5110480	Like, the answer, like, you think, like, how...
5110480	5112480	They're bad answers, right?
5114480	5116480	I guess I don't have to have the right at the end.
5116480	5117480	No one's like, yeah.
5117480	5121480	No, I tell you, it's just a sad thing to end with that punctuation.
5121480	5123480	I mean, they're bad answers, right?
5124480	5126480	Like, we're all going to die.
5126480	5127480	You get it.
5127480	5128480	You get it.
5128480	5132480	Some guy in the back's like, no, I'm a fascist.
5132480	5135480	I came out because I was hoping not, but...
5138480	5139480	I mean, you wrote a book.
5139480	5141480	I hoped you would have a...
5141480	5143480	Oh, yeah, like, I haven't figured it out yet.
5143480	5144480	Yeah, I'm like, really?
5144480	5145480	Yeah.
5145480	5148480	So, like, in the end, I sort of settled on the idea that fascism was bad.
5148480	5150480	That really was going to be my next question.
5150480	5151480	What do you think is going to happen?
5151480	5154480	What's your unqualified projection?
5154480	5156480	I mean, I know this is what your book is about.
5156480	5159480	Your book is about researching facts and stating things.
5159480	5162480	But as a human being, like, where are you at when you wake up in the morning?
5162480	5165480	Because I go up and down, up and down.
5165480	5167480	I have these, like, mood swings.
5167480	5169480	I feel like I'm living in the end times.
5169480	5170480	Right.
5170480	5172480	And then I'm like, I just...
5173480	5176480	Tell me how to feel, child.
5177480	5180480	I do think that...
5180480	5183480	I think that if the systemic issues are addressed,
5183480	5187480	if, for example, the Democrats win in the next election,
5187480	5190480	if Bernie wins or if someone similar wins,
5190480	5192480	and there are social programs implemented,
5192480	5196480	and things get better for this vast group of marginalized people,
5196480	5198480	then it will get better.
5198480	5201480	Okay, what happens if those things don't happen?
5201480	5202480	Right?
5202480	5205480	So, I mean, look, what?
5205480	5206480	What?
5206480	5208480	Asking for a friend.
5210480	5213480	Okay, yeah, like, well, what happened in Iraq
5213480	5216480	when they, you know, they had millions of young men
5216480	5218480	who were angry and jobless and didn't have...
5218480	5221480	I need to go set fire to oil wells.
5222480	5225480	Yeah, so, you know, you have a vast group of disenfranchised people
5225480	5227480	who think they can never join society,
5227480	5229480	and they're all angry young men, right?
5229480	5231480	What happens to those men, right?
5231480	5233480	Or hip-hop, huh?
5233480	5235480	Yeah, then you get hip-hop, right, like...
5235480	5240480	Brandon, Brandon, stop pushing your agenda.
5240480	5242480	You get... Yeah.
5242480	5244480	This is a serious issue.
5244480	5246480	I was also disenfranchised.
5246480	5249480	Brandon, stop it.
5250480	5253480	Your people have had enough.
5253480	5256480	This is a real thing going on.
5256480	5259480	You can't turn it into a music thing.
5259480	5263480	With the toast that you're trying to make, it's too soft.
5263480	5265480	And the textbook's called...
5265480	5267480	This is about oppressed...
5267480	5269480	This is a discussion about oppressed white people.
5269480	5271480	Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
5271480	5273480	My giant anxiety that you're hitting at, though.
5273480	5275480	Yeah, I mean, the ridiculous thing is that, like,
5275480	5278480	I teach at a HBCU, a certainly black college university,
5278480	5279480	and, like, it's full...
5279480	5281480	Oh, you don't have to tell me.
5281480	5283480	HBCU. HBCU stands for...
5283480	5284480	Which one, by the way?
5284480	5285480	Head Black College.
5285480	5287480	Morgan State, I teach, like, animation.
5287480	5288480	Morgan State, shout out.
5288480	5290480	They all want to be like you. They're all like...
5290480	5291480	Like me?
5291480	5293480	Yeah, they're all like... They want to make animation.
5293480	5294480	Oh, you?
5294480	5295480	Yeah, yeah.
5295480	5296480	I tried to tell you.
5296480	5298480	At a black college, they all want to be like me.
5298480	5300480	And they end many black careers.
5300480	5303480	Have you never been to the Dan Lives Matter?
5303480	5305480	If I... Yeah.
5305480	5307480	If I mention Rick and Morty, that's just the class,
5307480	5309480	then they're just like, well, what happened to Rick and Morty?
5309480	5310480	I fucking did it.
5310480	5314480	I told you to put both of your money into Golden Folk toys.
5315480	5316480	But...
5317480	5319480	But, yeah, like, you know, they...
5319480	5322480	It's like, that's not their response, right?
5322480	5324480	They've had much more difficult lives.
5324480	5326480	And they're just like, I'm going to make beautiful art.
5326480	5328480	Like, that's their resolution.
5328480	5329480	Because it doesn't...
5329480	5334480	It's not acceptable to sort of go off on your own.
5334480	5337480	Like, if a motherfucker was like, where's Daryl been?
5337480	5339480	Like, if Daryl was on 4chan all day,
5339480	5341480	somebody's going to go get him.
5341480	5343480	And be like, hey, man, nah, nah.
5344480	5346480	You got that shooter look on your face.
5346480	5348480	Yeah, they got, like, a lot more common sense, yeah.
5348480	5350480	It's not common sense.
5350480	5351480	It's not common sense.
5351480	5353480	Sometimes there is this great thing out of...
5353480	5357480	And I hate to say this, but out of oppression comes, like, a closeness.
5357480	5360480	So there might be this camaraderie that is not some angelic,
5360480	5361480	we're all African.
5361480	5364480	It might be like, we're literally all poured together,
5364480	5367480	and that's the camaraderie that keeps us from getting distance from one another.
5367480	5368480	Yeah, we're on the same boat.
5368480	5372480	It's a shitty way to get close, but it does save you in the end.
5372480	5374480	Right, yeah, yeah.
5374480	5378480	I have a terrible spell to cast.
5379480	5380480	Sick.
5381480	5384480	It's 2019, so there's an election coming up, right?
5384480	5385480	2020?
5385480	5386480	Yeah.
5386480	5387480	There's a president, gets elected.
5387480	5388480	Yeah.
5388480	5390480	Okay, so you have to choose one president, right?
5390480	5392480	Yeah, yeah, there's only one.
5392480	5399480	So, doesn't it seem like no matter fucking what?
5399480	5400480	Yeah.
5401480	5402480	Civil war.
5403480	5404480	I don't...
5404480	5409480	I mean, is it more likely a civil war will take place in America
5409480	5411480	than ten years ago, five years ago?
5411480	5413480	Yes, right?
5413480	5414480	I don't know.
5414480	5415480	America always surprises us.
5415480	5416480	There are a lot of other scenarios.
5416480	5418480	Yeah, I...
5418480	5419480	Oh, boy.
5419480	5425480	I mean, I think that America does have a lot of safeguards, but, you know,
5425480	5426480	I mean, to...
5426480	5427480	Safeguards.
5427480	5430480	You know, to my leftist friends, my friends on the far left, they're like,
5430480	5432480	they weren't surprised by Trump.
5432480	5434480	They're like, this isn't a glitch, right?
5434480	5439480	This is like the... or America, like the ultimate, like McDonald's chumpy...
5439480	5441480	We're all Tuesday preppin'.
5441480	5442480	Yeah, like...
5442480	5445480	Give me them 30-day sparklets bottles.
5445480	5447480	I mean, there was like...
5447480	5453480	I mean, there was this Gibbon who wrote The Fall of the Roman Empire.
5453480	5454480	He had this expression where he said, like,
5455480	5458480	the empire was so strong that it could survive all these worst leaderships,
5458480	5461480	that the structure itself was good enough, right?
5461480	5462480	Oh, we'll be fine.
5462480	5465480	So, yeah, so it could be that we have really terrible leaders
5465480	5469480	and the structure, there's enough safeguards there, but...
5469480	5472480	It's not like there's another country out there with more money
5472480	5475480	that's got half the population of the Earth that's...
5475480	5477480	No.
5477480	5478480	Yeah, I mean...
5478480	5479480	We don't have anything to worry about.
5479480	5480480	We're fine.
5480480	5482480	We could just have growing pains.
5482480	5485480	Let's have a thousand bad presidents in a row.
5485480	5486480	Just keep it going.
5486480	5487480	I mean, like...
5487480	5490480	There's no such thing as China!
5490480	5491480	Chinese are gonna come in.
5491480	5493480	That's half the Earth!
5493480	5497480	But remember who holds all of our debt.
5497480	5498480	China!
5498480	5500480	Right, but we can default.
5500480	5501480	What? We can default?
5501480	5503480	That's not... Brandon...
5503480	5505480	And we have done that before.
5505480	5506480	What?
5506480	5507480	We have defaulted before.
5507480	5508480	We can't...
5508480	5511480	Brandon, at a certain point, they're going to say...
5511480	5512480	What are they going to do?
5512480	5513480	They're going to send bill collectors?
5513480	5514480	They're going to say...
5514480	5515480	They're not going to do...
5515480	5516480	Yes, they're going to send bill collectors!
5516480	5517480	They're not!
5517480	5518480	Yes!
5518480	5519480	Never happened!
5519480	5520480	Never happened!
5520480	5521480	Why are you talking?
5521480	5525480	That's why T-bills, T-bonds, that's why that's a guarantee.
5525480	5529480	Also, let me tell you, they have a shit ton of newly imported gold.
5529480	5534480	I love that we all think China is just going to hang out and love their money.
5534480	5535480	What else are they going to do?
5535480	5536480	Look, China...
5536480	5538480	Dude, they're waiting!
5538480	5540480	What are you talking about?
5540480	5543480	They're sitting on a shit ton of their debt, of our debt.
5543480	5546480	It's going to take a lot for them to fuck us up.
5546480	5547480	Did China...
5547480	5548480	All right.
5548480	5549480	A promise shoot.
5549480	5550480	A promise shoot.
5550480	5551480	There's only...
5551480	5552480	All right.
5552480	5553480	Okay.
5553480	5554480	All right.
5554480	5555480	Okay.
5555480	5556480	I don't...
5556480	5557480	Look, I didn't take...
5557480	5558480	Let me ask you this question.
5558480	5559480	The next question...
5559480	5562480	Here's the quick breakdown.
5562480	5564480	A guy comes up to you borrows $10.
5564480	5565480	Okay.
5565480	5566480	You can't pay that $10 back.
5566480	5568480	You know you're not going to pay that $10 back.
5568480	5571480	Man, you got $30 in the time that he borrowed that $10.
5571480	5572480	Okay.
5572480	5573480	Who's your new enemy?
5573480	5574480	You got $30.
5574480	5575480	Wait.
5575480	5576480	Wait, wait, wait.
5576480	5578480	You got to take me through that slower.
5578480	5581480	And in the meantime, I assume you're China and you're going to kill me.
5581480	5584480	But you got fucking $30.
5584480	5589480	Yeah, but the $30 becomes worth less than $8.
5589480	5590480	It's technically worth...
5590480	5592480	Because we've done this too many times.
5592480	5594480	Technically, it's worth $20 because you owe $10.
5594480	5595480	They're running out the clock.
5595480	5596480	But the guy that you owe...
5596480	5597480	We're going to be like, hey, China.
5597480	5598480	There's no clock.
5598480	5599480	What?
5599480	5600480	You want to hang out in the pool hall?
5600480	5601480	Oh, I got to...
5601480	5602480	I'm a Mr. Pool Master.
5602480	5603480	And they're like, yes.
5603480	5604480	We're the people who...
5604480	5605480	Yes, you're so good at pool America.
5605480	5607480	We own the pool table.
5607480	5609480	No, we don't own shit.
5609480	5610480	Oh, my God.
5610480	5611480	We're going to die.
5611480	5613480	We set the rates.
5613480	5615480	They're half of the earth.
5615480	5616480	So like...
5616480	5619480	The answer is the guy that you owe $10 becomes your new enemy.
5619480	5622480	So you start to try and take the means of him hitting another...
5622480	5625480	You're so confident.
5625480	5626480	Because I know the numbers.
5626480	5627480	I'm looking at the numbers.
5627480	5628480	I know the numbers.
5628480	5629480	I know the numbers.
5629480	5630480	This guy knows the numbers.
5630480	5631480	This guy knows the numbers.
5631480	5632480	Yeah, he's got...
5632480	5633480	You know the numbers.
5633480	5634480	You know the numbers.
5634480	5635480	Googleable things.
5635480	5636480	It's not difficult.
5636480	5637480	All right.
5637480	5638480	All right.
5638480	5639480	Okay.
5639480	5640480	Well, nothing's going to happen.
5640480	5641480	Everyone...
5641480	5642480	Really?
5642480	5643480	No.
5643480	5644480	You're not worried about China?
5644480	5645480	Why would I be worried about China?
5645480	5646480	All right.
5646480	5647480	Fine.
5647480	5648480	I'm not worried about China.
5648480	5649480	Yeah, don't worry about...
5649480	5650480	You need to worry about...
5650480	5651480	You should worry about Russia.
5651480	5652480	Why would I worry about Russia?
5652480	5653480	They've never done anything wrong.
5653480	5654480	Russia doesn't like it.
5654480	5655480	It's spotless.
5655480	5656480	Russia doesn't like us and they have more money.
5656480	5657480	Yeah.
5657480	5658480	Oh, okay.
5658480	5659480	No, I'm worried about...
5659480	5660480	No, China...
5660480	5661480	Come on.
5661480	5662480	All right.
5662480	5663480	What...
5663480	5664480	Who are you worried about?
5664480	5665480	Israel.
5665480	5666480	Good night, folks.
5666480	5669480	Is there... is there running...
5669480	5671480	They're a little chewy.
5671480	5675480	You might like a granola bar.
5675480	5676480	Chewy.
5676480	5677480	I'm worried about it.
5677480	5678480	Yeah.
5678480	5679480	I'm worried about... a little bit worried about China.
5679480	5681480	I'm a little bit worried about Russia, though.
5681480	5683480	You're worried about Saudi Arabia.
5683480	5684480	A little bit.
5684480	5685480	Those are our bodies.
5685480	5686480	I guess...
5686480	5688480	I'm mostly worried about the US, probably, about China.
5688480	5689480	What?
5689480	5690480	Yeah.
5690480	5691480	Yeah.
5691480	5692480	I mean...
5692480	5693480	That's where we are.
5693480	5694480	Yeah, I know.
5694480	5695480	I know.
5695480	5696480	I know.
5696480	5697480	What are we gonna do?
5697480	5698480	Yeah.
5698480	5699480	I mean, well...
5699480	5700480	We've never done nothing to nobody.
5700480	5701480	Yeah, that's true.
5701480	5702480	Can I ask...
5702480	5703480	We're just trying to hang out.
5703480	5704480	Can I ask, are there other versions of 4chan in other countries or do countries suppress
5704480	5705480	the growth of these sorts of movements?
5705480	5709080	Yeah, so that's the other part that you asked if it had repeated.
5709080	5714200	I talked to a Japanese scholar who's a writer and for his book that he's writing and he
5714200	5718240	told me that it all happened in Japan on 2chan before it happened in the US, so the
5718240	5719240	exact same dynamics.
5719240	5720640	And was the election...
5720640	5723200	Was there an election or an outcome that was similar to ours?
5723200	5724400	How did they demonstrate that?
5724400	5728600	Yeah, so I write about this a little bit in my book where it was the same dynamic where
5728600	5733200	they had had sort of a hacktivist collective and they went leftist and sort of was rebellious
5733200	5734600	but started in otaku culture.
5734600	5737640	Then they went to the far right.
5737640	5743440	And the scandal that I wrote about was in 2012 or so, there was sort of the guy who
5743440	5748480	was running 2chan, it was clear that he was sort of taking money from the traditional
5748480	5754400	conservative party there to delete messages because the board was going to the far right.
5754400	5758600	And then some weird stuff happened where he got kicked out and that was 2014, that was
5758600	5759600	gamer gate.
5759600	5766440	So at that time, the 15-year-old kid now in his 20s, Christopher Mootpool, who was running
5766440	5769440	4chan, he got kicked off, he left 4chan.
5769440	5770440	He sold it, right?
5770440	5773240	Yeah, he sold it to the owner of 2chan.
5774240	5776520	That guy now had no longer had a chance to run.
5776520	5780340	Is 2chan related in any way to the rapper 2chains?
5780340	5781340	If only.
5781340	5782340	Okay.
5782340	5783340	Keep going.
5783340	5789480	Yeah, so there was this musical chair of the musical chairs where the owner of 2chan kicked
5789480	5795480	out of 2chan because of this far right radicalization now runs 4chan, he still runs 4chan.
5795480	5801040	Christopher Mootpool, now he got hired by Google to, no one knows, I asked Google, I
5801040	5804360	was like, hey, you want to tell me what he does for you?
5804360	5805480	Why you hired him?
5805480	5808960	And they said, no, so that's where they wrote back.
5808960	5810480	It's on the behavioral side?
5810480	5816660	Yeah, I mean presumably he writes, he's really good at running, making really cool, addictive
5816660	5817660	websites for young people.
5817660	5819440	He keeps the trains running on time.
5819440	5824220	Yeah, so I mean he probably, I mean another component of this is how young people are
5824220	5828720	addicted to YouTube and they get radicalized on YouTube, which is owned by Google.
5828720	5829720	Hey man.
5829720	5832080	Can I give the kids what they want?
5832080	5838160	And then during the 2channel scandal, who took control of 2channel was this crazy guy
5838160	5841720	in the Philippines who was a US Army veteran.
5841720	5844240	He was running the servers in the Philippines.
5844240	5847880	He took control of 2channel, which is very profitable, unlike the rest of the Chans.
5847880	5851120	And then he used that money to buy 8chan during Game or Game.
5851120	5855000	And he still runs 8chan, so that's Jim Watkins, that's the guy who last week everyone was
5855000	5858280	like, you have to shut it down, and he's like, no.
5858280	5863800	So he's using the 2channel money to run 8chan, that's his only profitable enterprise.
5863800	5868960	So real quick, everyone who's here in the audience tonight, you've been doxxed.
5868960	5872120	Your social security number.
5872120	5876800	Yeah, this dude is jacking off right here, he don't care.
5876800	5880400	I mean they don't troll me that much, maybe now they will, they like, they never notice
5880400	5881400	me.
5881400	5884560	They don't seem to love being talked about.
5884560	5887720	No, they really hate it.
5887720	5891320	I mean, if I were a woman, I think I'd get a lot of shit from them.
5891320	5899280	But I've got to say, I'm in my pool, and I always am, and my fiancé says, Antifa's
5899280	5902800	fighting the Flicky Flack.
5902800	5906000	I don't even know who they're fighting.
5906000	5910960	The president says Antifa should be a terrorist group.
5910960	5917080	I'm like, I'm in my pool, and I'm like, that's stupid.
5917080	5918080	I'm like, that's dumb.
5918080	5919080	Fair response.
5919080	5920080	What does that mean, Antifa?
5920080	5923080	It means, I'm Antifa, there, I said it.
5923080	5925080	Come at me, bro.
5925080	5930040	I'm against fascism, I didn't sign anything.
5930040	5934760	I mean, there is a little bit of a distinction there where you want to go out on the street,
5934760	5937520	and they want to use any means necessary, right?
5937520	5939600	They're not nonviolent protesters.
5939600	5943440	So that is a difference, they want to intimidate those people.
5943440	5947480	And I sympathize with that in many degrees.
5947480	5953800	But at the same time, I can see, yeah, I mean, it's fucking weird, because if when TV was
5953800	5959440	being invented, when America was tuning in Fritz the Cat or whatever the fuck the first
5959440	5964440	image was, Felix, or whatever the fucking, Fritz was a different thing.
5964440	5971120	Honey, I can't see the Indian pointing at the compass.
5971120	5977320	If the first thing that came over those airwaves was a guy going like, hey, you should distribute
5977320	5978320	your wealth.
5978320	5982400	Like, the FCC would be like, fuck this, fuck this, fuck this.
5982400	5989040	And we wouldn't have that, and the internet kind of existed in spite of all of that oversight.
5989040	5990040	Right, yes.
5990040	5991040	Yeah.
5991040	5998520	But it's so, yeah, I mean, I just, I can't, I don't know, I mean, I can't agree more that
5999520	6008680	this is a place where, we've identified the place where it's the most wisely of, I don't
6008680	6012520	want to romanticize that, I don't want to romanticize it like that.
6012520	6016440	Because actually, most wisely is, I think those guys are nice.
6016440	6019600	Yeah, most of them were pretty kind.
6019600	6023480	I just don't, I can't, I can't abide by the-
6023480	6028120	You're just like reeling from the idea that we know where it is, that we know this weird
6028120	6029120	tie is-
6029120	6033400	I don't understand how that ends, that tic-tac-toe game, where we're like, oh, you're here, then
6033400	6034400	we'll-
6034400	6036920	Yeah, and then they just move somewhere else.
6036920	6042160	If I had an analogy for that, then I could understand, because currently, and I understand
6042160	6048680	this is totally Pollyanna, but like, I'm just offering this out to you so that you can say
6048680	6050120	something back to me.
6050120	6056120	It's almost like during the reconstruction period, we're like, bed sheets, gotta get
6056120	6059320	rid of bed sheets.
6059320	6060600	Their hoods are made of-
6060600	6061600	Oh, I see, right.
6061600	6066200	Pillow cases, they're gonna shut down that target, so they're buying those limits.
6066200	6067760	There is a bit of that, yes, right.
6067760	6068760	So I think-
6068760	6069760	Okay.
6069760	6074560	All right, well, Brandon, that's easy for you to say, god damn it, you love targets.
6074560	6079000	So it's treating one of the symptoms, but not actually the disease.
6079000	6080000	Yeah, that's exactly right, yeah.
6080000	6083960	And even, and even might even, yeah, and then I do worry about like, oh, you mush it in the
6084840	6087520	It's not like HN gets shut down, and then all the people that were there were like,
6087520	6089480	oh, well, now I'm no longer a Nazi, right?
6089480	6091520	They go elsewhere.
6091520	6092520	But in terms of-
6092520	6097840	And they even go, when I was 15 years old, here's my story, I was pretending to be a
6097840	6098840	Nazi for a little bit.
6098840	6103480	I thought I'd toy around being a Nazi, and then the thing happened.
6103480	6110240	The federal government shut down HN, and that's when I learned I needed to be racist.
6110480	6115040	I mean, but the component there is that like, HN and the Chans and websites like that, they
6115040	6116720	take a lot of work to maintain.
6116720	6120000	You have to be, you have to have full-time programmers, you have to build it, and you
6120000	6122160	have to constantly rebuild it and maintain it.
6122160	6124160	Oh, this racism got me tired.
6124160	6126160	I'm just kidding.
6126160	6129160	Every day, it's a new hate.
6129160	6133800	I can't even come up with names for these people anymore.
6133800	6135800	And the server fell down.
6135800	6137800	Yeah, yeah.
6137800	6139680	Well, that's a very interesting point.
6140120	6144720	It's something that people have built and maintain, and a lot of those people are trolls
6144720	6149880	like Watkins, or they're people who regret it, like the founder of HN, and it's like,
6149880	6150880	so it's a little bit like-
6150880	6155800	Who himself would be chewed, would be ripped apart by his own people because of his disability,
6155800	6156800	correct?
6156800	6157800	Yeah, he-
6157800	6158800	Because they're not disability.
6158800	6159800	Yeah.
6159800	6163680	I mean, that's one of those weird, where he, yeah, I mean, that's certainly a contradiction.
6163680	6164680	You're crazy.
6164680	6169720	He kind of almost tilt it to the far right for a little bit.
6169720	6173600	When he was deep in the, he was sort of deep in the incel culture and was administering
6173600	6179440	some of the sites that had started Gammergate, and he wrote for one of the most famous trolls,
6179440	6184480	was a 4chan troll that then started the Daily Stormer, and the founder of HN, Fredrik Brennan,
6184480	6193440	he wrote for the Daily Stormer, and his article was like, I am a disabled supporter of eugenics.
6194440	6195440	Whoa.
6195440	6199800	Yeah, he's like people, because he said that his dad had him to collect the disability
6199800	6200800	checks.
6200800	6202760	So he's like, people should be tested for this disease.
6202760	6203760	God damn.
6203760	6207840	So that was like the darkness of like, so it's like he embodies sort of that idea of
6207840	6211080	like really people on the bottom on these sites.
6211080	6212080	It's kind of cool.
6212080	6219280	It's punk rock, like that joke of what do my dad and cancer, what's the difference
6219280	6220720	between my dad and cancer?
6220720	6222800	Wait, what does it go?
6223560	6225080	God, this is like a funny podcast.
6225080	6226080	What's the joke?
6226080	6227080	What's the joke?
6227080	6228080	My dad.
6228080	6229080	Wait, fuck.
6229080	6230080	Ah, fuck.
6230080	6232400	What's the difference between me and cancer?
6232400	6233400	My dad beat cancer.
6233400	6234400	Right.
6234400	6235400	Wait, no, that's not right.
6235400	6236400	No, that means we do it.
6236400	6237400	No, it's not.
6237400	6238400	Whatever.
6238400	6239400	Whatever.
6239400	6240400	I'm not fucking enough not to show you out there.
6240400	6242000	It's awesome to go dark.
6242000	6244920	It's like, it's especially, it gives you fucking credit.
6244920	6249160	I mean, the more suicidal you are, it's like fucking like people are like, listen to this
6249160	6250160	guy.
6250160	6252680	He's fucking like, he's on the edge of the earth.
6253560	6254560	Like, listen to him.
6254560	6255560	Yeah.
6255560	6256560	And yeah.
6256560	6260240	So, so the metaphor is like, it's like, you know, they build all this stuff.
6260240	6263160	So it's like someone, you know, you built your show, you made your show, like you, all
6263160	6266080	this creative forces went into making and then someone's like, I want to write for it.
6266080	6268640	Well, it's like, well, you, who, you get to use it.
6268640	6269640	Why?
6269640	6270640	Right?
6270640	6272240	So all of the stuff that someone else built, why are you maintaining it?
6272240	6273360	Why are you building it?
6273360	6276840	Like all of that, like, do they get the right to have a Chan?
6276840	6281960	I just don't understand the right to have a space on the Internet.
6281960	6283600	That doesn't make any sense to me.
6283600	6288640	I do understand the idea of like, oh, it takes so much money to keep this place alive.
6288640	6289640	Right.
6289640	6293960	If you found out that Tumblr was only possible because someone kept pumping money into it
6293960	6298120	and they kept taking a loss and be like, well, did you know this is about Tumblr?
6298120	6299120	Right.
6299120	6300120	Yeah.
6300120	6301120	That it just seems, I don't know.
6301120	6302400	So you're right.
6302400	6305680	That part of it is reactionary where people are like, we need a solution to this problem.
6305680	6308600	And then everyone on Twitter and all the experts are saying they're like, well, we just shut
6308600	6309600	down a Chan.
6309600	6312840	That will get less teens radicalized, which is true.
6312840	6313840	Right.
6313840	6315960	When they break apart, they have to reform.
6315960	6320560	But yeah, it does not address those systemic underlying problems that create these people
6320560	6322160	in the first place.
6322160	6323160	So you're right.
6323160	6325880	It's like whack-a-mole where there will be another one.
6325880	6328520	But actually what happened is they went to another one.
6328520	6331360	They went to Enchan, and Enchan immediately crashed.
6331360	6334320	Well, it was immediately going to 4chan to 8chan, to go to 16chan.
6334320	6335640	I don't know if that's how the numbers work.
6335640	6340720	It's actually, if you look historically at these sites, it's only the fluke of Jim Watkins
6340720	6345120	in the Philippines having all the money through 2chan that allows 8chan to exist.
6345120	6347680	So the next one they went to immediately collapsed.
6347680	6349600	Like the guy that's running that, there's no way.
6349600	6350600	And this has happened.
6350600	6355080	It happened like 2006 and 2007, where they're like, 4chan's not bad enough.
6355080	6356320	We want an even worse one.
6356320	6358840	And then they went to these other ones, and they all collapsed.
6358840	6361480	So it's actually very hard to maintain the Chan.
6361480	6362480	OK.
6363360	6368920	We should read your book and find out, like OK, so what is the money that goes into the
6368920	6375120	antenna that pumps these forums open?
6375120	6381680	Because they actually are not just part of the central park of the New York of the internet.
6381680	6384680	Bad metaphor.
6384680	6391800	It takes a bunch of fucking money to force open that part of the internet.
6391800	6398400	And in fact, if normal libertarian free market politics were in play, it wouldn't be profitable.
6398400	6399400	It would shut down.
6399400	6407080	So it's an actual fucking political, like someone has to be passionate to take a loss
6407080	6409480	that keeps that beacon open.
6409480	6412720	And that still is not to say, shut it down.
6412720	6414600	They don't have the right to have it.
6414600	6417720	But it's certainly important to know who that person is.
6417720	6418720	Right.
6418720	6419720	Yeah, exactly.
6419720	6422400	Maybe they leave it open and use it as like an FBI honeypot.
6422400	6423400	Why is this open?
6423400	6424400	Why is this channel open?
6424400	6427080	I mean, it's the same where they'll go to Discord, right?
6427080	6430360	When someone built Discord, which is this chap ad, and they have to maintain it, and
6430360	6431360	there's a ton of programmers.
6431360	6433680	This isn't a profitable pool hall.
6433680	6436560	So who loves it this much?
6436560	6437560	Yeah.
6437560	6442080	So the people that build these things, they have the right to say, I built it.
6442080	6444960	You can go learn HTML, right?
6444960	6445960	You can code HTML.
6445960	6452800	That's where free market politics and liberalism can, in a second, go, hey, whoa, let's follow
6452800	6454200	the money.
6454200	6459600	How is this not, you can raise suspicion about people that aren't profiting from something
6459600	6463040	for over 10 years ago, like, why are you spending so much money on this?
6463040	6464880	It almost seems like a charity for you.
6464880	6466120	Yeah, I mean, it did.
6466120	6467120	He's a troll.
6467120	6468120	That's what he wants to say.
6468120	6469120	What's his source of income?
6469120	6470120	Two channel.
6470120	6472120	So two channel, because two channel is different.
6472120	6473120	It was the first one.
6473120	6474280	It didn't have images.
6474280	6479740	So without images, the server costs are much lower, which means that it actually is profitable.
6479740	6482120	It's a business model that is profitable.
6482120	6488280	And two channel also, like 4chan, first, in Japan, it was this sort of dark otaku place
6488280	6489960	where the otaku hung out.
6489960	6492960	And then it just became one of the most popular sites in Japan.
6492960	6495640	And it was like deeply influential in the culture.
6495640	6496980	And everyone kind of uses it.
6496980	6501000	And they kind of delight in the anonymity because Japanese society is so structured.
6501000	6505400	So it's sort of like similar to 4chan, but it had this big cultural impact.
6505400	6507760	So he gets all his money through that.
6507760	6510760	And we think that's how much?
6510760	6513240	That I don't know what the numbers are.
6513240	6515000	And we have like, I don't know how many.
6515000	6517760	It's got to be a burgeoning empire.
6517760	6518760	All right.
6518760	6523000	Well, since tonight, I assume because these people don't like being talked about period,
6523000	6528120	even though we've tried to talk about them objectively, I'll tell you, I jerk off on
6528120	6529120	a mannequin leg.
6529120	6536000	I rub it on my nipple, I put a sharpie pin on my ass, a sexually harrassed coworker and
6536000	6537000	community.
6537000	6538000	I thought we weren't going to talk about it.
6538000	6539000	Is it?
6539000	6540000	Is this their part?
6540000	6544680	I simulated making passionate love to a baby in a comedy schedule in 2009.
6544680	6547200	At the end, did we confess everything we did wrong?
6547200	6548400	No, you don't have to.
6548400	6549400	I'm just protecting myself.
6549400	6550400	That's just what happens.
6550400	6553120	I'm like, I'm like done with this.
6553120	6554760	Like I can't think of anything.
6554760	6555760	You forgive him?
6555760	6556760	Like, whatever.
6556760	6557760	I'm a horrible person.
6557760	6563240	Some people brag, but somebody's as wise.
6563240	6567640	Don't reelect me as your alderman in 2000, whatever it is.
6567640	6568640	There.
6568640	6569640	I just wanted to cover myself.
6569640	6570680	You can do whatever you want.
6570680	6574600	Can I ask before we go real quick is what is the thing that the average person could
6574600	6575600	do?
6575600	6576600	I know this sounds crazy.
6576600	6580600	Like it's a Kemp Brockman piece, but is there a way that people protect themselves from
6580600	6582440	being a target of these groups?
6582440	6583440	Yeah.
6583600	6589800	I mean, I think the best thing is not if they really do target you.
6589800	6591720	You can take proactive action.
6591720	6596520	The target of gamergate, Zoe Quinn, the main one, she had dedicated a lot of work to what
6596520	6597520	exactly to do.
6597520	6598800	So she has a lot of resources.
6598800	6601040	I would recommend her book for that.
6601040	6602040	Excellent.
6602040	6604120	But yeah, there's definitely recourse.
6604120	6608120	People are more cognizant of now that it happens.
6608120	6612280	But certainly like, yeah, they pick who they want.
6612280	6618160	There's a lot of sort of emotional advice there where you don't want to overreact.
6618160	6624200	You don't want to try and let it get to you because, I mean, they're idiots.
6624200	6627160	It can put a gun in your mouth.
6627160	6629160	What?
6629160	6630880	It can put a gun in your mouth, you say?
6630880	6631880	Yeah.
6631880	6634360	People don't like being told that they're a horrible human being.
6634360	6635360	Yeah.
6635360	6636360	Right.
6636360	6638200	It can make you want to kill yourself.
6638200	6639200	Yeah.
6639200	6644200	And the internet is full of very, you know, we're all deep sensitive souls.
6644200	6648320	So it's like very easy to get upset about stuff that happens on the internet, anyone.
6648320	6649320	Yeah.
6649320	6650320	They know that.
6650320	6651320	Yeah.
6651320	6652320	They know what they're doing.
6652320	6653320	Yeah.
6653320	6654320	And so they love it.
6654320	6655320	Yeah.
6655320	6656320	I mean, they're ultimately very powerless, which is why they do it through the internet.
6656320	6658840	So if you kind of recognize that, you can get a handle.
6658840	6661880	Your book is called, it came from something awful.
6661880	6664600	It came from something awful.
6664600	6668160	Look for it at B Dalton.
6668160	6669160	Back in the 90s.
6669160	6670160	Yeah.
6670160	6673440	Like look for it at the B Dalton and stranger things like in the mall.
6673440	6674440	Yeah.
6674440	6675440	Uh, yeah.
6675440	6676440	Steal it.
6676440	6677440	No, that's not.
6677440	6679080	Uh, thank you so much for coming.
6679080	6686360	I think, I think the only thing we have left to do is a, is a rap about, um, uh, the internet.
6686360	6687360	Yeah.
6687360	6712560	Here's a wicket, wicket, rhythm, yo, yo, yo, internet, internet, internet, internet, internet.
6712560	6718840	I got an internet, internet, internet, internet.
6718840	6721120	I just a second back.
6721120	6724800	I'm gonna drink a, a brunette burger.
6724800	6727480	I'll fuck your mother so hard.
6727480	6728480	But be okay.
6728480	6729480	I can't.
6729480	6732480	All right, hold on, hold on.
6732480	6733480	Internet.
6733480	6734480	Internet.
6734480	6735480	Take it.
6735480	6736480	Break it.
