0	24000	Check, check. Howdy gang, how's it going?
24000	28000	Thank you, give me a moment while I plug in. How's things?
28000	34000	It smells always like awesome popcorn in here, which I love.
34000	38000	What did you say? We love it.
38000	42000	Zach McKeever up there in the booth, how's it going man?
42000	47000	Give it up for Zach, the man with the...
47000	52000	The guy who makes it sound good, and if it sounds not good, it's not Zach's fault.
52000	58000	Because Zach rules.
58000	70000	What's today's date? The 19th.
70000	79000	From nearby downtown Los Angeles, Harmontown is now in session.
79000	93000	Please give it up for the hardest working game master in town, Spencer Crittenden.
93000	102000	And the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.
103000	107000	One, two, to the three, to the four.
107000	111000	Three, four, and the four, and the four. Got a two by four.
111000	113000	Five, six.
113000	115000	Build a door.
115000	119000	I was still on four. You went on to six.
119000	122000	Four to the four to the two to the six.
122000	125000	Fuck your mama with dicks.
125000	128000	Seven, eight.
128000	132000	Ain't no hate when I'm fucking your mom.
132000	135000	My name's fucking Tom.
135000	138000	I like to fuck her hard.
138000	140000	Yard.
140000	143000	Always rhyme hard.
143000	145000	With yard.
145000	148000	Fucking your mom hard.
148000	150000	Fuck her in the front yard.
150000	153000	I'm gonna fuck her in the street.
153000	155000	Fucking mamas can't be beat.
155000	158000	Fuck your mama on the surface of the sun.
158000	161000	Fucking mamas is job number one.
161000	171000	Everybody's mama needs me to fuck them.
171000	173000	One to the ten.
173000	176000	Fuck your mama.
176000	181000	All right, I was gonna say phlegm, and then I was like, it's gonna get gross.
181000	184000	You kind of phoned that one in, Dan. I gotta be honest with you.
184000	187000	Yeah, well, but couldn't you see I was trying not to?
187000	192000	And let's make the theme of the show gratitude, because it's Thanksgiving.
192000	195000	Aren't you thankful to me? You could see on my face.
195000	197000	He's not enjoying this.
197000	202000	And then you think it's probably why he's not very entertaining.
202000	207000	But then the last thought should be, yeah, but look at him go.
207000	209000	Look at him.
209000	212000	Look at that sense of obligation on his face.
212000	215000	I'm so fortunate to have a guy in his life that thinks he owes me something.
215000	218000	You kind of phoned in the baby kicky dance, too.
218000	220000	It was like it was kind of a half-baby kicky.
220000	223000	Well, I gotta be honest. I'm not in a bad mood or anything.
223000	226000	I'm a little exhausted.
226000	229000	Because we just finished season three of Harmon Quest.
229000	235000	Oh, damn.
235000	237000	Spencer.
237000	240000	As tag treasure season.
240000	242000	Yeah, we got no treasure.
242000	243000	No, you got some.
243000	246000	Well, we got a little treasure. I think I got some treasure.
246000	250000	This is going to be a fucking awesome season because Spencer fucking did all the hard work
250000	254000	and all we did was just goof off. The guests were amazing. It's going to be good.
254000	256000	Have you been moved backward?
256000	261000	I've been every week. I've been withdrawing one inch.
261000	264000	Are you trying to get out of the show? Are you trying to escape?
264000	272000	One of these days, I'll be announced and I'll just walk in and then walk out and take my place.
272000	275000	Yeah, you're further afield than you normally are.
275000	278000	Yeah. Yeah.
278000	281000	You want me to upstage myself?
281000	285000	No, we don't need nothing from nobody.
285000	288000	I'm sure there's a rhyme to the reason.
288000	290000	I'm sure.
290000	292000	And a reason for the season.
292000	305000	I'm sure the president's committed treason. I'm sure diseases cause lesions.
305000	307000	Thanksgiving can't be beat.
307000	309000	Fuck your mama in her feet.
309000	311000	Put the turkey on a plate.
311000	314000	Indians, pilgrims, hate.
314000	316000	Put it aside. Sit down at a table.
316000	318000	Make it wide.
318000	320000	Eat the gravy.
321000	323000	Wave, wave, eat.
323000	326000	Damn.
326000	328000	I mean, I'm like...
328000	332000	You were loose before the beat came on. You were spitting fire before that beat came on.
332000	335000	Yeah, well, listen to that beat. It's like a little...
335000	338000	Zach, don't do it right now, but Zach, you got the beat.
338000	341000	Well, don't call my bluff with the beat thing.
341000	348000	I'm saying, Zach, keep one in the chamber. If I point at you, then we're ready to go.
348000	351000	I was a little exhausted. I saw you at the drawing room today.
351000	356000	I went in there to get my work done for Rick and Morty before we...
356000	359000	Yeah, and for people that think that Dan doesn't work hard,
359000	363000	he sat at the drawing room with James, whatever his name is, one of the writers from the show,
363000	369000	and you guys sat down there and Dan put his pantomime thinking glasses on
369000	373000	and sat down there and completely worked on a script.
373000	376000	You actually were doing hard Rick and Morty work there.
376000	379000	Yeah, at a bar.
379000	382000	I just had a little loose end to tie up.
382000	386000	One of the scripts started to fix it a little bit.
386000	390000	I actually experienced a great deal of...
390000	395000	I was like, oh shit, I only had one drink and then I opened the laptop and I was like,
395000	398000	ugh, I'm so...
398000	401000	You shouldn't do this. This is unprofessional.
401000	404000	I was kind of tired.
405000	408000	And then I finished up and I had a couple more drinks.
408000	414000	Cody came by and then I went home and I went to bed and I woke up like an hour ago
414000	417000	and I'm just a little tired.
417000	420000	And you've only got 65 more episodes to go.
420000	422000	Yeah.
424000	426000	What are we grateful for?
426000	429000	I got my health. I got my career.
429000	432000	I got Cody.
432000	434000	I got Cody.
434000	438000	You got your new video game that you spend more time with than anybody else?
438000	442000	I got No Man's Sky, is what you're referring to.
442000	448000	I'm enjoying playing No Man's Sky right now.
448000	452000	I'm concerned that I'm going to stop enjoying it,
452000	456000	but that doesn't seem like a fair thing to not enjoy about a game.
456000	459000	That's not fair to the game. You can't call that a negative thing.
459000	461000	I'm enjoying it right now. I keep playing it.
461000	469000	But I looked ahead, as it were, I typed in No Man's Sky Automation
469000	472000	because I was like, what am I doing all this crap for?
472000	476000	Am I ever going to get to watch it do itself?
476000	482000	And the answer is no, no. You're going to run around collecting minerals forever.
483000	487000	You're never going to get to just make a machine that feeds into another machine
487000	489000	and then puts it all into a chest.
489000	492000	I want to play Minecraft again.
492000	494000	It sounds like fancy Minecraft.
494000	496000	It's Minecraft in space.
496000	499000	It's ticking a lot of boxes that should excite me a lot.
499000	502000	It does excite me a lot. It's Minecraft in space.
502000	505000	When is somebody going to understand?
505000	509000	I just want a game where you just go into an infinite universe
509000	514000	and you go around and you mine resources
514000	520000	and then you craft stuff and then you store it in chests.
520000	524000	Why is that game 15 years old now?
524000	526000	How come nobody can replicate it?
526000	533000	I play all these Minecraft-esque games and they don't compare.
533000	535000	I don't get it.
535000	537000	Do you miss your Minecraft?
537000	540000	I still know where it is. I can find it.
540000	543000	You get a little tired of it after a while.
543000	547000	I'll take six months off of it, but then I'll end up going back to it eventually.
547000	549000	It's weird to me.
549000	551000	It's like a relationship.
554000	556000	Are you okay, Dan?
556000	558000	I'm just tired. You're a little sleepy right now.
558000	560000	Didn't I answer that before you asked?
560000	563000	I'm trying to dig a little deeper right now.
563000	566000	We don't have to do the show if you don't want.
566000	571000	A lot of times when people ask, are you okay like that,
571000	574000	they mean you're not okay or something.
574000	580000	I'm asking, is there something on your mind or is it simply just fatigue?
580000	584000	I couldn't have been more transparent forthcoming with that information.
584000	588000	I led with it at the risk of bringing the entire audience down.
588000	595000	People that came out here paid good money, risked robbery on the sidewalk.
595000	598000	I tried to be honest. That's all I have is my truth.
598000	601000	I'm like, yeah, I'm a little tired, a little exhausted.
601000	604000	I don't want to say that I don't feel like being here.
604000	607000	That would be a rude thing to say to people that felt like being here.
607000	610000	We have a surprise for the audience tonight because tonight,
610000	613000	is it too early to announce what we're going to do for the finale of the show?
613000	616000	No, I think we've got to win them back.
616000	618000	We're going to get these people.
618000	625000	Because I was in the mood to play some D&D for all y'all.
625000	628000	But for the first time, because Spencer's also exhausted,
628000	630000	and rightfully so, from doing Harmon Quest,
630000	632000	he didn't bring any of his materials.
632000	635000	So tonight, Dan is going to be Dungeon Master,
635000	643000	and Spencer and I are going to play D&D together.
643000	647000	Do you think you got what it takes right now to be a Dungeon Master?
647000	651000	Yeah. Let's do it now.
651000	653000	This is not enough.
653000	655000	Oh, shit.
664000	667000	Where's Spencer theme?
667000	669000	I just wanted to sit down.
669000	671000	Yeah.
671000	673000	That's not how you usually keep the microphone.
673000	675000	Oh, yeah.
675000	677000	What do you mean?
677000	680000	Are you taller than me?
680000	682000	I'm Hunter?
682000	684000	Like that?
684000	686000	I'm kind of doing that, yeah.
688000	691000	Don't you ever want it to be a little lower?
691000	694000	I do. That's why I bend it down lower.
694000	696000	Right.
696000	697000	Right?
697000	699000	You poor little thing.
699000	701000	I know.
701000	704000	This is a silly way to have a mic. It's blocking half your face.
704000	707000	That's what I like about it.
707000	710000	You know what I got going on back there most of the time?
710000	711000	A hard-on?
711000	712000	Ants.
712000	713000	Aids?
713000	714000	Ants.
714000	716000	Ants.
716000	717000	Yeah.
717000	720000	He's got a little bit of AIDS back there.
722000	724000	Spencer, what are you grateful for?
724000	729000	Oh, I'm grateful for friends and fun and food.
731000	732000	Oh, food.
732000	734000	Oh, man, you guys. Holy shit.
734000	735000	We were in New York.
735000	739000	I got this banana pudding at this place called Magnolia Bakery.
739000	740000	It was so good.
740000	741000	I went back.
741000	743000	I bought two more banana puddings.
743000	744000	It was so good.
744000	746000	I went back home.
746000	749000	There was a Magnolia Bakery in L.A.
749000	752000	and I went back and got some more.
753000	755000	It was so good.
755000	759000	And all of the dressing rooms at the Harmon Quest shoot,
759000	761000	there was a note on our table that said,
761000	763000	look in the fridge.
763000	764000	Yeah.
764000	767000	And there was two banana puddings and one for me,
767000	768000	one for church.
768000	770000	Maybe there was two in every fridge.
770000	773000	And they were all for Jeff and Church.
773000	776000	And it said, this banana pudding is from Spencer.
776000	778000	That was very sweet of you.
778000	779000	That shit was good.
779000	781000	It's so good.
781000	785000	And you can make it yourself because I have the recipe.
785000	789000	Next Harmon Town, I want you to bring enough banana pudding
789000	790000	for everybody.
790000	791000	All right.
791000	793000	That's easy enough.
793000	794000	All right.
794000	798000	What kind of characters are you interested in portraying today,
798000	799000	gentlemen?
799000	800000	What is Jeff want?
800000	802000	You're the game master, Dan.
802000	804000	What kind of realm do you want to put us in?
804000	807000	Is this a fantasy realm, like a Pathfinder D&D?
807000	808000	Yes.
808000	810000	Okay.
810000	813000	And Spencer, what kind of class?
813000	814000	Do you want dice?
814000	815000	It's going to freestyle.
815000	817000	I could use a couple of dice.
817000	819000	Did anybody bring any dice, by the way?
819000	820000	No.
820000	822000	See, in the old days, our fans all had dice.
822000	823000	In the old days.
823000	824000	Yeah.
824000	828000	I mean, I'll just roll them in my mind.
828000	829000	That's fair.
829000	834000	It's my favorite James Taylor song.
834000	837000	I'll be rolling in my mind.
837000	839000	That's Billy Ocean.
839000	845000	You've got dice that I'm rolling, rolling in my mind.
845000	848000	20 sides of booty.
848000	851000	20 sides of booty.
851000	854000	20 sides of booty?
854000	855000	Yep.
855000	856000	Oh, you got dice?
856000	857000	For real, bring them up.
857000	860000	Bring them up, sir.
860000	861000	Now we're talking.
861000	864000	Oh, shit.
864000	865000	Oh, thank you, sir.
865000	866000	What's your name?
866000	867000	Greg.
867000	868000	Greg, everybody.
868000	869000	Greg.
869000	870000	The dice donor.
870000	871000	Oh, shit.
871000	873000	Greg, have a seat for a moment, Greg.
873000	875000	Greg, let's meet you for a moment.
875000	878000	Are you a longtime Harman town goat?
878000	879000	Do you come here a lot?
879000	881000	No, this is my first time here.
881000	882000	Your first time here?
882000	883000	Oh, shit.
883000	885000	Not my first Harman town, though.
885000	889000	And you had the prescience to bring a sack full of dice.
889000	890000	It's in my backpack.
890000	891000	Really?
891000	892000	Fantastic.
892000	895000	Are you a game master or just a game player?
895000	896000	Just a game player.
896000	897000	What do you play?
897000	898000	Mostly Pathfinder.
898000	903000	We just started a fifth edition game with some of my friends, and I'm going to join
903000	906000	a Wednesday game coming up next week.
906000	907000	Damn.
907000	908000	Fantastic.
908000	909000	Greg, was it?
909000	910000	Yeah.
910000	911000	Where are you from?
911000	912000	Santa Monica, actually.
912000	913000	Santa Monica?
913000	914000	Yeah.
914000	916000	Should we keep Greg up here and play along with us?
916000	917000	Yeah.
917000	923000	I mean, we're using your lumber right now.
923000	924000	We should keep you up here.
924000	926000	Dan, how do you want to start this off?
926000	927000	Anything from us?
927000	929240	Greg, what kind of character?
929240	930240	It's Greg?
930240	931240	Yeah.
931240	932240	It's Greg.
932240	935600	What kind of character do you like to play or would you like to play?
935600	937600	I could be a cleric.
937600	938600	Okay.
938600	939600	Done.
939600	940600	Damn.
940600	941600	What do you want to be, Jeff?
941600	942600	Jeff?
942600	943600	I never do this.
943600	944600	I'm going to go...
944600	946120	I've never done this like a straight up fighter.
946120	947120	I want to be like a warrior.
947120	948120	All right.
948120	949120	Spencer.
949120	951120	Can I be a thief?
951120	952120	Yes.
952120	953120	Yay.
953120	954120	Be a what?
954120	955120	A rogue.
955120	956120	Oh, yeah.
956120	957120	Oh, yeah.
957120	958120	Vote for legal staff.
958120	959120	Right.
959120	960120	All right.
960120	967120	So we got Greg as a cleric, me as a warrior, Spencer as a thief, rogue.
967120	968120	All right.
968120	969120	Oh, boy.
969120	970120	Okay.
970120	979120	You can feel the fucking awesome dramatic tension in the stage right now.
979120	980120	No, I'm excited.
980120	981120	Oh, shit.
981120	982120	Lighting change.
982120	983120	Lighting change.
983120	985320	Bring your campaign in my head.
985320	986320	It's now loading.
986320	988320	Compiling, yeah.
988320	991440	Tip.
991440	995560	If you attack an enemy, you gain experience.
995560	999440	Oh, that's a load screen, too.
999440	1000440	Tip.
1000440	1001440	Alcohol.
1001440	1007160	Okay, Dan, whenever you're ready, I'll give you the Spencer theme so you can do the thing.
1007160	1009880	Or do you want to talk us out for a bit?
1009880	1015600	It's probably best to just jump in before I can really think about this, I think, because
1015600	1016600	what am I going to do?
1016600	1018600	Make it good.
1018600	1027400	Throughout history, the realm of fall staff has been besieged by war and famine.
1027400	1039640	This war-torn, famineist realm has one center of population in the dead middle of it.
1039640	1052400	A bustling, thriving city called Sintopolis, where men and women and non-binary unicorns
1052400	1059840	hang clothes from clotheslines and pursue other acts of happiness.
1059840	1070560	But an omen of doom is on the horizon for this normally peaceful realm.
1070560	1086080	For the king of tribbles is planning something unbeknownst to our heroes who find themselves
1086080	1094400	locked in a dungeon deep in the town hall of Sintopolis for crimes which they can't
1094400	1101400	even talk about yet.
1101400	1105440	Blue apron.
1105440	1110400	Oh, yeah.
1110400	1114000	Okay, yeah.
1114000	1121320	So basically, you guys are in, you're in, oh, man, you're in this jail cell.
1121320	1127520	There's like bars and stuff, it's like so many bars, it's like, it's like so jaily.
1127520	1129120	How many bars?
1129120	1136320	Oh, man.
1136320	1140000	You deduced that there's about 12 bars.
1140000	1141560	Yeah.
1142560	1146440	It's easy, right?
1146440	1153880	I am an orc warrior and I go up to the bars and see if I can try to bend them with my
1153880	1154880	strength.
1154880	1159720	Okay, so do you guys see that this big orc warrior is just going up to the bars and he's
1159720	1164720	just like trying to, as if he's trying to bend the bars.
1164720	1167160	But you guys don't know each other.
1167160	1175440	You all three just woke up about 20 minutes ago and now this orc fighter is just bending
1175440	1176640	at the bars.
1176640	1178640	You find them immovable.
1178640	1179640	Oh.
1179640	1180640	Hey.
1180640	1181640	Hey.
1181640	1182640	Hi.
1182640	1196120	My name's Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.
1196120	1199320	My name is Tom, Tom, Tom, just call me Tom.
1199320	1201320	These bars are immovable.
1201320	1214680	Hi, Tom, I'm Lars, Lars Stevens, and I'm a cleric.
1214680	1216840	Use some of your magic to get me out of this jail.
1216840	1219200	I have a baby to feed.
1219200	1220200	Oh.
1220200	1222200	Whoa, that's crazy.
1222200	1224900	Who are you?
1224920	1228020	My name is Trace Butt.
1228020	1229020	Trace Butt?
1229020	1230820	Yeah.
1230820	1245780	Trace Butt, you notice, as you're kind of casing the jail cell with your thief casing
1245780	1254260	instincts, you see at the bottom of every other one of the bars is a tiny rune.
1254940	1258300	At the bottom of these bars are runes.
1258300	1261620	This thief guy says that.
1261620	1266700	Can I use my knowledge of magics to determine if they're magical runes?
1266700	1269580	Waving your arms in a magical manner.
1269580	1278180	You bring, oh man, you detect so much.
1278180	1286100	These are standard runes from the magic guild that lords over this realm's magic activities.
1286100	1292380	They're basically like just sort of containment runes, so basically like this is a jail cell
1292380	1296140	for people, whether they're magic or not.
1296140	1297140	Pretty standard runes?
1297140	1303140	Like if you were to try to turn invisible in here, it would either not let you or it
1303140	1312740	would alert somebody or maybe like in a pool when you try to pee and it would stain you.
1312740	1315860	All you know is that they're security runes.
1315860	1317440	That's no good.
1317440	1322980	You guys saw this cleric, he's like, oh, he's like scrutinizing these runes.
1322980	1326340	Oh man, what are you doing?
1326340	1328340	We can't use magic to get out of here, I think.
1328340	1330660	Or if we do, it'll alert the guards.
1330660	1331660	Okay.
1331660	1332660	I can try though.
1333660	1336660	What if, what do these locks look like?
1336660	1337660	Sorry, what?
1337660	1340660	What do the locks look like on the bar, on the door?
1340660	1341660	Oh man.
1341660	1342660	You look like a thief.
1342660	1343660	You can pick a lock, right?
1343660	1344660	I've seen some locks.
1344660	1349660	The locks look like nothing to you because they lock from the other side.
1349660	1352660	Damn, clever.
1352660	1361660	I mean, being a thief, you've been in jail cells before.
1361660	1363660	I've been in jail cells before.
1363660	1371660	You think, even just looking at the back of this lock, the casing for it, you kind of
1371660	1374660	know it's pretty heavy duty stuff.
1374660	1377660	It's like anti-thief lock.
1377660	1380660	This is my worst enemy.
1380660	1384660	Hey, quit looking at that lock, thief.
1384660	1385660	Okay.
1385660	1386660	Okay, this guy comes over.
1386660	1387660	This guy comes over.
1387660	1391660	He's got fox pelts all over his shoulders.
1391660	1396660	He's got a wooden crown that's blood-stained.
1396660	1398660	He's wearing spectacles.
1398660	1403660	One of the lenses in his spectacles is dark green.
1403660	1405660	The other is no glass at all.
1405660	1407660	There's just a hole there.
1407660	1416660	He is wearing high-heeled shoes and carrying two swords.
1416660	1422660	He's got a key ring on his belt and gravy all over his chin.
1422660	1425660	He gives you a very intimidating look.
1425660	1433660	You remember once he looks at you as your memory comes back that this is the guy that
1433660	1434660	sentenced you.
1434660	1437660	His name is Judge Doom.
1437660	1438660	Oh, no.
1438660	1444660	Don't look at that lock, thief, or I'll put you in a cell that you'll never get out of.
1444660	1445660	What?
1445660	1446660	Why?
1446660	1447660	What cell?
1447660	1448660	What cell?
1448660	1450660	It's a cell called death.
1450660	1451660	Glad you asked.
1451660	1454660	I thought that's where you were headed, but I wasn't sure.
1454660	1462660	Also, we do have strictly harder to get out of cells here, but that's for A-class criminals.
1462660	1464660	You don't deserve it.
1464660	1465660	Oh, shit.
1465660	1467660	You're pieces of shit, all of you.
1467660	1471660	You don't come into sitopolis and act the way you acted last night.
1471660	1472660	How was that?
1473660	1476660	I don't owe you any...
1476660	1483660	Oh, I do owe you answers.
1483660	1492660	You know, you were acting all fucking badass and talking about where's the squid, where's
1492660	1493660	the squid ink.
1493660	1496660	We don't have to tell you that.
1496660	1499660	If you don't know where the squid ink is, then you're an outsider.
1499660	1503660	If you're asking about squid ink and you're an outsider, that means you're an investigator.
1503660	1506660	Sitopolis doesn't like being investigated for its squid ink.
1506660	1509660	I can't believe I'm talking about this so much.
1509660	1516660	As he's saying that, he reaches in a pouch and you guys see that there's this little
1516660	1519660	tiny creature he pulls out of a pouch.
1519660	1523660	It looks very squid-like, and he squeezes it.
1523660	1527660	You all need to save for mental magic.
1527660	1528660	Oh, no.
1528660	1529660	Okay.
1529660	1530660	All right.
1530660	1531660	Okay.
1531660	1534660	A trace butt?
1534660	1535660	Yeah.
1535660	1536660	Trace butt.
1536660	1541660	Your thief instincts make you dodge to the side and hold your breath.
1541660	1547660	This isn't your first time at the gas attack rodeo.
1547660	1552660	But Tom, Tom, Tom, and shit, what was it?
1552660	1553660	Lars.
1553660	1554660	Lars.
1554660	1559660	Both of you guys inhale this weird, greasy, inky cloud of gas.
1559660	1564660	Your minds are like, you can't control your thoughts anymore.
1564660	1568660	You start thinking weird shit about it.
1568660	1570660	You see an image of a ship.
1570660	1575660	You see a mountain with a church on top of it.
1575660	1581660	Then you see inside the church, ostensibly, although you don't know.
1582660	1587660	You're just using the kind of Eisenstein principles of establishing shots with your memories.
1587660	1592660	It could be the inside of a completely different church, but you saw a church, and now you're
1592660	1597660	seeing the inside of a church, and it's a flash image, and you see blood filling the
1597660	1601660	church, and you see this judged doom at the front of it laughing.
1601660	1607660	Then you black out relative to you, Trace Butt.
1607660	1610660	These guys, they fall down, and they're unconscious.
1610660	1615660	Then they don't wake up for at least an hour, so if there's things you want to do while
1615660	1618660	they're asleep...
1618660	1619660	So what's the judge doing then?
1619660	1620660	Is he still hanging out?
1620660	1621660	He walks away.
1621660	1622660	Okay.
1622660	1623660	I mean, you know what?
1623660	1624660	I should...
1624660	1626660	I mean, he...
1626660	1627660	Okay.
1627660	1628660	He can.
1628660	1634660	Well, now, he notices that it doesn't affect you, that it didn't take with you.
1634660	1635660	I'm holding my breath.
1635660	1636660	Yeah.
1637660	1639660	And then he's like, nah, you're not worth it.
1639660	1640660	And he walks away.
1640660	1641660	Sorry.
1641660	1642660	It's all right.
1642660	1643660	It's fine.
1643660	1648660	Gotta go refill this squid now.
1648660	1650660	Shit, man.
1650660	1659660	And he walks about 10 feet down a hallway lined with stone, wet stone, and he goes through
1659660	1660660	what you can hear...
1660660	1665660	You can't see it from here, but you're using your thief casing instincts to notice that
1665660	1669660	there's actually a very large wooden door with many locks on it.
1669660	1675500	All of them remaining unlocked, but you can just hear the clanging and your thief ears
1675500	1676500	are going like...
1676500	1677500	Right.
1677500	1678500	There's a lot of fucking locks on that door.
1678500	1681500	And I'm trying to count as steps, too, to look at distances.
1681500	1691020	You put that door at about 30 feet away from the cell door, just around a kind of jagged
1691020	1695660	corner as if there's like...
1695660	1700220	So all you know is that there's a hallway, and then it comes around, and then there's
1700220	1701380	this cell.
1701380	1703780	There's no cells next to it.
1703780	1706980	And then there's that hallway that would...
1706980	1710600	It ends at a dead end right out in front of your cell.
1710600	1712740	There's a table there with candles on it.
1712740	1718260	There's a torch above that, a weird redundancy.
1718260	1722740	And there's some stuff on the table.
1722740	1725620	But is there anything in the cell or anything?
1725620	1734740	The cell has two benches and no windows.
1734740	1735740	Okay.
1735740	1738700	So I don't have any tools or anything, because I'm prison.
1738700	1740820	Yeah, no.
1740820	1747880	You guys are wearing burlap robes there, it seemed like standard issue.
1747880	1750520	But Lars and I are still asleep for an hour, right?
1750520	1751520	Yeah.
1751520	1752520	So you did all that to do...
1752520	1755440	I mean, I figured an hour is a long time for a thief, so if there's anything else you
1755440	1756440	want to know, I'm fine.
1756440	1760240	Well, I mean, I can't really try and pick the lock with my hands, I'd assume.
1760240	1761440	That'd be crazy.
1761440	1764600	I mean, you can...
1764600	1765600	You try to...
1765600	1767320	Well, what if I...
1767320	1770160	Have we revealed what races we are?
1770160	1772000	I'm an orc warrior.
1772000	1774740	I'm an elf.
1774740	1779180	Can I be a warforged, a robot man?
1779180	1781880	Okay.
1781880	1782880	You do that.
1782880	1783880	How does this...
1783880	1785580	Do I sound like a robot?
1785580	1786580	Yeah.
1786580	1787580	Okay.
1787580	1799520	You're a warforged, a crazy intricate clockwork man from a strange realm.
1799520	1804700	You're made of metal and things, so you do have powers that other humans don't have,
1804700	1806180	even when you're naked.
1806180	1812260	Can I like try and take my finger off to make it a lock picker?
1812260	1820500	You do that and you successfully are functioning, but you're unable to pick this lock with your
1820500	1822460	finger lock there.
1822460	1823460	Damn.
1823460	1829780	Only for the time being, though, it's just a failure in that sense.
1829780	1834820	The door immediately, as soon as you start even looking at that lock, let alone picking
1834820	1841380	at it, that door opens again and Judge Doom comes back and he goes, like, what the hell
1841380	1842380	are you doing?
1842380	1844420	I told you the first time not to fuck with that lock.
1844420	1845420	Oh, yeah.
1845420	1846420	No, I'm...
1846420	1847420	Not yeah.
1847420	1848420	I...
1848420	1849420	You got me.
1849420	1853820	What are you doing with your finger?
1853820	1856260	Oh, no, no.
1856260	1857660	This is just normal.
1858380	1861180	Oh, man, you must have really broke my finger.
1861180	1864100	You know how these models can be.
1864100	1865100	Yeah.
1865100	1868860	Well, that's totally convincing.
1868860	1873180	Doesn't matter anyway.
1873180	1875900	You're all food for the mother hen.
1875900	1877900	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
1877900	1878900	And he walks away.
1878900	1879900	All right.
1879900	1880900	Well, can I...
1880900	1881900	I wait for it to walk away, I guess.
1881900	1884900	And then can I try and wake people up, these guys up?
1884900	1896340	You successfully wake Tom, Tom, Tom up earlier than he would have woken up, whereas Lars
1896340	1897420	continues to sleep.
1897420	1902460	The exact duration of the effect of the squid ink.
1902460	1904020	I don't know what to do, you guys.
1904020	1907260	I feel like, you know, we could just wait it out.
1907260	1912420	No, we'll get fed to the hen and you're asleep.
1912420	1915180	I have a...
1915180	1919300	I have sensed a weakness in one of the walls in this cell.
1919300	1923460	That would be crazy.
1923460	1926260	He successfully convinces you that that's true.
1926260	1927940	That's awesome.
1927940	1930060	What else do you see?
1930060	1941700	I use metal punch and I punch the west wall of it because I've been scratching it like
1941700	1945380	writing, like, ticking off the days that we've been there.
1945380	1949420	And I feel like the plaster or whatever they've used to make that wall is a little weaker
1949420	1950540	than the other walls.
1950540	1951660	And I use metal punch.
1951660	1953540	Oh, I believe in him.
1953540	1954540	Yes.
1954540	1957700	And I give it everything I have.
1957700	1959700	You hurt your hand.
1959700	1960700	Lars.
1960700	1962260	You got this.
1962260	1963260	Keep it up.
1963260	1964940	Lars, you are now awake.
1964940	1965940	Whoa.
1965940	1969060	I had a dream about a bloody church.
1969060	1970060	Holy shit.
1970060	1971060	Tell me about that.
1971060	1972060	Has Lars been a robot?
1972060	1974820	Yeah, but no one paid attention.
1974820	1976420	Oh, okay.
1976420	1982660	When he mentions that bloody church, Trace, but because you didn't sleep and because he
1982660	1986340	had the image you started, you're putting something together.
1986340	1990900	You feel like maybe you actually know these guys, that you remember that you came to this
1990900	1997060	town together and that you were coming here for some reason that had to do...
1997060	2003180	Because when he says bloody church, you're like, whoa, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.
2003180	2005460	Why are we coming here?
2005460	2011620	You guys hear a distant crowd cheering, like it's so distant that they might have been
2011620	2015220	there the whole time doing things other than cheering, but now they're cheering so loud
2015220	2017380	that you hear them for the first time.
2017380	2021300	Oh, shit.
2021300	2026620	The door opens, same door as before, and Judge Dune comes walking down.
2026620	2030940	He goes, all right, you fox.
2030940	2033500	You're ready to feed the hen?
2033500	2034500	No.
2034500	2041060	Well, you wouldn't make good hen food if you were ready.
2041060	2047700	Smiggles, diggles, get in here.
2047700	2056500	These squid-headed priests come in and they're wearing robes.
2056500	2060060	They kind of look like...
2060060	2070820	Tom, Tom, Tom, you recognize them as mind flayers, they're psychic monsters, sentient
2070820	2071820	though.
2071820	2078660	They're not monsters in the sense that they can't vote and stuff, they're people, they
2078660	2085140	just look horrible and they like to kill people.
2085140	2086140	We shouldn't judge them.
2086140	2091940	I mean, they're probably the heroes of their own stories.
2091940	2100260	But their orcs are terrified of them because they're particularly susceptible to their
2100260	2105820	psychic attacks, but you're not operating at a penalty or anything like that.
2105820	2108300	But you know they can fuck you up.
2108300	2112820	So Judge Dune is like, all right, fox, it's time.
2112820	2119260	And he nods at one of the mind flayer guys and they gesture at the lock and it clicks
2119260	2121580	and the cell door opens.
2121580	2122580	It opens wide.
2122580	2126700	It opens wide as a cell door can open.
2126700	2128020	You're now in an open cell.
2128020	2129420	What do you guys wanna do?
2129540	2130540	Should we run for it?
2130540	2131540	I'll defer.
2131540	2135780	Can we run for it?
2135780	2137940	I think we run for it, but we run together.
2137940	2140900	How many mind flayers are there?
2140900	2141900	How many?
2141900	2142900	Oh, there's two.
2142900	2143900	Oh man.
2143900	2144900	There's just two and Judge Dune.
2144900	2146700	He can see you guys thinking about running.
2146700	2149300	I'm gonna hide in the corner.
2149300	2151300	You're gonna, in the cell?
2151300	2152900	Yeah.
2152900	2157660	You do a passable job of hiding in the corner of the cell.
2157740	2158740	I know you're over there.
2158740	2160980	I'm not involved in this.
2160980	2164940	It's pretty impressive how concealed you are over there.
2164940	2168780	Thank you for showing me your skills.
2168780	2170260	I'm glad you're in there.
2170260	2171260	Yeah.
2171260	2174220	Do we have any inventory or just our prison garb?
2174220	2176380	You're just wearing burlap sacks.
2176380	2182780	You have what's called a holdout dagger in your rectum.
2182780	2191700	It's very dull, but it's like you come from a tribe of warriors at puberty that was inserted.
2191700	2194980	It stays up there for most of your life.
2194980	2199340	It's honestly more of a ceremony.
2199340	2206580	I take my holdout dagger out of my rectum and also use my, I sharpened a toothbrush
2206580	2209100	over time while I was there.
2209100	2210100	Oh wow.
2210100	2213380	Two-hand fight attack on one of the guards.
2213380	2215020	I'm a two-hand fighter.
2215020	2219580	I can't let you pretend that you created a toothbrush.
2219580	2220940	I'm not gonna let you do that.
2220940	2224500	It's been one night.
2224500	2225500	Is that metagaming?
2225500	2226500	To have created a toothbrush?
2226500	2227500	Yeah.
2227500	2228900	You can't just say, by the way, I did this.
2228900	2232020	Although, I'm giving you a little latitude because you don't have character sheets and
2232020	2235500	stuff like that, but I'm calling the toothbrush out of bounds.
2235500	2236500	It's fucking bullshit.
2236500	2237500	Okay, okay.
2237500	2238500	I take bullshit.
2238500	2245780	I take my out of bounds dagger out of my butt and put it like, like, I kind of, like,
2245780	2251580	Well, hold on, because it's one action to do that, and I rolled for it, and you do such
2251580	2253740	a bad job of ... Oh no.
2253740	2258220	But it's actually kind of good news because you're doing such a bad job of getting the
2258220	2265820	dagger out of your ass that you just, he doesn't know you have one yet, so you're just digging
2265820	2272500	all the way up your ass, and it looks like you're ... He's like, ugh, orcs.
2272500	2276340	Yeah, perfect, that plays right to my ... He is racist.
2276340	2279460	I am racist.
2279460	2285260	I hate all races, and then you see him look over at one of his mind flayers who didn't
2285260	2290380	seem to react, but he's like, he's like, whatever.
2290380	2293220	Identity politics.
2293220	2296780	I hate identity politics.
2296780	2299500	I hate identity politics.
2299500	2302940	He keeps saying it because he's not ... He wants to get a rise out of people, I guess.
2302940	2303940	Do I see ... Oh.
2303940	2307220	He really thinks it means something.
2307220	2309940	I hate identity politics.
2309940	2312260	Do I see Tom Tom pull out his dagger, or try to pull out his dagger?
2312260	2313660	He hasn't done it yet.
2313660	2318300	No, yeah, you just see the same thing that everybody else saw, which is like, this orc
2318300	2323180	is just digging in his butt, like he's like his own puppet.
2324180	2328780	Your hand is still up your ass, so I would actually let you take another try at it.
2328780	2331700	I believe in you.
2331700	2335380	I pretend that I am asleep.
2335380	2338620	You'd remove your hand from your ass?
2338620	2339620	No, no.
2339620	2345820	I pretend that I'm an orc who put my hand up his own butt, and then he'd go, ugh.
2345820	2347740	Like the chimpanzee in the video.
2347740	2349820	I passed out.
2349820	2352980	I'm playing possum right now.
2352980	2355740	No sleeping, get up.
2355740	2360300	You feel a stab of otherworldly pain in your frontal lobe.
2360300	2362300	Oh, shit.
2362300	2364500	You got psychic attacked.
2364500	2366700	I got psychic attacked.
2366700	2368940	It's searing pain in your brain.
2368940	2372260	But I have a constitution of 21.
2372260	2375940	Well, that doesn't matter.
2375940	2376940	Still hurts.
2376940	2380820	But, you know, I care less about it.
2380820	2385180	I'm just a sleepy orc with a hand up his own butt.
2385180	2390500	A creepy voice whispers in your brain, there will be more pain.
2390500	2393220	Let's just go with these guys.
2393220	2400860	You hear a voice from a mostly concealed shadow in the corner of the cell saying that.
2400860	2405020	I trust them.
2405020	2408340	I cast Inflict Light Wounds on one of the mind flayers.
2408340	2409340	Oh, shit.
2409340	2411780	Oh, man.
2411780	2416380	You have positioned yourself as a harmless man in a burlap sack when secretly you have
2416380	2418820	the power of the ancient holies.
2418820	2424220	You now lay your hands upon the nearest mind flayer and it reacts with searing pain as
2424220	2435420	you cook it like so much calamari.
2435420	2441140	The mind flayer falls back to the wall spewing blood from its nose which is underneath its
2441140	2442140	tentacle mouth.
2442140	2445460	But you assume there's a nose under there and there's blood coming out.
2445460	2446460	Holy shit.
2446460	2450260	I think we could win.
2450260	2455180	And you're next if you don't back off.
2455180	2458660	Judge Doom's like fucking psychic squid people.
2458660	2461620	Do you want something done right?
2461620	2469660	He comes at Lars with drawing his swords.
2469660	2473140	He's doing a two-sword attack.
2473140	2474820	Oh, shit.
2474820	2483180	He misses with one and kind of grazes your arm with the other doing a moderate amount
2483180	2485540	of damage just to your arm.
2485540	2490260	So it's not that big a deal in the grand scheme because it's like if your arm was a body,
2490260	2494060	it would have been hit in its arm.
2494060	2497540	Your arm's arm is hurt, but you're okay.
2497540	2501020	Jeff, what have you got?
2501020	2505300	I go at them with a, like, because I have no weapons right now except the thing.
2505300	2510780	You're laying on the prison cell with a hand up your ass.
2510780	2513700	You want to roll dice to see if I successfully pull my weapon?
2513700	2514700	Sure.
2514700	2515700	That's what you want.
2515700	2516700	Oh, yeah.
2516700	2519460	You whip it out like a fucking, like a Kleenex out of a box.
2519460	2525500	So I take out my secret poop weapon and describe it for me.
2525500	2535580	It's a short, rather blunt four and a half inch ceremonial dagger that was inserted into
2535580	2542300	your asshole when you turned 12 in your orc village.
2542300	2549840	It was sharper back then, but it was never so sharp that it tore flesh.
2549840	2555780	So it's really like, it's a weapon that is mostly used by the elders of your tribe to
2555780	2563340	terrorize the children because adolescent orcs are very difficult to manage.
2563340	2569500	So they have these rituals that they use to focus your aggression on the outside world.
2569500	2575060	So I use weapon focus and throw it at the, at what's his name?
2575060	2576060	Judge Doom?
2576060	2577060	Judge Doom.
2577060	2578060	Okay.
2578060	2582500	I will tell you that he will make a worse target because, again, this is a very blunt
2582500	2583620	knife.
2583620	2589260	I'll just tell you that, like, if your lore in your tribe understands it, in the few stories
2589260	2596020	where an orc actually has to use these things, the most effective use of them is as an assist
2596020	2601780	in melee, like a punching, because it's so dull, but it's sharper than a fist.
2601780	2602780	Okay.
2602780	2607100	So I do, because I'm generally like a two handed fighter.
2607100	2611260	I would let you throw it, but I'm just recommending you don't throw it at a guy with any armor,
2611260	2613980	but the mind flayers are just squid people in robes.
2613980	2616180	I appreciate your advice.
2616180	2622940	I come at with a chop to the throat and a stab with my blunt poop weapon into his mid
2622940	2623940	section.
2623940	2625460	Oh, you karate chop with one hand.
2625460	2627860	Like, throat mid section with the boots.
2627860	2629300	And this is on Judge Doom, huh?
2629300	2630300	On Judge Doom itself.
2630300	2631300	It's very self.
2631300	2632300	All right.
2632300	2642220	Well, your chop goes wide, and then your blunt stab misses.
2642220	2643220	I'm sorry.
2643220	2646540	I want it to, I want you to be rolling better.
2646540	2648420	It's hard.
2648420	2650820	So you miss.
2650820	2651820	It's okay.
2651820	2652820	I was groggy.
2652820	2653820	I just woke up from a little nap.
2654820	2659380	Can I launch myself at the mind flayer hoping to tackle his head?
2659380	2662140	Yes.
2662140	2667740	It's not a critical fail, but you do a poor job of leaping from the shadowy corner.
2667740	2669740	My plan.
2669740	2670740	Yeah.
2670740	2671740	Yeah.
2671740	2679820	The robot thief kind of clumsily jangles out of the corner and lands at the feet of the
2679820	2680820	mind flayer.
2680820	2681820	See, it was a trick.
2681820	2682820	I was on your side.
2683820	2686820	Now you guys are going to die.
2686820	2688820	Shut up back there.
2688820	2690820	Oh, no.
2690820	2691820	Nobody grabs that torch.
2691820	2693820	Keep the torch safe.
2693820	2694820	Grab the torch.
2694820	2695820	Guard the torch with your lives.
2695820	2696820	Grab the torch.
2696820	2697820	Oh, God.
2697820	2704820	One of the mind flayers, you see him squint and look at Tom, Tom, Tom, but nothing happens.
2704820	2705820	Oh, shit.
2705820	2711820	He must have remembered his ex-girlfriend or something.
2711820	2712820	Quick thinking.
2712820	2714820	And let's see.
2714820	2715820	Oh, shit.
2715820	2723820	Well, the other mind flayer, he's massively wounded and against the wall, but you see
2723820	2724820	him doing something.
2724820	2726820	It looks like he's healing himself.
2726820	2727820	Oh, no.
2727820	2729820	It's some kind of psychic thing.
2729820	2738820	Judge Doom, he does a really good job of attacking Tom, Tom, Tom.
2738820	2739820	What?
2739820	2742820	What's my HP currently right now?
2742820	2743820	Full.
2743820	2744820	40.
2744820	2745820	40?
2745820	2746820	Yeah.
2746820	2748820	But you better subtract seven from that.
2748820	2749820	Oh, damn.
2749820	2750820	Okay.
2750820	2751820	All right.
2751820	2752820	You guys can go.
2752820	2754820	I'd start with Tom, Tom, Tom.
2754820	2755820	Okay.
2755820	2757820	I do power attack at...
2757820	2760820	Who am I closest to right now?
2760820	2763820	You are closest to Judge Doom.
2764820	2767820	Power attack, and I just go for a strangle.
2767820	2772820	I use all of my arm strength and just go straight to try to choke him out.
2772820	2773820	Okay.
2773820	2781820	You grab his throat with the efficiency of an animal at bay.
2781820	2782820	Nice.
2782820	2787820	From the stories of animals with hands from your childhood.
2787820	2793500	Your hands go to his throat as if guided by special magnets in a novelty sculpture of
2793500	2802500	someone choking someone, and your thumbs find his windpipe with magic-like efficiency.
2802500	2803500	Nice.
2803500	2806500	You realize you have his life at your mercy.
2806500	2810500	You need only squeeze to snuff him out.
2810500	2811500	Power attack.
2811500	2812500	Squeeze that shit.
2812500	2813500	Yeah.
2813500	2814500	It's all right.
2814500	2816500	You crush his windpipe.
2816500	2817500	He can't breathe.
2817500	2819500	Even if you let go, he can't breathe.
2819500	2822500	He's so sad and in such pain.
2822500	2823500	Oh, no.
2829500	2832500	This is what your actions hath wrought.
2835500	2839500	He's crawling to you, Lars, like...
2841500	2845500	Aligned with demons and live in torturous agony.
2846500	2847500	What did you say, Spencer?
2847500	2850500	I'm just punishing him verbally.
2853500	2856500	Oh, does he have any items that look stealable?
2856500	2857500	Oh, man.
2857500	2860500	He's got so many items.
2860500	2864500	There is one mind flayer left, but that was Tom Tom's Attack of Lars.
2864500	2865500	You can go.
2865500	2866500	Oh, I kick him.
2866500	2868500	You kick Judge Joom?
2868500	2869500	Yeah.
2869500	2870500	Well, I mean, it's an easy target.
2870500	2871500	Yeah, you kick him.
2871500	2875500	I mean, he's like, man, I'm dying and now I'm getting kicked.
2875500	2876500	Ha!
2876500	2878500	You see Trace Butte?
2878500	2879500	You want to do something?
2879500	2880500	Yeah.
2881500	2884500	Do I see any items on his person that I could immediately grab
2884500	2886500	within a short period of time?
2886500	2887500	Yeah.
2887500	2890500	His most visible objects are he has a pair of shimmering,
2890500	2894500	slightly glowing gloves made of a very fine chainmail
2894500	2897500	that are draped over his belt.
2897500	2902500	He has an extra sword on the back, He-Man style.
2902500	2908500	He's got those fox pelts that you notice upon closer inspection.
2909500	2912500	The eyes have a kind of life to them.
2912500	2913500	Yeah.
2913500	2914500	That's cool as shit.
2914500	2915500	Yeah.
2915500	2918500	I mean, they don't just look like regular dead foxes.
2918500	2920500	They look like maybe they're living pelts.
2920500	2921500	Okay.
2921500	2927500	Can I take the sword and throw it to Tom Tom Tom?
2927500	2932500	You grab the sword off the back of the dying man
2932500	2936500	and the robot thief flings you this sword.
2936500	2937500	Do you want to try to catch it?
2937500	2938500	Yeah.
2938500	2939500	I try to catch the sword.
2939500	2943500	You do so with like a globe trotter.
2943500	2944500	Hell yeah.
2944500	2945500	I'm going to go grab a coke.
2945500	2946500	I'll be right back.
2946500	2947500	I can't...
2947500	2948500	Can I...
2948500	2950500	Where's Spencer go?
2950500	2951500	He's achieved his dream.
2951500	2952500	He's leaving.
2952500	2953500	Okay.
2953500	2958500	I catch the sword and I try to use the momentum of catching the sword
2958500	2961500	and swing around and kill the final mind flayer.
2961500	2962500	Okay.
2962500	2963500	And a cleave.
2963500	2964500	I use cleave.
2964500	2966500	It's a critical hit!
2966500	2967500	Yeah!
2967500	2968500	Whoo!
2968500	2969500	Whoo!
2969500	2970500	Whoo!
2970500	2971500	Whoo!
2971500	2972500	Whoo!
2972500	2973500	Whoo!
2973500	2974500	Whoo!
2974500	2975500	Whoo!
2975500	2979500	Also, this sword has like some strange magic properties.
2979500	2982500	You hear a voice in your head as you strike saying,
2982500	2985500	Aaah, flesh.
2985500	2988500	And there's like the wound that you cause
2988500	2994500	as you cleave the other mind flayer in half at his hips.
2994500	2995500	Damn.
2995500	3002160	The wound is cauterized with a strange orange glow, but it's not a healthy thing because
3002160	3004440	it starts to eat the flesh away.
3004440	3010560	The body continues to start disintegrating in both halves as you watch it.
3010560	3017760	You'd still have time to grab any, like his robes, but he's slowly just disappearing.
3017760	3020280	So have we vanquished everybody inside this room right now?
3020280	3021280	Yeah, you've got to show...
3022080	3025640	Oh, the other mind flayer is like he was healing himself.
3025640	3026640	Oh yeah, no.
3026640	3029480	He's at a disadvantage.
3029480	3030840	He's only just alive.
3030840	3031840	Trace butt!
3031840	3032840	Trace butt!
3032840	3033840	Finish the job!
3033840	3034840	What about you?
3034840	3035840	Oh, of ours.
3035840	3038320	I cast Scorching Ray at the last mind flayer.
3038320	3039320	Whoa, what are you...
3039320	3042600	What's your god?
3042600	3043600	In a good way.
3043600	3044600	Can we...
3044600	3045600	Can we not talk...
3045600	3046600	Religion.
3046600	3047600	It's like...
3048400	3049400	Politics.
3049400	3057160	Linking your thumbs together and fanning your fingers out in a manual display of the symbolness.
3057160	3062460	Flames shoot from your fingertips in a fan-like pattern, dancing through the air and connecting
3062460	3065840	with the face and genitals of the mind flayer.
3065840	3070720	He shrieks in agony through all of your brains, trying as hard as he can to hurt you with
3070720	3071720	his thoughts.
3071720	3077080	But all he successfully does is share with you what he's thinking as he dies.
3077080	3084120	Which is, oh god, Daphne, oh, why was I such a dick, I was gaslighting.
3084120	3087240	That's what they call gaslighting, is what I was doing to her.
3087240	3089240	And he dies.
3089240	3092240	Damn.
3092240	3093520	Nice job, guys.
3093520	3095240	I loot the bodies.
3095240	3099280	You find yourselves wondering, what was that relationship about?
3099280	3100280	Lies.
3100280	3102480	I feel kind of bad.
3102480	3103480	Yeah.
3103480	3107880	Okay, so yeah, I mean, he's technically alive, Judge Doom, but he's not...
3107880	3108880	Oh.
3108880	3109880	He's not gonna...
3109880	3110880	Finish him off, man.
3110880	3113040	He's not gonna continue living and he can barely speak.
3113040	3114440	He's turning purple, he's dying.
3114440	3119080	I walk up to him and say, what did you have against us in the first place?
3119080	3125000	I give him a pen and paper.
3125000	3137720	Can I heal him, like, a little bit, just so we can talk to him a little bit, or...
3137720	3140200	Okay, you use, like, cure light wounds?
3140200	3141200	Okay.
3141200	3142200	You do that.
3142200	3145400	You cure just a tip of his light wounds.
3145400	3152040	That's what I was saying.
3152040	3155720	I was saying air, because I couldn't breathe.
3155720	3156720	Right.
3156720	3159120	What did you have against us in the first place?
3159120	3161320	I ain't trying to grapple him, I guess.
3161320	3162320	You try what?
3162320	3163320	To grapple him.
3163320	3164320	Oh, you grapple him.
3164320	3165320	Okay.
3165320	3166320	I mean, you've got him security.
3166320	3167320	He's not gonna...
3167320	3168320	Okay, great.
3168320	3169320	You did a good job of...
3169320	3170320	He just...
3170320	3173440	He focused his healing on his trachea so that he could speak.
3173440	3174440	But he's like...
3174440	3181880	You've even done a kind of cruel thing, where he's able to draw in, like, 5% less
3181880	3185720	oxygen with each breath that it will take in totality to keep him alive.
3185720	3189800	So he's, like, still in a perpetual state of suffocation.
3189800	3190800	It's like waterboarding.
3190800	3191800	He's like...
3191800	3198600	It would be called simulated death, but he's actually dying.
3198600	3199600	You're torturing him.
3199600	3200600	He's tortured.
3200600	3201600	Are we the bad guys?
3201600	3202600	No, no.
3202600	3203600	We're good.
3203600	3204600	I think he's...
3204600	3205600	Well, I mean, I can't judge.
3205600	3206600	I'm a dungeon master.
3206600	3211840	But I don't think anyone that imprisons somebody without due process is a very good person.
3211840	3215680	And, truly, anyone who allies with mind flayers needs to be killed.
3215680	3217680	And he did call you fuck faces and stuff.
3217680	3219280	He was mean, you know?
3219280	3221280	He didn't tell you why you were here.
3221280	3222280	Oh, God.
3222280	3223280	Oh, God.
3223280	3226280	I want to die, but I don't want to live like this.
3226280	3228280	I poke out his eye.
3228280	3229280	What?
3229280	3231280	I poke out his eye.
3231280	3232280	Ah!
3232280	3235920	The robot pokes out his eye with his metal finger.
3235920	3236920	Ah!
3236920	3237920	Ah!
3237920	3238920	Ah!
3238920	3239920	Ah!
3239920	3240920	Ah!
3240920	3241920	Ah!
3241920	3242920	Ah!
3242920	3243920	Dude, please stop.
3243920	3244920	Please don't torture me anymore.
3244920	3245920	I hate dying in pain.
3245920	3246920	I don't...
3246920	3247920	If you're gonna kill me, please kill me.
3247920	3256520	If you're not gonna kill me, please heal me more so I can live.
3256520	3263880	I pick him up by the ankle and hold him upside down and look...
3263880	3268600	I'm trying to get him, like, eye to eye, but my arm isn't long enough.
3268600	3272960	So, like, I keep scooting my hand up, like, I have him by the belt now.
3272960	3278120	He's upside down, but I have him by the belt, so now he's upside down and we're eye to eye.
3278120	3279120	Ah!
3279120	3280880	And I say, where is the squid ink?
3280880	3281880	Ah!
3281880	3284840	It's in my pouch on my belt!
3284840	3285840	You know that?
3285840	3287840	How would I know that?
3287840	3289840	I used it on you!
3289840	3290960	Is that what you want?
3290960	3294880	I take the squid ink out of his pouch.
3294880	3297120	There's a pouch on his belt that's, like, writhing around.
3297120	3298120	You remember that.
3298640	3301640	Maybe you don't remember, maybe you're a better role player than I am a DM.
3301640	3302640	Oh, shit.
3302640	3308200	Because you have a faint memory of, he's got a little wriggling squid in that, in that
3308200	3309200	bag.
3309200	3310200	Yeah, I shot you with brain juice.
3310200	3313080	And he squeeze it, it's like a knockout drug or something like that.
3313080	3314760	I put it in his mouth.
3314760	3316440	Wait, hold on to that.
3316440	3317800	That could be useful.
3317800	3319880	My rogue mind tells me.
3319880	3320880	Okay.
3320880	3322040	Good thinking, Trace Butt.
3322040	3324440	I give Trace Butt the pouch of squid ink.
3324440	3325440	Oh, thanks.
3325440	3327760	You have a squid ink of knockout.
3327760	3331120	A squid, a baby squid of knockout.
3331120	3333920	I guess I grab his keys.
3333920	3335640	You grab his keys.
3335640	3337840	Is there anything on that desk that's relevant?
3337840	3345160	The desk contains six candles, two hats, and a drawer.
3345160	3347160	Take these hats.
3347160	3352880	One hat is, like, a tall hat, like, a two foot tall hat.
3352880	3356400	I take off, what's his name?
3356400	3358160	Judge Doom?
3358160	3362600	I take off Judge Doom's outfit, like, I'm gonna, like, dress up like him to sneak out.
3362600	3365960	But then I just go, you know what, it's just funny if I leave him naked.
3365960	3368260	And I light his clothes on fire.
3368260	3369800	So he's now just naked.
3369800	3372400	You could have had him be naked and also take his clothes.
3372400	3374920	Yeah, but I don't want to, they don't fit.
3374920	3375920	Okay.
3375920	3379560	He's really sad because he's naked now and he's still, again, he's dying the whole time.
3379560	3380560	It's like a horrible death.
3380960	3383360	I give him two good berries.
3383360	3387800	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, thank you.
3387800	3390920	And then I smash him in the head and kill him.
3390920	3391920	Ah!
3391920	3392920	Ah!
3392920	3395400	Where'd you get good berries?
3395400	3397720	Up my butt.
3397720	3402840	They were in the secret compartment in the hilt of the anal dagger, yeah.
3402840	3403840	Yeah.
3403840	3404840	That's some good thinking.
3404840	3405840	No, it is.
3405840	3410520	It's like a beautiful, I'll tell you, the ritual that is Ork Village practices is
3411040	3412040	in its roots.
3412040	3416760	It's actually a really wonderful thing, but it's just become so corrupted and it's just
3416760	3417760	about oppression.
3417760	3418760	Right.
3418760	3421680	Like it's really just about scaring kids.
3421680	3424840	Are there other prisoners in this jail cell?
3424840	3425840	No.
3425840	3428840	Let's make tracks.
3428840	3429840	What's that?
3429840	3430840	Let's get out of here.
3430840	3433000	Oh, the robot says let's get out of here.
3433000	3434000	Yeah.
3434000	3435400	So we look for the exit.
3435400	3436400	You guys took those hats?
3436400	3437400	Yeah.
3437400	3438400	We got two hats.
3438400	3439400	We got two hats.
3439400	3440400	Okay.
3441280	3443280	I take the seven candles, too, just to keep the seven.
3443280	3444280	The quid.
3444280	3445280	Okay.
3445280	3446280	The candles are in your orksack.
3446280	3448720	Or, no, you don't have an orksack.
3448720	3452720	You just scoop them up in your arms and they kind of go out and burn you with wax, but
3452720	3454720	you're holding six candles.
3454720	3455720	Hell yeah.
3455720	3456920	All right.
3456920	3462560	You guys head around that hallway and there's an eight-foot tall, four-foot wide giant door
3462560	3466320	with six locks on it, but all of them are unfastened.
3466320	3467480	Oh, hell yeah.
3467480	3469120	This is our lucky day.
3469120	3470120	Yeah.
3470560	3473480	Let's continue onward.
3473480	3474720	Tracebot goes to the door.
3474720	3476120	You open it?
3476120	3477120	Yeah.
3477120	3478120	He opens the door.
3478120	3480040	Oh, I should have listened.
3480040	3482120	Behind the door is a room.
3482120	3485480	It's white with white walls and a white ceiling.
3485480	3487120	There's a hole in the ceiling.
3487120	3493320	That's a square below the square is a beechwood table, finely polished, containing all of
3493320	3499480	your items in three separate piles, one for each of you, each labeled with your name.
3500480	3509360	It's all your stuff, and beyond that, there's a door in the north wall that's oozing with
3509360	3512520	green slime.
3512520	3518600	It's got a little doorway, a little, what, a peaky patch in it.
3518600	3521760	And yeah, the room is lit by daylight.
3521760	3523280	That's a skylight above the door.
3523280	3524280	Nice.
3524280	3525280	All right.
3525280	3526280	Let's get our stuff.
3526280	3527280	Yeah, we all pick up our items.
3527280	3528280	Okay.
3528280	3530200	We all pick up our items.
3530200	3531200	You have them all.
3531200	3537520	I stand on top of the beechwood table and say, Lars, Tracebot, stand on my shoulders.
3537520	3543160	You get on top and climb out, and I will use my own strength to get myself here.
3543160	3545840	I'll be on the bottom because I'm the most sturdy.
3545840	3547240	I'll lock my joints.
3547240	3548720	All right.
3548720	3550080	So I get on top of Tracebot.
3550080	3552440	Lars, you want to climb on top of me?
3552440	3554560	Yeah, I climb up to the top, and I do it.
3554560	3556760	Can I reach the hole?
3556760	3560520	You can, yeah, if you're on top of Tom Thomas, you're climbing on Tom Thomas.
3560520	3561520	Yeah.
3561520	3562520	Yeah.
3562520	3563520	You can reach the hole.
3563520	3566080	There's sand above it.
3566080	3569160	It's like a hole to a beach.
3569160	3570160	Is it big enough for me to fit through?
3570160	3571160	Oh, yeah.
3571160	3573240	It's like a three-foot square hole.
3573240	3576480	I climb up and look for a rope to hand down to my friends.
3576480	3577480	Okay.
3577480	3582120	You pull yourself up with Cleric, like agility.
3582120	3583120	It's a sunlit beach.
3583120	3584760	It's actually quite beautiful.
3584760	3586440	There's an ocean.
3586440	3592360	It's a crystal-clear blue ocean, and yeah, you pull yourself up.
3592360	3598720	You hear seagulls and a strange distant sound that you've never heard before in the distance.
3598720	3604440	It's just a strange humming or something.
3604440	3611880	There's a big forest and a road made of pebbles.
3611880	3615680	By the way, that's how they make all roads that you remember.
3615680	3619760	Maybe some form of pebble refinement.
3619760	3621240	You're looking for a rope or something?
3621240	3625400	Do we have ropes in our stuff?
3625400	3626400	Say what?
3626400	3627400	Do we have ropes in our stuff?
3627400	3628400	Yeah.
3628400	3630240	You each have 50 feet of rope, because everyone does.
3630240	3631240	Yeah.
3631240	3632240	Classic.
3632240	3633240	I throw you the rope.
3633240	3634240	Okay.
3634240	3635240	Robot throws a rope up.
3635240	3636800	I find a tree to tie it around.
3636800	3638720	Well, just hold it.
3638720	3639720	How heavy are you?
3639720	3640720	Okay.
3640720	3641720	Do a tree.
3641720	3642720	Okay.
3642720	3643720	I tie around a tree.
3643720	3644720	What are you doing?
3644760	3645760	I'm trying to ask.
3645760	3650000	Are you having the cleric pull you up?
3650000	3652000	He's looking for a tree to tie the rope around.
3652000	3653000	Yeah.
3653000	3654000	You should probably find a tree.
3654000	3655000	You're made of metal.
3655000	3656000	Or like a big rock.
3656000	3657000	All right.
3657000	3658000	So I'm on top of Trace Butts, so I climb up the rope.
3658000	3659000	All right.
3659000	3662000	You do that.
3662000	3664000	You're up.
3664000	3665600	You also hear this strange sound.
3665600	3667840	It's getting louder now than when you first came out.
3667840	3668840	It's like...
3668840	3669840	It's like...
3669840	3670840	So you pull...
3670840	3680560	But you both manage to find a rock.
3680560	3684560	You secure the rope to it, and you pull Trace Butt up.
3684560	3685560	Hell yeah.
3685560	3686560	The sound keeps coming.
3686560	3687560	Oh, you guys.
3687560	3688560	You got it.
3688560	3689560	You got it.
3689560	3690560	You got it.
3690560	3693560	You got your hut.
3693560	3697480	When you're finally able to pinpoint the source of the sound, you look and you see the strangest
3698080	3699080	sight.
3699080	3706640	It's like a giant dragonfly made of armor and glass, but its wings are not wings at
3706640	3707640	all.
3707640	3711160	They're like javelins that are rotating around.
3711160	3712160	It's a helicopter.
3712160	3713680	Oh, no.
3713680	3716520	Your memories come flooding back to you when you see it.
3716520	3718640	The three of you met in Vietnam.
3718640	3722000	Oh, no.
3722000	3723080	You're having flashbacks.
3723080	3724960	You're remembering what happened to you.
3725280	3733040	You were part of an experimental drug torture operation adopted by the Viet Cong, financed
3733040	3735280	by the Soviet Union.
3735280	3744200	You were prisoners of war, and these things were dripped into your eyeballs, and that's
3744200	3745680	the last thing you remember.
3745680	3752200	But you now realize that your captain, Captain Danderpants, is in the helicopter, and your
3752200	3755840	pilot, Murdoch, is at the stick.
3755840	3757400	They're lowering a ladder now.
3757400	3758400	Get up here!
3758400	3760360	Get up here, you candy asses!
3760360	3761360	Come on!
3761360	3762360	Come on!
3762360	3763360	Get up!
3763360	3764360	Let's do it.
3764360	3767000	You guys run to the ladder.
3767000	3768880	You start climbing up.
3768880	3772840	You hear Captain Danderpants going, what the fuck happened to you?
3772840	3773840	What the fuck?
3773840	3774840	You're a robot?
3774840	3775840	What the fuck?
3775840	3776840	Oh, I don't know.
3776840	3777840	I guess.
3778840	3784880	Laura, since you have magic, like, detect magic on the helicopter?
3784880	3789920	Yeah, it's weird, because you feel like you've had this whole life as a cleric, and you don't
3789920	3793600	know what a helicopter is, but you have more memories from a life where you know what a
3793600	3796080	helicopter is.
3796080	3800520	You have more of a relationship with that identity, this soldier from Vietnam.
3800520	3802240	But I can detect magic still.
3802240	3804360	Yeah, you can, totally.
3804360	3806400	And there's no magic on this helicopter.
3806400	3807880	That's technological.
3807880	3809840	Oh, shit.
3809840	3815200	You feel the large part of you kind of receding, almost as if it requires you to believe it's
3815200	3819600	real in order to be real, but it's currently still pretty real, because you just spent
3819600	3821360	all this time in this jail cell.
3821360	3825040	But you also see this look on Captain Danderpants, his face.
3825040	3827720	He's looking at you guys, like he's actually deeply unsettled.
3827720	3834960	He recognizes your faces, but he did not expect to see what he's seeing.
3834960	3837080	What happened to us down there?
3837080	3838880	That's what I was going to ask you.
3838880	3841440	Get in this goddamn helicopter.
3841440	3851120	Come on, we can talk about it when we get to the DMT, C, D, the D, the drop zone.
3851120	3857920	Come on, you sons of bitches, don't fucking judge my lack of Vietnam jargon.
3857920	3860440	Let me finish.
3860440	3867560	I was in Marine boots when your mama's diapers were titty-fucking, your dad's cum.
3867560	3869600	I don't want to hear your shit.
3869600	3873520	It's hard to be a supervisor of soldiers like you.
3873520	3875240	It makes your mind slip.
3875240	3877120	It's been a strenuous war.
3877120	3880680	This country's fighting itself more than it's fighting the enemy.
3880680	3881680	We don't even know.
3881680	3883000	I'm all fucked up.
3883000	3888160	I got one job I focus on so I can get through the day without putting a gun in my mouth,
3888160	3893240	take care of my boys, and you're the hardest boys I ever had to take care of, and I love
3893240	3895680	the fuck out of you, but what the fuck happened to you?
3895680	3896680	You got turned into a robot?
3896680	3897680	Get in the helicopter.
3897680	3898680	Come on, Murdoch.
3898680	3899680	Go, go.
3899680	3906080	Murdoch's going like, shit, fuck, yeah, let's go.
3906080	3909400	He's like, the helicopter starts soaring.
3909400	3915240	There's a strange roaring sound you hear to your right.
3915240	3923200	You see a huge swarm of baby dragons is coming out of a palm tree.
3923200	3930000	The palm tree, there was a hinge on the giant palm tree, and a bunch of baby dragons came
3930000	3931000	out of it.
3931000	3938160	I turn over to Lars and Tracebutt and go, I think Captain Dandypass is on DMT right
3938160	3939160	now.
3939160	3940160	What?
3940160	3941160	Fuck you.
3941160	3942160	I heard that.
3942160	3946800	I'm not disrespectful, it is to dismiss what we're doing over here as some kind of drug
3946800	3947800	trip.
3947800	3949440	Why don't you just relax?
3949440	3952080	You're having a bad trip, man.
3952080	3953080	You're freaking out.
3953080	3954080	I'm having a bad trip.
3954080	3958320	You're the one that looks like a fucking pig monster in weird armor.
3958320	3960000	What the fuck happened to you, man?
3960000	3961000	We don't know.
3961000	3962240	Or do we know?
3962240	3964400	Well, you guys don't know.
3964400	3965400	I didn't think so.
3965400	3967760	I mean, you're just remembering that you were in Vietnam.
3967760	3968760	Right.
3968760	3971160	I mean, you share that with them, I assume.
3971160	3975240	You're like, yeah, just all I remember is being in Vietnam, but then we woke up in
3975240	3978320	the cell, but we kind of have these identities.
3978320	3979320	Yeah, yeah.
3979320	3982920	Yeah, so you kind of do your best to relay to him everything that you do know.
3982920	3986720	He's like, goddamn it, Project Omega is live!
3986720	3989440	We got to warn the president!
3989440	3993320	I cast guidance on Murdock so he can escape from the dragons.
3993320	3996280	Oh, that's nice of you, yeah.
3996280	3999000	You do a really good job.
3999000	4012240	So Lars, you're like, the best I can describe it is lactating mothers.
4012240	4018680	As you continue to breastfeed the casting of spells, you can tell that it's important
4018680	4026680	to keep, it keeps you remembering Lars' life and you're kind of in this weird halfway spot
4026680	4034120	where you're like half this Vietnam soldier named Diggins and half Lars.
4034120	4035120	I remember.
4035120	4037740	But you're able to cast the spell, it very clearly works.
4037740	4041480	You guys see like magic energy come out of his hands, Captain Dandy Pants is like, what
4041480	4042480	the fuck?
4042480	4043480	What is that?
4043480	4044480	Commie energy?
4044480	4049440	Holy shit, your fucking hand's got pink shit coming out of it!
4049440	4054760	But it clearly makes Murdock a magnificent pilot and he flies through these like canyons
4054760	4057600	and is evading these baby dragons.
4057600	4060480	Baby dragons, what the fuck?
4060480	4067720	Captain Dandy Pants gets on a heavy machine gun, it's mounted in the back of the helicopter.
4067720	4069680	You ever see baby dragons before?
4069680	4078240	I haven't seen any shit like this since fucking North Korea, what the fuck's going on?
4078240	4083560	If it fucking moves, then it's a commie, fuck this shit, god damn it, I will love America,
4083560	4090040	I'm fucking going insane, I can't believe there's baby dragons in real life, holy shit,
4090040	4094080	I should have loved my children.
4094080	4096520	What's Project Omega?
4096520	4103280	We'll talk about it in the debrief, stand down, take that morphine, or don't take it,
4103280	4104280	it's addictive.
4104280	4105280	I'll take it.
4105280	4109680	Okay, he shoots the baby dragons and the baby dragons kind of recede, that was kind of a
4109680	4116160	strange thing, like the baby dragon attack didn't seem very confident.
4116160	4121040	So the helicopter's taking you over the, it doesn't look like Vietnam, it looks like Palm
4121040	4126600	Beach and it just takes you along this shoreline and then it takes you to this what looks like
4126600	4133320	an American military base circa 1970 and you land.
4133320	4135680	Man this is nuts, right?
4135680	4138480	Do I ever see this before?
4138480	4139480	Do we?
4139720	4144880	You remember, you're still like floating halfway between like being Diggins and being Lars,
4144880	4152800	you're like, you can equally remember being born in this like little hamlet of, in this
4152800	4160320	like Middle Earth type realm where your parents were persecuted for being witches and so you
4160320	4168360	swore revenge and you ran away and you were raised by this weird coven of all women like
4168360	4176480	that were like super progressive and resented your maleness but also knew that in a misogynistic
4176480	4182160	world their greatest weapon would be like a male kind of priest that they could send
4182160	4183600	out on secret missions.
4183600	4192040	So they did love you but they also, they were like, in a weird ironic kind of Judi Dench
4192040	4198120	James Bond relationship they were like not intimate mothers to you so it's crazy because
4198120	4203840	you were raised by all like super powerful confident women but they were very like distant
4203840	4208640	like they didn't want to like attach to you as a person so you're really kind of fucked
4208640	4213120	up but you're also like super powerful like you're really good at focusing what would
4213120	4218760	have been your male rage and your misogyny into like these like powerful magic attacks
4218760	4226560	and like you hate yourself for having a penis but it's like really effective and you're
4226560	4236800	able to climb walls and if you meditate for an hour you can turn into a bat and it's also
4236800	4241640	clear to you it's like that's your whole life but then you also remember being diggens you're
4241640	4252000	like you were born in New Hampshire you came out when you were 13 it was 1963 that was
4252000	4258680	not well received and so you ran away from home you went to New York you you started
4258680	4263800	working in a diner you lied about your age so you didn't have to get a work permit and
4263800	4269840	you worked at a bakery and then you know the the draft came along and you you actually
4269840	4274280	volunteered because you're like fuck making cookies and you you you wanted to do something
4274280	4279200	meaningful with your life and part of it is like proving that you know you're trying to
4279720	4285360	you obviously can't you can't tell your fellow soldiers that you're gay but you like inside
4285360	4291440	you're like I'm gonna fucking be a hero I'm gonna save this country if not for my future gay
4291440	4297280	children then at least for myself like because I can't wait to like be at the you know like
4297280	4304480	be in this big dramatic like war and like come home alive and then take my purple heart and be
4304480	4310120	like by the way this is I'm a gay I'm a gay soldier like you you're kind of looking forward
4310120	4316440	to that but you ended up getting assigned to this like weird special ops team because you're
4316440	4321200	because you're really good because you have like this you're not afraid of death because you're
4321200	4325240	like why do I even want to go home where people hate me for something I can't control it's fucking
4325240	4330440	gross but you love America because you love freedom but it's like so hypocritical so you're
4330440	4335680	like I'm either gonna die a hero and you have a note sewn into your underwear that says by the
4335680	4342400	way I died fucking gay fuck you America but you hope no one ever finds it because but but you're
4342400	4347120	like fuck it like I kind of like it's a win-win that's your that's that's your catchphrases it's
4347120	4355160	a win-win it's like that's your that's your lock and load and so yeah and you're like you're like
4355160	4359800	this guy that you're the guy that like scrambles into the like booby-trapped holes with two guns
4359800	4367240	like like what's his name in platoon and you don't give a fuck man you're like they call you
4367240	4372400	the weasel and but it's like really affectionate because they're like they're like fuck man we got
4372400	4377320	the weasel like that's why we're gonna win they don't they don't they don't have this guy and so
4377320	4388080	you actually feel a fraternity with your brothers here Duke and Nuke Duke Nuke and Diggins like you
4388080	4395120	guys you guys you guys used to be part of what they called the Fantastic Four but like you're
4395120	4404360	you guys went on this one mission with Lieutenant Hammer and he got his arms blown off when he fell
4404360	4410880	for the oldest trick in the book baby carriage like he's just like sometimes this war is like
4410880	4414560	coming home and then he heard this baby crying went up to the carriage and fucking blew his arms
4414560	4418400	off and he was like you know doing the whole thing where he's like you hear this high-pitched
4418400	4422000	ringing in your ears while you're like watching him look he's like where are my arms and it's
4422000	4428280	like and then he fell down and and then you held him and you had to like overdose him on morphine

4686000	4691400	in ghillie suits you don't know but it's if they are they're like state of the fucking art they look
4691400	4695320	like they look like costumes from Wizard of Oz or something like they're like they look like
4695320	4700400	trees straight-up trees but they're like they got faces and they got like ammunition and their
4700400	4706840	their bandolier straps it's you think to yourself like why would you go to the trouble of disguising
4706840	4713640	a man as a tree and then and then put like fucking belts and shit on him but then you think hey
4713640	4720160	anything can be on a tree like what is a birdhouse like make people go hey why is there a house in
4720160	4728240	that tree it doesn't it's like what about a little kid like like one of them has a kid up up in his
4728240	4736960	branches who's who doesn't seem to even understand that he's climbing a marine and they they they
4736960	4741840	start moving like whereas before they moved like you didn't even notice them they were just just
4741840	4749520	like oh of course there's two trees on this beach adjacent 1970s marine base and a tropical
4749520	4761400	Vietnam coast base so they go over to these rocks and they and they and they touch the rocks and
4761400	4765720	these like panels open on them and they're doing something they nodded each other and they and
4765720	4771600	they they press something at the same time and this big giant door starts opening and there's
4771600	4779800	like a clack sound and it's like this big door opens up and there's a staircase going down and
4779800	4786680	dandy pants starts heading down and the helicopter starts taking off Murdoch goes like hey keep your
4786680	4796040	cocks and your socks and he takes off you too dandy pants looks back at you goes gentlemen we

4809360	4815480	well I definitely you go numb for that stuff but it's like it's definitely an unapologetically
4815480	4820400	homophobic culture like we like like people are just constantly calling each other fag and gay
4820400	4824640	and implying that they're weak and all this stuff and it's like it drives you fucking nuts but like
4825400	4831120	and I was raised by women so like yeah well your other your other half was in your in your
4831120	4838000	Diggins half you were you were just raised by you know mom pa kind of like like it was just a
4838000	4843080	regular kind of like Norman Rockwell kind of upbringing if it weren't for your gayness you
4843080	4850760	would have been a privileged life but you you you're honesty here your compulsion to be who you
4850760	4856040	really are and not put up with torture of like like having to conform like whereas no one else
4856040	4861560	does it made you it made you go like I'm not I'm not gonna do this and my mom and dad say they
4861560	4866040	love me no matter what like your mom told you once she said son do you know what love is when
4866040	4870280	you were like 11 and you're just having weird feelings like you didn't know what if they were
4870280	4876800	normal you didn't know who to talk to about it but your mom said to you once son I want you to know
4876800	4882720	what the definition of love is like unconditional love it means if you ever killed somebody I would
4882720	4888760	help you bury the body I wouldn't matter to me if if I if I thought you were right or wrong I don't
4888760	4895160	care if you turn out to be a serial killer I would still try to keep you alive as long as possible I
4895160	4900040	would I would I would take a bullet for you you're my son and I love you and then when you came out to
4900040	4905400	her she acted like you were a fucking monster and it broke your heart it was terrible like she
4905400	4912120	obviously was either lying about the like like the death thing or or or she really hates gay
4912120	4917560	people but in any case it was just like you just fucking of course you ran away you had to like
4917560	4921880	you didn't it wasn't even out of spite for them it was like out of pain like you had to like start
4921880	4930120	a new life on your own as a child you were just a kid and so now but what if you what if she just
4930120	4936040	like really wanted to be an accessory to murder yeah I know that's the one of the questions you
4936040	4940400	ask yourself is like it's like maybe my mom just wanted to like really hoped I would be a serial
4940400	4945560	killer like like like like maybe she was more just disappointed it really fucks with you so so like
4945560	4949800	but you're in the army but you're not you're not out you're not openly gay it's literally against
4949800	4954120	the rules like they would kick you out of the army if you said that you were gay or if you like yeah
4954440	4960360	um I think you you have you you you you've gotten way accustomed to like keeping things
4960360	4966840	way at a distance like you don't even like flirt around with like your closest friends like knowing
4966840	4971240	like there's something you know that you have that but you do think after all the shit you've
4971240	4977480	been through with these guys you you you one thing that you refuse to do is like when they talk about
4977480	4982520	pussy and stuff like okay wait to get back to stateside so I could take a labia and put it on

5004280	5011400	maybe they think like like oh and and it's like there's a part of you that thinks if if that's
5011400	5016120	the case if they know and they're and they're the fact that they're not bothering to ask you
5016120	5022040	about it corner you about it in this fucked up sick world that's like the that's the love that
5022040	5027800	your mom was trying to express to you in her hypothetical thing it's like is other men that
5027800	5034600	are that are that are agreeing to protect you unconditionally by going like I'm never gonna ask

6086520	6093320	not magic like you're you're you're sweeping around the room um uh are you trying to disguise that
6093320	6097320	or are you well i'm doing it in the darkness you're doing it sneakily yeah are you are you is it
6097320	6102280	your it's your objective to not yeah definitely be known so you're okay taking a penalty for that
6102280	6110120	reason okay so anyways you're fine uh but but yeah so you the colonel sanders is not he's not
6110120	6117560	magic and uh um the general general hodgehodge is not magic uh nothing in this room is magic except
6117560	6122440	for a flower pot by one of the chairs in the corner there's a strange plant growing out of it
6122440	6129560	and that screen behind the desk uh so that's like like like it's it's that's that's magical
6129560	6134280	and then the there's a there's a plant that's magical so that's i'm glad you did that boy i
6134280	6141400	was really hoping you did that when i designed this room oh damn i uh i elbow tom tom and i say
6141400	6147400	hey there's something up with that plant that screen yeah um i'll distract uh colonel sanders

6202680	6210600	anal uh reflexes to uh uh eject the the dagger from your ass onto the onyx floor of this strange
6210600	6217720	room uh it it definitely does a great job of distracting uh colonel sanders he's like well
6217720	6228520	i'll be an alabama side sloper side sloper he uh he he waves at the the general like like he's
6228600	6233400	snapstand i'm the general like it's like rustling of the thing and it's like he pulls out like a
6233400	6239480	strange kind of like uh bag that looks like it's made out of uh like uh shammy material like like
6239480	6245080	when you like shammy your car yeah and uh but it's like but it's like a forensic bag but it's
6245080	6253560	like leather uh and uh he he he he takes it over and he's got like a weird like forceps that he
6253640	6261000	had in his other pocket and he's like he holds up the the butt dagger and he was like you do you
6261000	6265720	remember that being inserted in your anal cavity soldier i have no memory of that sir i just know
6265720	6271960	that it's been there since time immemorial what do you recall about your childhood soldier
6274280	6280760	and i glaze over and realize i have no memories at all of my childhood okay so during this
6280760	6285240	distraction which is so you wanted this was a distraction yeah what did you want to do during
6285240	6289240	that distraction you're going to go like to the plant you're going to go over to it physically
6289240	6293480	sure i'll look at the plant okay you're you're you're you're walking casually over to the plant
6293480	6298680	and they are very distracted by this thing and um so you walk over to the plant the plant it looks
6298680	6304200	like uh like uh like kind of like a giant version of a bamboo shoot you know like when bamboo is
6304200	6310680	first growing uh it's just like this little like little pointy thing with like little things i don't
6310680	6315480	know what a bamboo shoot looks like uh but it's a giant version of that out of coming out of a
6315480	6323000	medium-sized pot and it's like a very rich green with like a beautiful kind of like a tropical
6323000	6330520	orange to yellow like accents on the edges of the leaves um and it's just it's just a vibrant uh
6330520	6339160	plant i reach out it's growing in sand like white sand say what and i i touch it you touch it yeah
6339160	6350280	okay okay when you when you touch it you feel like like uh incredibly uh rejuvenated like like
6350280	6354840	like not in terms of health like any wounds that you sustained or any fatigue in your muscles you
6354840	6361480	just feel like you feel like you could you could you you could like take on the world like you just
6361480	6368600	feel incredibly confident like it's like a crazy otherworldly uh uh uh morale that you've taken on
6368600	6378120	like you just feel fucking like messed out or how big is this plant it's like uh the the growth
6378120	6386680	is three feet tall coming out of a 11-inch pot made of uh standard terracotta can i like it's
6386680	6392360	about 13 inches in diameter can i like hide it behind my back you're hiding the plant behind
6392360	6396840	your back okay but you're just standing in front of the plant like you walked over there you looked
6396840	6402520	at it now you're gonna you touched it now you're uh so okay yeah so they're they're looking at the
6402520	6407160	dagger and so they're back to this that's happening during all of that that so now back
6407160	6413000	up to this point where you're saying yeah i have no memory of my childhood which childhood exactly
6413000	6417720	which child are you talking about my my orc childhood or the fake childhood that you planted
6417720	6429000	in my memory project omega your project omega wait i i reach over and i pull off the the goatee

6540280	6550920	what is that the valor aloe hell yeah that's cool as hell oh it gets a lot cooler than that
6550920	6557480	gentleman it also gets a lot worse and now that you've proven to be worthy test subjects
6558280	6564840	it's gonna get worse and worse and worse and better and better and better you're gonna do
6564840	6572120	so much for us we should probably tell him exactly what's been going on at this point
6572120	6582600	using our magic screen hit it the screen lights up with imagery that elucidate the topic as they
6582600	6599000	explained to you guys that um don't fail me now that the uh the the the the the the soviet union
6599000	6607480	when it uh when it dug into uh vietnam and korea it started realizing long before the americans
6607480	6612920	knew it that uh that a cold war was a losing one for the soviet union that capitalism was probably
6612920	6621080	going to work because i mean you know we all know that now look how happy we are um it uh but they
6621080	6626040	they knew that they were you know uh it wasn't going to work in a in a square on fight so they
6626040	6632120	started digging down into the earth in the uh places like cuba and uh north korea and uh and
6632120	6640920	the lake and uh they uh unearthed a subterranean cavern um when they dug down into uh uh north
6640920	6650680	korea uh and found a uh a dragon egg and uh they uh heated it up with an electric blanket and uh
6651400	6658120	and they uh they put it in an incubator and they studied it and it started to crack and hatch uh
6658120	6665080	and when it did uh something crazy started happening that uh seti the search for extraterrestrial
6665080	6669960	intelligence uh started reporting to them which was then a secret project no one knew that it was
6669960	6676520	actually started all the way back then uh and uh that they were starting to report like weird
6676520	6681720	like their equipment that they used to scan for intelligence in outer space was actually picking
6681720	6688040	up this weird signal that they first mistook for like is there alien presence like two feet
6688200	6693640	outside of earth's uh atmosphere that we can't see but then over time they started realizing
6693640	6699480	that there was this throbbing presence this signal that was previously unknown to mankind
6699480	6704440	that was emanating from the earth itself that something was happening so over time what they
6704440	6709720	realized is there was some kind of like awakening of magic energy that was happening at the point
6709720	6715720	where this uh this dragon egg started hatching so they they stopped incubating the egg uh and took
6715720	6722760	it to a secure facility uh more on that in the third adventure uh that we'll do uh new year's um
6724920	6732520	but uh then they they found out that uh that so there's that you know um uh that magic is real
6732520	6739480	and uh and they found like uh and then and then and then and then and the russians were oh there
6739480	6748920	it is okay yeah they found out magic is real and uh and uh and then uh so they started they
6748920	6753640	had already been doing like these programs like uh in the american military that where they're doing
6753640	6759240	like remote viewing and and mk ultra and stuff like that experimenting with lsd and brainwashing
6759240	6764920	and all this stuff um so spies american spies with that that had access to the information of what
6764920	6772680	the soviets had uncovered they uh they used it to liberate some of this uh uh information and
6772680	6780920	used it to dig down in uh los alamos uh uh because and and find a dragon egg of their own
6781880	6789000	and uh it they did not incubate it um but they uh they started chiseling into it and when they did
6789080	6795080	that um the person that was chiseling it got struck with a bolt in his eyeballs and he flew
6795080	6800760	back and his hair turned white and he became this colonel sanders guy um so so that that's
6800760	6806040	this guy he was like uh he's like a head scientist from mit that they entrusted with this project
6806040	6811560	and his name is colonel well we gave him a name before i can't remember um let's call him colonel
6811560	6818040	sanders and uh he so he like and he he gained all this knowledge when he tried to like chisel into
6818040	6824040	this dragon egg and from his knowledge he started like dictating to uh like uh think tanks and stuff
6824040	6830920	and they started writing up all of these like uh tomes and things like uh and storing them uh uh
6830920	6839080	in transistorized devices and analyzing them and america so since like the 1959 has had this secret
6839080	6844440	operation going where they've been like uh trying to like it's a magical arms race that's been going
6844440	6852280	on between the soviets and and america uh uh all this time um uh it's it's it was largely like not
6852280	6858520	generating any results but they um had been like training people to try to use this stuff like like
6858520	6864520	there you know like oh like what if you uh read this stuff can you try can you cast spells can
6864520	6868840	you do stuff and it wasn't really working that well but it was getting enough results that it's
6868840	6873720	got massive funding and god forbid the russians actually accomplish something before we do so
6873720	6877560	that's just been going on underground which is why the defense budgets are so enormous it's like
6878280	6881880	how could a nuclear missile cost that much it's crazy you just take some nuclear shit and put it
6881880	6887880	in a fucking bullet and throw it like like it's it's it's a huge invention the idea that it takes
6887880	6892040	a lot of money to make a nuclear missile all that money goes into also schools it doesn't
6892040	6897320	cost that much to teach children so all of that money uh has been secretly funneled into uh into
6897320	6904280	these programs and uh uh so when you guys joined the military uh you you you went through basic
6904280	6909960	training but then like through certain tests and things they detected kind of aptitude uh on your
6909960	6915960	parts and then they started like funneling you over into these programs um uh where you were
6915960	6922600	getting uh uh trained for this other stuff and the the reason that we actually went to vietnam
6922600	6928040	isn't because we were trying to protect the you know the world from communism in the sense of like
6928040	6935880	vietnam being strategic it's because they there's a site in in in vietnam where uh the soviets had
6935880	6942920	found uh this like uh weird like stonehenge like structure but underground in this like uh cavern
6943000	6952200	and uh it was like this like it it it it made more magic uh and so they sent you guys on a
6952200	6958840	reconnaissance mission uh uh and uh and then you got captured but then they put they tried some
6958840	6964040	weird shit on you and you had this whole adventure that we don't remember uh but you were and you
6964040	6969320	were in this different world and uh and then you you woke up in that in that cell and then then
6969320	6974520	now you're now you're remembering that this was all part of some crazy mission that started in
6974520	6980040	you know in vietnam and you you still don't understand did you go through a portal i bet you
6980040	6987800	did uh like why like like like why were you uh on the other you know in this other world so
6987800	6992600	like that's these guys are like they've always suspected that the reason why these dragon eggs
6992600	6998360	are creating this like uh magic energy is because they're the only things from a different uh
6998360	7005560	universe that uh uh and and uh that that exist in ours and that there must be some way to get to
7005560	7011400	that universe where magic is normal and technology isn't and if you could get there then you could
7011400	7017800	take magic energy and use it for military purposes over here and so it seems like maybe the russians
7017800	7024520	have found uh a way to get to the other side and you guys must have been there and escaped i have
7024520	7030840	one question for the for the game i have one question for the game master whose turn is it um
