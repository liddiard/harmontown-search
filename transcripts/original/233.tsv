0	13640	Who's got a pen? I need to steal a pen from somebody. Can you tell me a pen, brother?
13640	19160	From Burbank, California, at Starburn's Castle, it's the very first time that Harmon Town
19160	26000	is in session from the beautiful confines of the weird warehousey thing that is Starburn's
26000	37120	Castle. Let's bring up Spencer Crittenden, shall we? What up? Oh, yeah. It feels good,
37120	44440	doesn't it? It feels in session. It feels extra sexy. Yeah. Speaking of extra sexy,
44440	52080	let's bring up the mayor. The mayor of Harmon Town is Dan Harmon. Thank you.
57080	64880	All right. Thanks for joining us at a temporary location or whatever, an experimental location.
64880	71640	Is it not permanent? What's the status? I don't know. I don't make big moves. I work organically.
72640	79200	Why do they call you Big Moves Harmon? It's an ironic nickname. In prison, they called me tiny
79200	89000	because the average height is 5'5". So how was prison? Prison was great. What were you in for
89000	94800	again? Yeah. I started watching the show, what the hell is it called? World's Most Dangerous
94800	100720	Prisons or Inside Them or something like that. It's called Inside Them colon World's Most Dangerous
100720	111600	Prisons. It's some guy who is like a kind of a, he's from wherever the, what the shrimpy guy,
111600	116400	what's his name, he's in the phone booth thing where they get a talk on the phone or he gets
116400	124840	shot. Colin Farrell. Colin Farrell. It's this guy that looks like him. He's a little short. I don't
124960	133920	think he's a large man. I don't think Colin Farrell, they call him a, a, a moose. Yeah. There's a guy
133920	138200	and he then he goes and he gets himself locked up in the world's most dangerous prisons throughout
138200	143440	the world. There's a prison in Honduras. I guess that's the murder capital of the world. That's
143440	150560	probably an easy title to claim like best pizza or whatever. But, but, but there's the prison there.
150600	154720	It's like built for like, I don't know, let's say 70 people. I'm pulling numbers out of my ass.
154720	160240	There's like 700 people in it. It's like very overcrowded as most prisons are. We are generating
160240	165960	more bad people than good people these days. It's a buyer's market. The, it, it, it, there's,
165960	171840	they, at a certain point it's like, it's escaped from New York. They like pull, the guards pulled
171840	181160	out and they just like rolled wooden batons like by the box in there and said like, whoever the
181160	187640	people you trust the most are, they're the new guards. And so some of the murderers have sticks
187640	196200	and that's their system and it works really well. Like the guards can't go in there. Right. They,
196200	200040	they, they go in there at night to lock up. I guess they have like, it's a, it's sort of like,
200160	207800	wouldn't, wouldn't the bad guys get the sticks first? Bad guys have the sticks as one would
207800	214880	argue in all of, all of society. It just kind of tends to be that way. Good guys don't want sticks.
214880	222560	And, and, and so in this prison, like some of the rapists and murderers have been deputized to beat
222560	226640	the other ones that get out of line. They're deputizing each other. Like they're saying,
226640	232200	hey, crazy guy. Like, like you, you like sticks. Like, how do they pick it? I don't know how they
232200	238920	picked it. There's a guy at the top that insists he profits nothing from it. Who says, well telling
238920	244840	you, if you want to bet, it costs $135 and all this stuff. And then it's the whole place has a
244840	249760	kind of, I mean, there was no, everyone's like lifting weights and everything's very scary. And
249760	255920	everyone's kind of leering at you. But what you didn't see was like mass chaos. And it was just
255920	262680	this Colin Farrell looking guy going like, Oh, I'm filling buckets of water. Oh, and then he would
262680	268200	go and talk to all the, the, the mucky mucks within this system, none of whom are guards. And then he
268200	273280	like shoot pool with the guards on the outside of the system that the guards are guarding, but can't
273280	278400	get in the guards job to make sure that all 700 of these people don't at some point go, Hey, there's
278400	284960	700 of us. Let's all escape at the same time. That is their single task is to keep that day from
284960	290520	happening. How they do that, I guess it has something to do with the fact that what separates
290520	296720	the prison from the rest of Honduras, which is like a chain link fence that you had at your grade
296720	302800	school playground is which drugs are just flying back and forth over the top of it. I think the
302800	307600	people in there are kind of happy. The prisoners are, I mean, they're like, they'd like to be out
307600	311480	if they could leave any time they wanted, but they can't leave any time they wanted. So they've
311480	317120	created a society for themselves that includes weekend long conjugal visits. The wives and
317120	322880	children come to visit them. They showed that weekend happening. And there's no, if you fuck
322880	328720	with the wives or children during that weekend, like you, it's like, it, it, you know, obviously
328720	332320	there's repercussions. There's repercussions. If you piss off the fucking murderers that have
332320	339000	sticks, I'm doing, um, the law is laid down within that prison. And then the guards like shooting
339000	344600	billiards with the host of the show who's saying like, how's it, so would it work? Do you guys
344600	349680	want to be to have control back? Because one time they tried to take control back and everyone just
349680	356640	went and waved their shirts around like strippers and threw garbage cans at them and they had to
356640	362560	leave. They're like, okay, all right, we'll, we'll come look for drugs later. And they were like,
362560	370080	yay, we're in prison. We're free. How do you think you would handle prison if you had to do like,
370080	375920	like real time, like federal time start by killing myself the day I was sentenced to prison? Because
375920	383560	guys like me do not know what movies you've seen now. Okay. Let's get specific. Day one, you're in
383560	387920	prison. You go, okay, I want to kill myself. I'm going to be here for six years. I want to kill
387920	392480	myself. How do you do it? No, no, no, no. I do it in court. When the judge says you're going to
393280	399200	and I go bang, bang, bang on the, on the, I take his gavel and I stick it through my eyeball.
400400	405040	Because I could, because the way if he did the prayer, I knew the rest of the word would be isn't.
405040	409760	Right. So I'm just like, gouge, gouge. You think you could make it from the desk you said that to
409760	416720	the gavel without a bailiff shutting you. I mean, look, if Batman was in the gallery, you know,
416720	421920	like in the one movie where Batman couldn't even make it to protect Harvey Dent from getting his
421920	429680	face toed. Remember that movie or Batman's in court on his Batman outfit. They, they explained
429680	435760	Harvey Dent's turning into Two-Face. It was one of those older Batman movies. There was a mafia
435760	441040	guy and he had a revealed, he had a jar of poison on the witness stand and he went, and then it cut
441040	448400	to Batman in the court going, no. And then it cut to Harvey Dent going, yikes. And holding a Manila
448400	457680	folder across half of his face. Hence his transformation into Two-Face. A folder? Yeah,
457680	465120	I guess it's an older movie than you kids have seen. That was the Dark Knight Rises, right? Or
465120	469280	returns or something. This is the second of these Nolan Batman movies. No, no, I don't think it was
469280	475600	a Nolan movie. That was a, I think that was a... Doesn't he hold up a folder in that new one too?
475600	481280	I think it's a folder. I think everyone holds up a folder when Bane takes over because he goes like,
481280	488160	I give you back, you all sit here. Hold your folders high. And everyone holds up a folder.
489120	492480	I think that's what you're thinking of. So Dan, you got, you're, you're a new gun owner.
493200	496960	Say what? You got a weapon now. You got a gun. No, I haven't picked it up yet because things...
496960	502400	Right, okay. Because it turns out it seems like, it seems like it's as hard to usurp democracy as
502400	506320	it is to maintain it. I feel like we're just... Well, yeah. I feel like this whole country is
506320	512240	just going to collapse. Were you getting a gun to overthrow democracy? I was getting a gun. Be honest.
512240	519440	Be honest. This is a safe space. I was getting a gun to, to protect my soup and women. Right.
520480	528400	In the event of total economic destabilization, which might result in my neighborhood looking
528400	534480	up at my home, which looks like Victor Frankenstein's home. Right. Like, like, like in a
534480	538720	village of people who only know that I've been robbing their graves to assemble some sort of
538720	546240	monster. I, I, you know, I just, I just wanted to have a power tool in my home that... That drills
546240	552480	holes in faces. In people that want water, you know, more than they want politeness.
553040	559040	Do you, do you have fantasies about like, actually like what you must, because like you've, you've,
559040	563360	you've bought a gun that, that what would happen? Like if somebody came up your steps and demanded
563360	567760	your water or your women? No, I don't. I would argue that that is fallacious logic. I bought the gun
567760	574640	because I don't have fantasies about what I do. If, if, if shit went that far, I, that's why I got
574640	579600	the, I wanted to buy the gun is from the impulse of being feeling like I am not a person that could
579600	587840	be relied upon in a situation of such heightened crisis that, you know, so, so no, I don't sit and
587840	592320	think, man, I hope a guy comes up my sidewalk. I'm not saying you hope that happens, but like, no,
592320	598000	but I have, and I also have an entertainer. All I, I just have vague, a vague like cloud of like
598960	605360	chaos in my head where I'm like, well, look what has happened in the, in the, in the, in the,
605360	610960	the first 10 days of this presidency made me look at the 10 day waiting period that you need
610960	618240	to get a gun as a crucial 10 days. And I now have what I, what makes me feel very comfortable,
618240	625440	which is a one day, a drive to Burbank waiting period. I have a gun waiting for me in a store
625440	631440	run by guys who know how to use guns. I haven't, I wanted to, you know, so I, I'm saying like,
631440	636560	I'm feeling better now. Maybe that's what the waiting period is for. It's, it's sitting over
636560	640640	there. I can go pick it up anytime. It's probably better there than in my cabinet.
640640	646640	Well, when you were shopping around for like on our little Slack, uh, what, what is Slack?
646640	655360	Slack. It's a coordinating app for communicating with teens. No, teams, teams, teams. I was thinking
655360	663360	of Snapchat. You're thinking of 4chan. Yeah. Uh, there's the, the Burbank firing line,
663360	667440	which I've been to a couple of times. I'm not a gun guy, but I've shot there a couple of times
667440	670720	with friends that have guns and it's, you know, it's, it's fun to go shoot a gun, but I wouldn't
670720	678000	ever want one. Uh, but I, I just found out that gun, uh, indoor firing ranges, there's loads of
678000	682960	fucking suicides. People go in there and they've had three suicides. Oh, people actually go there
682960	687040	to to kill themselves. They go in there to rent a bullet. They go, oh yeah, here's my credit card.
687040	691920	I'll be right back. And they go bang. And they fucking shoot their fucking brains all over the,
691920	696880	the person next to them. And there's been three suicides of the firing line recently. And
696880	700800	apparently that's not just there. It's everywhere. Like, like, now, what do we think of that person?
700800	706240	Is that person a bad person? Is that person? Yeah, they suck. I think that person is a good
706240	710240	planner. I'm glad they don't shoot other people. It'd be so easy. And then, then, you know, it's
710240	714480	just the people who would be at a gun range. So it's not like, right? Well, that's the first thing
714480	719120	is they're, they're revealing that in the throes of depression enough that life means absolutely
719120	724160	nothing to them, that they don't do something that you could do if you thought life meant nothing,
724160	729360	which is cheat at the grand theft auto game of life and just go bling, blang, bloom, bloom,
729360	734240	like, like just to see what would happen before you boo boomed. So in a way, gun ranges provide
734240	741040	a valuable, like, suicide booth service. I just think that's really interesting. I just don't
741040	745920	think I could ever go back to a firing range and be relaxed. I'm not relaxed because you're holding
745920	751680	a gun. It's, it's, it's, it's stressful. The firing, the firing line in Burbank on Victory, I think,
752240	755680	I went there once, I'd never fired a gun. They said, sir, have you ever fired a weapon before? I said,
755680	760640	no, I haven't. And they go, all right, so fill this out. Like, like, like, you have to, you know,
760640	765520	sign some waivers and shit. And they said, the first thing that you're going to shoot here is
765520	775520	the 357 Magnum, which is a cannon. And this is to teach you some respect. And it was fucking bonkers.
775520	781040	That thing is so loud and so scary that I couldn't ever relax. But now if I think that the guy next
781040	787120	to me might just go like, I want to fucking kill myself. Like, it's, yeah. Well, I think, I think,
787120	790320	look, you're gonna laugh when I say this, but there's, there's something very uplifting about
790320	797440	that. That because we're constantly talking to, we're arguing with between people, like,
798080	802240	well, in a pre-Trump era, there was a big religious connotation that had to do with
802240	805760	the division between the left and the right, particularly in the idea of like,
805760	810560	oh, what are we going to do if there's no God, there's no morality and all this stuff. And like,
810560	817520	the, the, you know, practical minded atheists among us, the people, it's like, hey, I don't need
817520	823920	a boogeyman or a fairy tale or a superstition and not to, not to devalue anything that anyone
823920	829360	has a personal relationship with. But I'm just saying like, like people don't need that in order
829360	836160	to do the cool thing, the nice thing. An argument could be made that people are particularly geared
836160	842880	to as a perfect example of a situation, you're holding a gun. There's literally a lane of people
842880	849920	on either side of you. You've, you've come here because you have decided that life itself means
849920	855440	so little. You obviously aren't fearing that you're going to wake up in a pool of lava with like
855440	860320	pitchforks going up your butt because those people definitely make sure you know that suicide is one
860320	865840	of the things that'll make that happen. So you have made your peace with chaos. You have made your
865840	871280	peace with oblivion. You have an emotional thing going on in your head where the pain of living is
871280	878960	so high that, that you just want it to end. And you don't, as you step out the door, do this horrible
878960	885600	trollish thing, you know, that is not what most of us want to do. We are not held in line by getting
885600	892240	away with it. There's no cops in this room. There's no cops like, there's no cops on this room.
895280	898880	There's one outside. He wouldn't let me walk in that door. There are, there are paid employees of
898880	904960	harm in town that could fucking kill you if I snap my fingers. Do not heckle me. But there are
904960	912640	no cops in this room, man. But, but it's like, we're not held in line by, you know, we're, we're not
912640	918240	animals. And these Honduran prisoners are, you know, I think the guy is like cutting vegetables
918240	923120	with a guy that killed someone with a machete. And he's, and he's saying, it's weird. I'm cutting
923120	931360	cucumbers and you, you cut someone over the machete. And he's like, yeah, so true. Chop, chop, chop, chop.
931360	937600	It, it, it, I don't know how that supported my point, but it was just something that popped
937600	941920	in my head. It's a reason why I want to keep watching this series. Are you getting a gun,
941920	948720	Spencer? I don't know. Should I get a gun, you guys? Well, I think I heard one yes and one no.
948800	954080	So, so there it is. No, you couldn't, you, you, you, you posted a very
954800	960320	inner, but you, you're very, you're very passionately anti-gun. I know a lot. I know a lot of things.
961280	966720	And here's what I know. Guns kill people. I don't want to kill people. I got to say, Dan,
966720	971840	I, I know you don't like being like a game saver. I don't like the gun thing. No, no,
972720	976960	it makes me uncomfortable. My decision to get a gun is not a thing that I don't expect to be
976960	980720	gainsaid on. Okay. So let's, you're right. I don't like to be gainsaid. What the fuck
980720	986480	is gainsaid? It's for the apocalypse. I brought it up as a confessional thing
986480	994320	because I consider that purchase a, I, I, I'm, I'm confessing about it. I'm not,
994320	999520	I'm not telling people that, uh, that I did the smartest thing in the world that I recommend
999520	1006400	everyone do. I, I, I'm sharing with, with people that these are crazy times and that we're all
1006400	1012160	dealing with it in weird ways and the liberals are becoming, uh, anti-Nazis and anti-Nazis are
1012160	1018880	becoming Nazis and like, you know, the, the people who used to say, maybe freedom of speech is
1018880	1024400	overrated are now saying, I love the second amendment. Uh, it's like, like, like, it's
1024400	1029040	confusing times and we're scared and how are we dealing with it and what do we do? And I, I, I
1029040	1034560	wanted to, you know, I'm not a person with solutions and I'm not a pundit and I'm not a,
1034560	1039520	I'm not an academic. I dropped out of college. I, I, so I, I'm going to share what I'm going
1039520	1044160	through. Like, I'm not going to leave a fucking molecule out of it. I bought a gun. I bought a
1044160	1054960	gun because that's how, like, that's how, that's how close to the doomsday line the, it feels,
1054960	1061840	the clock thing with the doomsday clock. What do they call it? The doomsday clock. Um, I, I bought
1061840	1067680	a gun because of the unknown. I didn't buy a gun because I thought anything specific was going to
1067680	1076480	happen. I bought a gun because for my entire life of should I buy a gun that Pachinko ball of logic
1076480	1083040	always ended with, of course not. And now we are in times where it landed somewhere else. And I
1083040	1088320	think that's notable. I don't think it's admirable. I don't think it's inspirational. I immediately
1088320	1092720	already, having since talked about it, I got a tweet from a guy that was like, which would you
1092720	1097520	recommend the, where did you get the Glock thing? And I was like, whoa, shut it down. Shut it down.
1097520	1103440	I'm not going to have conversations where I proactively influence your decision about these,
1103440	1108400	these things like, and God knows we're minutes from another Sandy hook, at which point it's going to
1108400	1112560	take on another religious connotation of like, like, like, like, holy shit, I'll be ashamed of
1112560	1118640	myself forever using the word gun again for a little while. Like, like, so like, don't just
1118640	1124080	value my candor, my confession, my honesty. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I bought this thing
1124080	1131520	because the morning that after the election, I went downstairs and like after an evening of my
1131520	1139360	girlfriend staring off into space, like the moment she saw my dog sitter, they exchanged niceties.
1140320	1145280	And then one of them said, how are you doing? And they both burst into tears. And then everywhere I
1145280	1150560	went, everyone had been crying all morning, and then they had to dry their tears and they were
1150560	1157760	hollow people there that had to get back to work. And I felt emasculated. I felt helpless. I felt
1157760	1162960	like there was something I had to be able to do. I'm not Sir Han, Sir Han. I don't think the thing
1163120	1170400	I need to do involves the gun. I feel like I have no recourse to power. And that is an arrogant,
1170400	1176640	narcissistic, white privilege, straight white male like reaction that is notable. It's important to
1176640	1182560	measure it. I bought a fucking gun. Like, does that mean I, it's like I didn't delete my Uber app
1182560	1189760	until it was important to defeat Uber because I was fighting another white guy. I heard 900 stories
1189760	1195120	from women about how fucking horrible Uber was. And then the day that it was a way to give another
1195120	1200160	white guy a black eye, I was like, delete. Like, I love Lyft now. Tell me about your podcast,
1200160	1208320	you fucking weirdo. Our next guest is, we should bring out our guest. What am I doing? I told him,
1208320	1212240	here's how the show works. I go up and I talk for 10 minutes and then I'll bring you up.
1214080	1218480	Okay. You're ready to go. I just met this guy on another show that I did. Let's just get to
1218480	1222800	know him at the same time because I said, you should come on my show. And he's a rapper and
1225360	1229840	a creator of beats. I don't know if the title would be DJ, but his name is Open Mike Eagle.
1242960	1246800	You go ahead. You can move everything you want. I can keep talking to him.
1246800	1251040	He brought his own stool on stage. Yeah. That's a power move, I think.
1251760	1253680	You're allowed to bring your own furniture on stage.
1257360	1262320	That's the Chicago way. Not only is it just like I'm adding furniture to the mix,
1262320	1266240	but also like you have to do it with such ease that it's like, I'm a powerful man.
1266240	1270800	Yeah. I don't need a gun. I need it. Yeah. I mean, it's a small stool though.
1270960	1276160	No, I'm not saying it's I could, I could move that one around too. It's the appearance of power.
1276160	1280240	That's the way it's a power move. It doesn't have to be a heavy stool. He brought it up on
1280240	1284480	stage like he made it. Like he had, he carved that out of a single piece of wood.
1286480	1290960	Let's do a test. Well, Mike Eagle, Chris, are we ready to do a test where we, uh,
1290960	1296720	what if I said I wanted to cut to a photo for the, oh shit, he's running. Okay. I didn't mean to do
1296720	1301600	that. No, this is the test. This is the test. No, I didn't realize. I didn't know. In the future,
1301600	1307760	you might be able to, we could just walk probably walking or I could. Yeah. Chris, what have I said?
1307760	1317600	I want. Yeah, we did it. White people, white people and one honorary woman. So I want to,
1317600	1322880	how do they let a woman sneak into that fucking photo of creepy gross? This is,
1322880	1330240	this is a poster of a, now you see me too. I think I want to talk about a theory I have about
1330240	1336640	this photo or rather an obsession I have about this photo. Now, uh, assumption number one that
1336640	1341280	I'm allowed to make because of the geometry of this photo, this is a tripod, tripod mounted
1341280	1349200	photograph. There's, this is not a quick, uh, Hey secretary of labor, labor us a photo, um,
1349200	1354080	with your Samsung and a bit. Well, well, people hack it and so they can see nuclear launch codes
1354080	1360480	in your fucking patio. Um, the, the, the, the, the, the lines are lined up here. This is a tripod
1360480	1366640	mounted shot. Uh, I it's been swiveled because any human in their right mind would center the desk
1366640	1373920	in the frame. Uh, there are an almost, there are an almost equal number of people on both sides,
1373920	1382000	unless you count homophobic pants over here who, who I think was either, I'm trying to figure out
1382000	1387840	if he's doing a power play and showed up late. No, he, he set the timer. He was the guy that went
1387840	1395200	over to the camera. Wait, Jeff. No, I'm sorry, but he ran. The camera has been swiveled. Do you
1395200	1400720	understand the, the, the, on the, uh, on the, uh, on what the audience is, uh, right side of the frame,
1400720	1405680	what you see is a, you could measure that line. You would take half of that line and you would
1405680	1410480	put it over here. If you wanted to know where the frame would be, if this desk were centered,
1410480	1417200	it would cut right across Pence's shoulder. And if Pence wasn't in the shot, by the way, over here,
1417200	1426800	uh, Herman Munster, secretary of fucking crazy pumpkin head thumbs, uh, a living golem from the,
1426800	1433600	not from Lord of the Rings, from the Hebrew tradition, a, a, an animated man, uh, brought
1433600	1439280	here for the purpose of vengeance. Um, and behind him, who has two subs? It looks like Chris Farley's
1439280	1450400	ghost. Uh, that guy's, that guy's head would be a little over to the right, which he wouldn't be
1450400	1456560	bent like that. He is scrunching in because the camera moved this way. The camera moved this way.
1456560	1462560	I believe that these two aren't getting along for good reason. I don't think Pence was told
1462560	1468320	this photo was happening. He ran in last second. I think he was taking a shit. He walked by the
1468320	1472080	oval office. If that's where this is, it looks obvious to me. I want to know more about the
1472080	1477600	guy with the orange tie. Noah was an orange fucking tie. It's very clear that you wear
1477600	1484080	red or blue ties. This guy's got a Halloween tie back there. Also, she only gets one thumb. All the
1484080	1490400	guys got two thumbs. It's a shame that women only have one for every two thumbs a man. Women
1490400	1498240	actually only get 70% of thumbs. Yeah. Women only get eight oceans to every 11 oceans a man makes.
1498240	1503120	Is that right? Yeah. Remember when the national conversation would have been about zero black
1503120	1507200	people in the photo. Like it would have been just a talking point. We, it's not that we don't notice
1507200	1512080	it. It's that we know they're white nationalists and that is like, and we've, we have bigger fish
1512080	1517280	to fry now. We're like, yeah, well they're racist. They haven't made any bones about that. So we're
1517280	1521760	moving on. Like, like, because we're like, how do we get them out of there? We're not like, we're no
1521760	1526240	longer policing them and going like, it would be nice to see some diversity in that photo. We're
1526240	1533680	like, Hey, is there, is there anything in this photo that could show us their weakness? Also,
1533680	1538080	has there ever been, is there a kryptonite barrel in the corner that has ever been a desk that big
1538080	1543360	that didn't have a fucking book or a pen on it? Like he doesn't, it's a desk. He doesn't have any
1543360	1548000	shit on it. That's not, he clearly doesn't want desks. He doesn't want to be at that desk. That's
1548000	1552560	not a good desk. That's not the desk of someone who uses a desk. It's a good desk for finding the
1552560	1557760	book of secrets. If you, uh, as I said, but remember, remember Obama's first couple days in
1557760	1564880	office. Hey, Mike, keep it down. Would you? Oh, thanks. I remember when, uh, one of the first
1564880	1568800	things, cause they have to, it was like Obama with the Hitler mustaches. Oh, it's the end of
1568800	1573200	the world. Obama's president. Oh God, how can we, how will we live through two years of this,
1573200	1577360	four years of this, eight years of this? It's a black man in the white house. We're all going to
1577360	1582640	die. And the first thing was look at him. He's not even wearing his jacket at the desk because
1582640	1587040	the first photo was him with his shirt sleeves rolled up and he was on the phone, fucking papers
1587040	1592080	everywhere, getting to work. And then somebody split screened it with Kennedy and it was, he was
1592080	1598480	the same. I was like, yeah, I'm a civil servant. I fucked Marilyn Monroe, but I also, I want work
1598480	1602720	to get done. All right. Anyways, whatever. When did I become political? The issue is when we started
1602720	1608000	dying. There was a great Twitter moment where somebody posted this picture and said, uh,
1608000	1614240	what's this mixtape called? And then everybody was, was sending in answers. It was great. Mine was,
1615120	1621040	male white marauders. This is the name of this fiction. Um, it's a hip hop joke. I'm sorry.
1623760	1629280	Yeah. Well, let's talk about the fact that, uh, about hip hop jokes and that we won't get like,
1630240	1635680	I'm so full of those. Yeah. We, we just met like, like, I didn't have time. I'm not going to pretend
1635680	1639200	I'm like, oh, I'm a huge fan of open mic Eagle, but I liked what you were doing in the show that
1639200	1643280	I met you in. And then I was like, after the show, like you should come and do it to my show,
1643280	1648080	but I know nothing about you. I know you're from Chicago. I know that you're, uh, like, like, like,
1648080	1652800	what were you, what was your upbringing like? Oh shit. Uh, it was fucked up. I live like,
1653520	1657920	like right by the projects, like not in them, but kind of like right by them and shit. Uh,
1657920	1663120	and I went to elementary school that was like nestled within the projects. Uh, so I had,
1663120	1669760	I lived with my grandparents and my mom was fucked up. Um, and yeah, I had to try to have
1669760	1674720	like a normal childhood accepted. Like they kept me very sheltered and it was like gunshots and
1674720	1679280	crack cocaine and all that. And you had, uh, had uncles and aunts, they're all strung out on shit.
1679280	1684640	Um, but they kept me in the house. So like, I just watched a shit ton of like fucking cable
1684640	1689360	television in the late eighties and early nineties a lot. Raised by your grandparents? Yeah. And so
1689360	1696080	what was their take on the world around? Stay inside. That was it. Stay don't, don't go outside.
1697040	1702480	Did they have, uh, as a white, naive question, did they have a take that was
1703520	1707840	racially based? Like, did they have, did they have talks with you about what to do when the
1707840	1712400	cops and blah, blah, blah, and what, what other black people do? And my grandparents were black
1712400	1720640	people from the South. Let me finish. Okay. Um, and what that meant is all of their talks
1721600	1729840	were, uh, alarmingly racist, like, but not in like, uh, like not in a cute way. Like I had a
1729840	1735040	Japanese seventh grade teacher and the shit that my sweet old grandmother used to say about that
1735040	1739920	man, it was fucking awful. You know, like she was a great person, but, you know, I think we'd all
1739920	1748480	like to hear. I wouldn't, I wouldn't, so we can cluck our tongues and also go, yeah, just an
1748560	1752320	example would be great. So we know how to judge her. Yeah. She called, she called him a bunch of
1752320	1757520	shit that, uh, obviously was learned in world war two. Oh, so she would say like actual slurs,
1757520	1762480	you wouldn't just use stereotypes. Like, how did she drive to teach you? It was, it was slow.
1762480	1767600	Cause she, cause she, you know, she, I don't know. It was just, uh, part of the lexicon for her to
1767600	1773360	say those awful, awful things. And now, but how, and how did she feel about, cause she's from a
1773360	1780000	certain generation, like what was her and your grandpa's, uh, like there it's like, if they're
1780000	1785280	looking at a Korean person, they might have all kinds of like comforting things to say about the
1785280	1793440	other, but what was their feeling about how they fit into their government, their society,
1793440	1798880	their neighborhood, whatever, you know, it was more like keep your nose to the ground and work.
1798960	1803360	They, they didn't have a lot of, we didn't have a lot of talk about identity. Like my dad talked
1803360	1807280	to me about a lot of that stuff. My grandparents, they were, they were working people and they
1807280	1811360	worked and they wanted to make sure we were safe and did our homework and shit. They could care
1811360	1816720	less about a lot of, you know, a lot of social and racial identity and that kind of thing.
1816720	1820320	So they were just sort of like, were they Christian? Yeah. And so they were kind of like,
1820320	1825520	just be a good person and, and go to church and like be like work hard and stay out of trouble.
1825520	1829360	Yeah. Do your homework. Don't hit girls at school. Like, you know what I mean? Like just,
1829360	1834880	just real straight down the middle shit, you know? And they, did you mainly adhere to that or were
1834880	1840400	you a rebel in your youth? No, I wore, uh, I wore corduroys and the sweaters that they brought me
1840400	1847520	from Kmart. So my rebelling would be, uh, not wearing my shirt all the way up to the top. That
1847520	1853440	was my, that was my rebellion. And what were you interested in when you were like, uh, sixth grade,
1853440	1856800	seventh grade, eighth grade, like going through puberty, like, what did you imagine? Were you
1856800	1860800	scarred by the Japanese teacher you had? Did that, did that fuck you up? No, I loved him. He was
1860800	1866240	fantastic. He was all, he was an amazing part. Mr. Matsumoto was fucking awesome. Matsumoto,
1866240	1871280	it's like, like, like easy to remember too. Yeah, he's great. He made an impression on me.
1871280	1875680	You could just start making up that name and find your way through it and still be right.
1875680	1881520	Okay. All right. Look, I mean, maybe I'm in your grandma's side. Maybe,
1883680	1888960	maybe I like to dehumanize. Maybe that and Christ are blankets I wrap around me at night and maybe
1888960	1894000	the world has no other options for me. Uh, no, but, uh, what, what, when you were like, like,
1894000	1898480	pick your age, 10, 11, 12, whatever, but like at a certain, there's, there's a point where,
1899280	1906080	where your future is like all, you know, like, like, like, what was the astronaut dream or the,
1906080	1911040	like, I remember me and my best friend said we were gonna, we were gonna get a boat and we were
1911040	1915280	gonna sail into the Bermuda triangle and we were gonna like, just like find out what the deal was
1915280	1919040	with the Bermuda triangle. And we were pinky swearing. We're like, seriously though, you know
1919040	1923600	how old people get fat and old and then they don't want to do that. And then we're like, no, for real,
1923600	1928320	I fucking know we're going to look you up. And we're like, like we set a date and I've, you know,
1928320	1936960	of course I fucked him over. I mean, my personal dream like that was that I, I, I had romanticized
1936960	1943760	being like in like the secret service or some shit, but really because in my dumb mind, uh,
1943760	1949600	the secret service guys were like somebody in the government knows everything and it's got to be
1949600	1954160	those guys. They're the secret service. Yeah. So they got to know all the secrets. They're not the
1954160	1959520	ignorant service. Exactly. They have secret in their name. So I wanted to do that. It turns out
1959520	1964560	they're just in charge of counterfeiting and, and, and projecting the president, I guess. I don't
1964560	1968960	know. No, they're, yeah, that, that, that, that is an interesting answer. Like I'm fascinated by
1968960	1973840	the secret service too. Like I wonder like what, what their definition of a good guy and a bad guy
1973840	1977920	is like what you're supposed to do. Like, like what if the president grabs a hammer and goes at
1977920	1982080	himself with the claw end of it? What's, what's your responsibility as a secret service guy? You
1982080	1986880	have to like jump between him and the hammer. Like you have to get in between the hammer and him.
1986880	1991440	Yeah. What if the whole time he's saying this is for the American people that I'm doing this,
1991440	1996000	there's a microchip in my head. Like, like, like, are you supposed to as a secret service guy be
1996000	2000640	like, that's impossible. You have to, right? Or are you supposed to be like, this is my boss. I,
2000640	2004640	presidents have like fevers and shit too. Sometimes only they wake up in cold sweats
2004640	2010640	saying crazy shit all the time. Like jump in front of that virus. He has to get right
2011360	2015680	in front of that sneeze that gave him that cold. And the big question is like when they, I remember
2015680	2021280	when Obama got elected, there was a kind of doubling up of a secret service efforts and
2021280	2027600	things, which was simultaneously like, it's kind of like by the millennial definitions, it's like,
2027600	2032800	oh, we're racist. We're noticing he's a black president. So let's, let's close ranks everybody.
2032800	2036880	It's like, like if you drifted further into the outfield when he came up to bat.
2039360	2044320	I have a friend from high school. My friend, Mike Carpio, who listens to the show, he drives a
2044320	2050000	cab in New York right now. He sent a postcard jokingly saying to a friend that was going to
2050000	2055120	Chicago when I think George Herbert Walker Bush was president saying like, Hey, you're gonna be
2055120	2060240	Chicago. Don't shoot the president while you're there. Haha. And a postcard the next morning,
2060880	2065200	knock on the door, two dudes in suits, secret service. And they gave him a hundred questions.
2065200	2069040	And among the questions were, are you homosexual? Are you a member of the communist party?
2069040	2073040	Like, and they should, they had the postcard. So they haven't changed their question here
2073040	2080560	from 1955. No, same, same spoiler plate. Like still, still, Hey, should we cut down on some of
2080560	2086480	these questions? Hey, what harm is there in knowing if someone's gay? That was someone at
2086480	2093360	the meeting. They're like, Hey, what do we, what do we want to know less? We'll wait for them to
2093360	2099440	sue us. Then we'll stop asking. The news doesn't loosen. Yeah, we drove all the way to Whittier.
2099440	2104640	We're not going to not know if they're gay or not. But, but I am fascinated with that. The idea of
2104640	2112480	what I was getting to is like, okay, the secret service, how much does it get flushed and switched
2112480	2123040	over for each president? Like they have to have a, they must have a, a professional code that
2123040	2128160	supersedes. Didn't, didn't a guy just resign? Like the head of the secret service just resigned,
2128160	2132400	I think. Is that, is that something I'm making up? Can't keep track. National, national security,
2132400	2137040	right? No, but a different guy. I think that specifically, I think the director of the secret
2137040	2141600	service. Right. I think that was early on. Personal reasons. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like what
2141600	2147840	I'm doing is literally called upstaging you. Like, Oh, Mike, by the way, I just got to check
2147840	2151840	if you need to hook into all your gear there. I have the DI. That's right. I gotta do the other
2151840	2157760	thing. The DI boxer. You need to hook into this because that's, that's your lead. How's everybody
2157760	2169120	doing? That's good. Read any good comic books. Now, when you get back on the mic, Mike, I want
2169120	2173440	to talk about all this gear you have here because you got loads of shit. That's why you brought a
2173440	2179120	stool. The stool is not just a power move. This is an actual functional tool. Yes. It's a thing
2179120	2185840	used for sitting. The reason why upstaging is a bad thing is because you, you stay back and you
2185840	2191040	make the other person go like this. You're fucking them over. If you hug the back wall,
2191040	2202080	I learned that in trauma club. Oh, upstaging. All right. So yeah, but I don't know. I was just,
2202080	2205520	okay, I, we don't have, we could, that was a graceful segue and I want to ruin it because
2205520	2208720	I still want to talk about the secret service because I just imagine it being a secret service
2208720	2212960	person. I'm like, okay. So then the guy comes in office. That's like, what if you're, what if you're,
2212960	2216560	I mean, what if your wife is Muslim? What if you, what if you like, like, like, it's like,
2216560	2220320	what, what do they do? What, what a secret service guy we'll do is we'll have a secret service guy
2220320	2229440	as a guest and we'll ask him all kinds of questions or her. You're welcome. Um, okay. Uh,
2229440	2234160	let's get, let's get into the, uh, wrapping portion of our show, which should last for now
2234160	2241440	until nine, uh, 90 minutes from now. So, so how do we want to do this? I got, I got a bunch of
2241440	2246320	shit that can be done. Just what do we want to do? Let's just, let's just, let's just have an
2246320	2251600	open source process. Start by giving me a beat. Giving you a beat. All right. Let's see.
2253280	2257120	How did you guys meet while Mike's putting this together? You guys do what show?
2257120	2263280	It's funny. We re we are, uh, we were both, uh, I was a rogue cop and then
2263280	2270800	I had to say hello to my new partner. Now we, we, we, we just did the show.
2273040	2275040	Are you making beats on the, on the flag?
2283920	2287040	Now, are you going to lay down some stuff that you already have written or are you going to
2287040	2291760	have a freestyle for us? I don't know. Well, I'm not having anything written to this.
2292560	2294960	You don't have anything written to this. Not to this. I do.
2297920	2309360	Well, when you rap, you rap with your heart. You do your best to do your rapping part
2309360	2322880	because rap music is never going anywhere. It's in all of the water, the fire, the wind and your
2322880	2332400	hair mislead. Well, I'm a rapping man and I'm here to sing. I want to rap about everything,
2332400	2342640	but I can't not yet till I get a harmony in my heart. I want to do my part. So I bought a gun
2342640	2352480	for some reason. The president's committing treason just by sitting in that office. I hear
2352480	2362640	him cough this and I think, is he going to die? And then I wonder why I'd be happy for somebody
2362640	2372080	to be in pain. I'm on the hate train. My name is motherfucking MC. I'm going to put every vitamin
2372080	2379040	inside of my pee. I'm going to drink it down and pee it out because that's what a recycling
2379040	2385760	syndrome is about. If you're only drinking pee, then water is pee. And if you pee it out, it's twice
2385760	2394000	as much pee you see. So you got to seek effervescent freshness. You got to get back to what the quest
2394000	2400480	was. You can pee in Texas and you can pee on extras. And if you can't pee long, you should
2400480	2408000	stretch it out like I do because I got a really small bladder. So I pee longer than I have to
2408000	2414000	in the bathroom. I let people think I'm still going when I'm flowing, even though nothing is
2414000	2429360	showing. Fuck it. Oh shit. Well, now what do we do? That's the danger of rapping when you also
2429360	2434160	are in control of how long the beats go. Yeah. It's also the danger of rapping that early in the
2434160	2439120	show. I mean, how are we going to follow that with our bullshit? Dan, you just dropped four dollars.
2439120	2443920	I guess with cash prices. Hello. That's like in video games when you beat someone up and they drop
2443920	2458880	money. I want to hear more, just more like, you know, rapping. More rapping. More extemporaneous
2458880	2464800	freestyle. That was a nice beat. That was good. All right. So these are all beats that you made
2464800	2472640	up yourself? That one was a lot of this is other people's shit from our songs. And what should I
2472640	2481760	put on here? What should we call that last rap? Well, doing the rapping part. Oh yeah. That hook
2481760	2491840	was great. That's great. Is there any significance to the name Open Mike Eagle? Yeah. He sounds a
2491840	2499440	little bummed out about that. I pressed the opposite of a button. I found the armchair snooze
2499440	2506720	setting. It bored you to death. No, it's not boredom. It's just that I should have a way
2506720	2514640	better answer. And the truth is my government name is Michael Eagle. Oh, okay. That's it.
2515520	2524160	It's fucking Mike Eagle and a rap a bunch at Open Mikes. And so then I just smashed all that
2524160	2531680	shit together. But you didn't feel like Mike Eagle wasn't cool enough? You know what? That's the best
2531680	2537600	name in the world. In retrospect, you're correct. It would be the thing to do now. Like if you
2537600	2544400	started now, it's the 2003 or whatever. I think about it every day. If you call yourself Mike
2544400	2548240	Eagle, people will think you made that up. When you say my name is Open Mike Eagle, they go,
2548240	2554640	oh, his name was Mike Eagle. He's ashamed of it. He doesn't believe that that's enough. I didn't.
2554640	2557280	I was overcompensating and got stuck in it forever.
2559840	2563360	But you can be like John Cougar Mellencamp and just drop the Cougar at some point.
2563360	2566160	Did he drop it? I don't know what the arc was with that shit at all.
2566160	2569840	Because he was Johnny Cougar for a while. And it was John Cougar Mellencamp,
2569840	2574080	but I think he just went to John Mellencamp. That was a great decision. Yeah. I'm going to
2574080	2578400	draw upon his strength because the Cougar was thrust upon him. But Eagle, you were born with
2578400	2584320	the Eagle. I was. Yeah. So you can't escape your destiny. I mean, I like it. I just didn't realize
2584320	2590400	it was enough. Mike Eagle. I can't feel like you know what it is. It's my dad's name too.
2591120	2594320	So I never thought it was fucking special. So you're Mike Eagle, Mike Eagle Jr.
2594320	2599360	The second or whatever the fuck. Yeah, that's fucked up. Mike Eagle, you have to either be
2600160	2606640	like a like film noir detective or a stripper because Mike Eagle is good. That's a great name.
2606640	2612800	I feel like I'm in between the Mike Eagle novels. What? You could write a series of
2612800	2619280	detective novels with Mike Eagle. Like Sam Spade and fucking Deshil Hammett. I think
2619280	2627520	if he were to be a detective, I think it would go something like this. Put a beat on. Shit.
2627520	2634960	Before you get peed on. Beats and P. God damn it. That's the name of this segment.
2634960	2644320	I like this one a lot. Stakes your hide, Dan.
2651840	2653120	Just giving it like I said.
2664960	2673200	This is a sample from They Might Be Giants by the way. Oh yeah. The last one was too.
2673200	2677440	Down, down, down you go.
2685440	2686480	Hear me call.
2696080	2699360	Dan doesn't like this one. No, I think he does.
2699360	2701120	I like it too much. I'm sorry. I was just listening.
2703920	2705920	You put it to sleep like a shark upside down.
2729360	2738800	She turned into a guy named Ryland. Like a nephew of my girlfriend. It's a real name.
2740880	2746720	Is your name Ryland or Ryland? Is it Ryland with a D or Ryland? It confuses people.
2748080	2756240	Choose better names for your children. If it's Stephanie, spell it S-T-E-P-H-A-N-I-E.
2756240	2759280	That's how we know how to spell it. If you fuck with that,
2759280	2762240	you're going to doom your kid to a life of correcting people.
2767120	2773520	But if you name your kid Woobajoo, spell it how? Woobajoo.
2774480	2778640	How you want to spell it Woobajoo. You're an inventor. You're Thomas Edison.
2779280	2783920	Pucked your mama so hard that led us into the kitchen like a vampire.
2784000	2788400	Pucked your mama till I changed your pussy's tires. I jacked it up. I put it down.
2788400	2792400	I changed the lug nuts and drove her ass around. I treated her with respect.
2794560	2799600	Then the car wrecked. Took it back to Avis. Said, I don't know what happened.
2802640	2809760	Take it, Mike. Yeah. I know what happened. There's a lot to unpack. Yes.
2810240	2818880	Yes. There's condoms in the back seats. Why? I don't know. I had acne. He fucked my mother
2818880	2824880	like some type of athlete or my mom. Why did I personalize it? I don't know. I don't have to.
2824880	2830960	It could be your mom or your mom. It could be somebody's mom in Vietnam. Anywhere.
2831760	2834640	There's nothing stopping this man from fucking anybody's mother.
2835120	2840640	And this is the truth I have finally discovered right now. But he fucked all of our mothers.
2840640	2848000	So that means all of us are sisters and brothers. He is a man of many lovers, as he has said,
2848000	2854880	as he repeated. And as he said, he excreted all over nasty back seats. And then he returned the
2854880	2861440	car like nothing happened and it was full of used prophylactics. I'm like, dude, that's disgusting.
2861440	2867760	Look at the semen you've erupted. It's like all over the upholstery. What is this supposed to be?
2869760	2872720	And he still had to pay full price plus a cleaning fee
2874640	2877520	because the people were like, we're not cleaning semen or cleaning pee.
2880320	2882160	Because it's all about his liquids.
2882160	2890080	Because I'm ubiquitous with my liquidus. I'm going to evict this administrativeness
2890800	2897920	from the ovalophonous of this coffinous. I want to put it in the sarcophagus. I got the pillars.
2897920	2902800	I got the house. I want to creep in there like a tiny mouse. I got superpowers going to shrink
2902800	2907760	my ass down. Going to go to the oval office and go to ground round. It's a restaurant chain in the
2907760	2918240	Midwest. In the Midwest, we kick fresh. And I'm fucking with incest. They small like insects.
2918240	2924560	Hide them like Whitsack. Witness. Protection. That's how we do it. Strangled in here or any
2924560	2930880	section. Been like the midsection. Maybe torso. Fingers get in their head like cornrows. We're
2930880	2937040	twisting. Just watch how we blow like ballistic missiles. Cause this shit's wild, not an exile.
2937040	2943040	Put flows together like textiles. Smile for miles. Never stopping. I'm tech poppin' with
2943040	2947920	the news in prime time. But lights shine. Ain't no one to stand for the tenth time. Break it down
2947920	2953840	like enzymes when I get within rhymes. There's no space to be left between. Come back. Have them
2953840	2959520	dancing like Ben Vereen in their system. Got them hook addicted nicotine. They a small figurine.
2959520	2964400	I'm coming through pretty big pigs. Want to get shut down when I clown. And they don't want to
2964400	2970560	stand. This is that new SmackDown. Referee doing fast counts. One, two, three. They can't move me. MCs,
2970560	2974960	they think I'm in the Fuji's. But I'm watching. Show them double features in the movie. But it's
2974960	2981120	all this. It's all that. We are fat. The hitter with the bar back. It's fall start. They Walmart.
2981120	2986000	They generic. We just a cleric. We stare at them. They get embarrassed when we share this.
2986800	2987440	Free stuff.
2992320	2994160	I don't know how I do that.
2997680	3002160	I don't know how I do that.
3004640	3007280	Do you eat something special when you're growing up?
3007280	3016240	Is there a tree in your backyard that grows a special fruit?
3020640	3031600	Did you win an eBay auction that gave you a special lamp that you rubbed like a rapping genie?
3031600	3046000	Oh, what a meanie. I'm Kevin Meaney who passed away. He did passed away. I rap on a Saturday or Sunday.
3046000	3052000	I move the crowd like Feng Shui when people rig a maze of furniture. Yeah, I rap, but it's earlier.
3052000	3057040	I won't miss you earlier. That means I look through your window. I'll make you sick and large
3057120	3062400	and fucking lymph nodes like I was cancerous. MCs want to get pressed up like beats on a
3062400	3067520	master disc next to their name like Barry Bonds for the asterisk. After he hit the home run,
3067520	3072000	I am the show gunner. No one. I kill them like Africans with a blow gun when they're trying
3072000	3076720	to do what they do because they're predators. Open cut your words up like a newspaper editor
3076720	3082240	with iPad. I'm not drop dead Fred that old school movie from the 80s. MCs will try to slay me,
3082240	3086880	but they can't do nothing because they feel smart as a baby. But yeah, they got babies and they think
3086880	3092080	they sick. They want to come through with new shit, but they just miss how we do it. Hello.
3094800	3101040	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Jesus Christ. I'm just sitting over here,
3101040	3105440	checking you out because you run upholstery with supposed to be that made me very happy.
3105440	3108800	Incredible.
3110160	3118160	Fuck it. Oh, Vincent Price breakdown. Right. There's a like me doing the Vincent Price bridge.
3120560	3127760	Yes. Your upholstery is scintillating creepy.
3127760	3137840	The seat coverings are smotherings from the spiders delight. Oh shit. Ice tea is here too.
3139200	3146960	Yo, they personal. It's just business. Want to fuck your mother? What is this? I want to see your
3146960	3153360	pussy to her mouth. I fucked your model from the north to the south. It ain't personal. It's just
3153360	3164800	me. The bullet like a gun. You're telling me this motherfuckers done ice tea to the eye,
3164800	3171360	to the sea, to the E and every T and it rhymes. Everything rhymes with team. That's all me. Ice
3171360	3178720	team. Yeah. Yo, I got to go. I'm going to get an ice cream to don't confuse that with what my name
3178720	3187920	means. My name comes from the streets. Yo, my sore feet. They get sore when I walk. I fucked your
3187920	3198640	mama. Oh shit. Jimmy Stewart's here too. I saw your mama was outside.
3198640	3215680	Well, obviously I need a B. Oh yeah. That was kind of a smooth one. I like that.
3215680	3225360	We can take a break and talk about you again. Okay. Now that there's heightened interest in you.
3225440	3234480	Is there? Is that what happened? Some skills. So now we're at the point in your life,
3234480	3239280	you're being raised by your grandparents. Oh shit. Okay. Oh, I forgot that we were talking
3239280	3245520	about the past. There's a point. So where are you? You're not like a six year old on the playground
3245520	3250720	that's into hip hop, are you? No, I was into, I mean, this is the thing. Like where I grew up
3250720	3256720	and when I grew up rap was just there. Like rap was there. Like my older sister, my first rap I
3256720	3261760	heard, I got in my mom's car and she was playing fucking easy ease first album. It was fucking
3261760	3267680	1987. Oh yeah. You know what I mean? The suspense was making me sick. So I opened it up and the
3267680	3273360	bitch had a dick. I heard that in my mom's car when I was six and I was like, Oh my God, all these
3273360	3278560	girls wearing this is fucking great. But that's, that was just what was all around me. And so like
3278560	3283360	I never, I mean, at least at that point in my life, I wasn't like, Oh God, rap is awesome.
3283360	3289120	Cause it was just life. And so I actually escaped into like rock music and shit that I was seeing
3289120	3294160	on MTV. Did you associate rap at that age? You were kind of like, this is like almost like maybe
3294160	3298880	what I associated country Western with is like, this is my parents' music. This is grown up shit.
3298880	3304960	This is like, so did you reject it kind of? It wasn't so much that I rejected it. It was just
3304960	3311680	like the soundtrack of my surroundings. What was the first record or a rap group that you got into?
3311680	3316640	Like that was your own discovery of that. Your, your own shit. Tribe Called Quest. Oh yeah. So
3316640	3322160	all of that shit, like all of the day last level, Tribe Called Quest, the brand newbie. And I was
3322160	3326720	really bummed out on five. Yeah, man. I didn't realize until I read an article that day last
3326720	3331120	all, cause I was always like, what, why wasn't day last little fire? Why didn't it burn everything
3331200	3336160	down? And it was like, there was a, there was sampling legislation that happened that I had
3336160	3341440	no idea had anything to do with it. That a lot of their sound was like very, very. And they were
3341440	3347280	part of the original lawsuits that changed hip hop forever. Yeah. Like they had, they were sampling
3347280	3353840	like the turtles in just interludes and shit, but there was, there were no standing laws or no
3353840	3361680	history for how you go about punishing that. And so the copyright law for hip hop started with them
3361680	3368720	and started with Bismarck E. And then it became like illegal to the point where these, the record
3368720	3373040	labels and the guys who own those masters could sue for the amount of money that would just kill
3373040	3377360	a whole project. It could kill a whole label. It could put everybody in a bankruptcy and it changed
3377360	3381920	hip hop forever. That's why hip hop can't sound like it used to. Like the records that I grew up
3381920	3387760	loving are all illegal right now. You can't make any of those. Do you think that when we go to
3387760	3392960	music in general, even like maybe our grandparents went to Elvis for the same reason or a little
3392960	3397600	Richard or whatever, like, are we going to music when we're in the mood to fuck or fight? And that's
3397600	3405280	why conscientious music, like a message in your music, like it's going to never like win that
3405280	3410320	stock market battle where it's like, Hey, over here I got, I'm selling arrested development.
3410960	3417200	Like in the 90s, I was like, it seems so much harder and so much more worthwhile to try to
3417200	3422400	rise above the equally charismatic stuff, like that easy thing you're talking about.
3422400	3429360	I remember the white guys in the locker room, it's just like everyone knew it by syllable,
3429360	3434880	like everyone had it memorized and it infected everybody, I guess, because it was just for the
3434880	3441200	same reason that who knows, like what I'm doing the twist or whatever the fuck, like it's always
3441200	3444800	been, it's the same as rock and roll. It's like, Oh, they're talking about fucking and they're
3444800	3449840	talking about anger and they're talking about something my parents don't like. And this is
3449840	3455360	finally authentic and it's been too inauthentic and now it's authentic. But the problem is that
3455360	3459680	that authenticity never goes hand in hand with like, is this a question, Dan, is what you're
3459680	3465120	wondering? No, no, no, I think it makes perfect sense. Authenticity doesn't go hand in hand with
3465120	3470800	like, Oh, here's an idea. Authenticity tends to go hand in hand with I want to smash someone in
3470800	3477600	the face. I shot someone today. I'm horny. I mean, you know what it is with hip hop and I don't know
3478560	3484320	if this rock and roll too, but it's like out more with hip hop. I know that when I grew up
3484320	3487600	when hip hop was starting, there were hella options in terms of the type
3488320	3492720	of content you could get in a popular rap song. Even not upstaging. I'm getting drink.
3492720	3499600	It's okay. Uh, you could have, uh, NWA and you can have public enemy and all of that was able to
3499600	3507120	exist in the same space. What I think happened with rap music is that ultimately the rap music
3507120	3514160	that aligns more with like our overarching cultural values, it becomes easier for that
3514240	3519360	to spread than things that are talking about going against that. Do you think part of it is because
3520000	3527360	if guys are rapping about being poor and how they'll always be poor and how being poor makes
3527360	3533600	them angry and how they, they, and the, the, the, the kind of, uh, lower class lifestyle being
3533600	3540080	maybe not necessarily applauded by the, the protagonist in the music, but certainly being
3540080	3546800	coped with being celebrated. Do you think that maybe part of it is because that's a, uh,
3547360	3556480	that's easy to digest for everybody, including people who can stay racist and like good music?
3557040	3560480	Right. And, and, but what, what I'm saying is specifically about rap music is like,
3560480	3566400	cause if you look at like, uh, Dr. Dre is the chronic out and that album changed like everything
3566400	3574480	because it was one of the first times where, uh, a high profile rap release was overtly about like
3575200	3580720	fucking and money. And like you said, shit that people could identify with no matter if they
3581520	3585920	liked or identify with the people making it or not, they could identify with those
3585920	3593040	values. Like those are cultural values overall. And I feel like once people are able to dial into
3593040	3597920	that, then that shows the, the mode of hip hop that was able to become more dominant. Right.
3599920	3604800	There's two different areas here. And I'm, cause it's like the thing that I always hear over and
3604800	3609120	over about that, that, that historical era of hip hop was like, Oh, well the white people flooded
3609120	3615520	in like, like, let the suburban white kids that don't, it's not identifiable, but it's still
3615520	3620560	charismatic. Well, the music was good. Cause like, I mean, like I was a suburban, I still am a
3620560	3628080	suburban white kid. Uh, like EPMD, Eric B and Rakim, NWA, um, too short, like all, all like the,
3628080	3632880	the West coast stuff. Like we all listened to it because the music was good. Like the quality was
3632880	3638240	really good. The production values were really good. And, and their records, um, were actual
3638240	3643200	albums. Like, like the whole record said, uh, said something. It wasn't just a bunch of bullshit
3643760	3647680	and rock and roll wasn't doing it then. Like the rock and roll had kind of gone away.
3647680	3654720	So we rejoin open mic Eagles biopic. Uh, you, you're, you're hearing tribe called quest the
3654720	3659680	first time. So, and, and, and we're still, as far as I know, because I want to hear the point where
3659680	3667440	you actually are seduced by hip hop. Okay. That's high school for me because I first identified
3667440	3672800	with like tribe called quest, Panita Applebaum, like, and I'm seeing images of people of like
3672800	3679840	black people who like are cool, but they're not like, I'm trying to be hard. Cool. They're like,
3679840	3685120	I'm, it's okay for me to be unique. It's okay for me to rock these weird Afro centric baggy.
3685120	3691680	And I wasn't able to do that either, but I saw like self-confident people who weren't like trying
3691680	3696320	to portray like the hardest image. And to me that created a space like, Oh, wait a minute. There's
3696320	3702240	room for me in this culture too. Cause I wasn't reflecting those other values either. So that was
3702240	3708560	the first thing. And then in Chicago on the South side in high school there was this place called
3708560	3714880	Promontory Point. It was this park district where they had this like city sanctioned breakdancing
3714880	3721760	class. But what the hip hop community in this city used this as this meeting point for people
3721760	3726880	who were into all of the hip hop arts. So people who were doing graffiti, people who were freestyle
3726880	3731360	rapping and people who were breakdancing, people who were DJing, they all got together at this place
3731360	3736720	every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon. And like that just flicks something in my head. Like, Oh,
3736720	3740800	wait a minute. Like this is not just some shit to listen to. It's some shit you can actually do.
3740800	3744880	Right. And like taking that layer of distance away from it and making it something that I had an
3744880	3751440	entry or access point into. Maybe intellectualizing it. Maybe, but not to that sounds punitive to you,
3751440	3759680	but like, that's how I experienced emotion. I need to logically realize that it's the right
3759680	3766560	thing to do, that it makes sense to do it, that it's strategically, that it doesn't compromise me,
3766560	3771040	that it doesn't take anything away from me, that it's a proper way for me to... It's like, Oh,
3771040	3777760	hugging my girlfriend is a way to maintain that. Like, I'm just wondering maybe if you're, you know,
3777760	3782480	if you're a verbal thinker, if you're a logical thinker, you grow up in that atmosphere and you're
3782480	3787840	like, then in that moment, you're like, wait a minute. And if I could speculate going like,
3787840	3792320	because something that I had to, like back then I remember going like, somebody had to tell me,
3792320	3798560	or I read it somewhere. They're like, no, don't you understand that, that, that, that going like
3798560	3805040	this with a record in the eighties is, is like the only recourse we've provided kids that used to
3805040	3812560	get tuba lessons. And that all of the sampling and all and everything, beatboxing, wrapping itself,
3812560	3820000	everything, all of it is, it's an expression of it's like banging on pipes underneath the fucking
3820000	3825040	subterranean, not underneath the subterranean thing that would, don't, don't let me do this.
3826400	3831360	It's, it's, it's that I was like, Oh, shit, like I had to have a logical, I kind of have to
3831360	3836720	parse it in sci fi terms myself. I'm always like, Oh, wait, okay, this is the robots. And these are
3836720	3841760	the people. And this is how we fight. And this is what we do. And maybe that happened to you kind of
3841760	3845600	in that moment where you're like, wait a minute, what do what do all these things have in common?
3846400	3850560	They're, they're unsanctioned, right? They're not what was the threshold for you,
3850560	3854800	Mike, when you listened to stuff, you got turned on by that music. And then you started saying,
3854800	3859280	okay, now I have to go get equipment and start making it myself. Like, how old were you?
3859840	3867360	I started rapping just to 16. Right. So and I was seeing people rap at that place freestyling,
3867360	3871920	we're getting in circles and freestyle rhyming. And so like me and my friends in high school
3871920	3878000	decided we were going to do that. And so from like the age of 16 to like 24, all the rap I ever did
3878000	3883120	was freestyle. So that's why you're better. I started at 42. Well, then yeah. 10,000 hours,
3883120	3886640	you know what I mean? That's not true, Dan, you've been doing it since you were 20. And you've been
3886640	3893600	bad at it the whole time. I started taking it seriously last week. Can you give Dan some
3893600	3898640	pointers? Because tell him to stop saying the word mouth, because he knows he's just going to
3898640	3904960	have to say south after that. But there's certain pitfalls that you fall into every time. Do you
3904960	3910320	rap a lot for real? I in the show, I do. Okay. And I truly in this show, I'm like, I'm like,
3910320	3915200	like, because it's been it started as a gimmick in the show, the idea was I rap badly. I only by
3915200	3919840	virtue of doing the show every week for years. I'm getting a little bit better. Don't tell anyone I
3919840	3925040	said that. I'm not. But it's just practicing. It's like light training. And that's all it is.
3925040	3928960	You have your moment, Dan. Once in a while, Dan will lay down a really good rhyme.
3930320	3933840	Well, that's the thing. It's like, that's the thing that fascinates me about rap, because unlike
3933840	3939120	piano lessons, which I regret ever bailing on and stuff. But here's this thing where it's like,
3939120	3946960	you taught, there's people who labor, it's like, your, like people, the relationship between
3946960	3953520	freestyle and writing raps is just really fascinating to me. It deep core fracks the
3953520	3958320	fascination. I'm not drunk. I'm just making up new words like Shakespeare. Also, it's 9-11.
3960800	3964080	Don't let that alarm you. Oh, it's a little scary. Yeah, it's a little scary.
3966720	3970560	Let me remind you that it's still scary. Just so you know, our fans are crazy people.
3970560	3974240	They're crazy. Well, here's the thing you did just before you launched into your most,
3974320	3978480	when we were doing it before. I was like babbling and I was doing bits and I'm like,
3978480	3985600	oh, blah, blah, blah. And then like, it was literally, I watched you, like, I said, like,
3986320	3992480	sassafras. And then you were like, I'm going to start rapping. I saw that on your face. And then
3992480	3997680	I, because I was just like, and by sassafras, I mean pineapple. And you're like pineapple,
3997680	4004000	apple, apple, but like you, you did, you could have gotten away with in my gut. In your head,
4004000	4009920	you, you had the option of going with sassafras as a point of departure, but you were committed to
4010640	4017760	a last dragon like flow. Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, that's, that's all it is. You know,
4017760	4022880	it's, it's just making connections, you know, but in real time, that's all it is is making like in
4023760	4030320	and the enemy is starting to think. No, the enemy is stopping. That's the only enemy is stopping.
4030320	4034480	You just keep going. Just like when me and my friends first started, but I didn't hear you
4034480	4038720	horrible. Okay. And what we used to do, we would get on the phone and call each other old school
4038720	4045040	three way, right? With no beat. And we would just start rapping. We were fucking awful. And we,
4045040	4049920	and our whole thing was just don't fucking stop. All right. And then like, what you started to do
4049920	4054960	after a while is built that catalog of words. So then it's not mouth and South. It's about trout
4054960	4061360	route and gout and the rhymes don't have to be actual complete rhymes. It can be sounds. It's,
4061360	4066560	it's, you're just riffing on sounds. Yeah, you don't even have to rhyme. You just got to keep
4066560	4071040	going. Some of the best lyrics in music history. Uh, there are no rhymes. There's a song called
4071040	4075440	moonlight in Vermont, which is a beautiful lyric and there's no rhyme in it. And you don't notice
4075440	4084240	that it's just a great, it's a, it's a beautiful lyric. It's a poem somebody requested. I can't
4084240	4089120	sing. We'll get sued. I was in, uh, I did this study with the national institutes of health.
4089120	4096480	I freestyled in an MRI machine. Yeah, I did. And like, and they, and, and we, I'm a co-author on
4096480	4102160	a fucking national institute to health study about improvisation or freestyle. You, you got an MRI
4102160	4106560	while you were freestyling? Yeah, yeah. No, like they bloated me in the machine. Can I make a guess?
4106560	4112800	I'll probably be wrong, but I would guess because words appear as for me, uh, they're visual.
4114640	4119040	Does the same part of like facial recognition and like, like, like, like spatial recognition come up?
4119040	4123120	Like what, what part of your brain lit up in the MRI? Well, they said, okay. So they've been studying
4123120	4128000	this cause they started with studying like, uh, improvisational pianists in there. So they had
4128000	4133840	this little keyboard you can put in there. Um, so like they're, they're trying to, uh, figure out
4133840	4138240	the brain parts that are active when people reach what's called the flow state. And that's any
4138240	4143280	improvisation. This is not a lead with this. No, you mean it's a go, go, go, keep going, keep going.
4143280	4149440	But, um, uh, it's, and so what they say is like language turns on, but like forethought,
4149440	4155200	like the normal frontal lobe thought turns off and you start thinking with like more reptilian
4155200	4160320	brain because you don't, you like, because you can't overthink it. Like you said, but you're still
4160320	4165040	using language. It's like your reptile brain is shooting lightning through the forebrain,
4165040	4169040	but the forebrain is being used as a fucking silencer and a pistol or any other tool. It's
4169040	4174880	like, uh, it's like, it's, it's turned like, man, I, unfortunately, the results were filled with
4174880	4179840	jargon that I didn't understand at all on your part. You mean in your wraps where you're like,
4179840	4185920	I'm in an MRI and I got a dick in my eye. How do you not wrap about being in the MRI machine?
4185920	4195200	At least for the first 10 minutes. I feel my optic nerve heating up. I feel my frontal lobe cooling
4195200	4202000	dead. And you're like, I'm trying too hard. Pull me out. Pull me out. All right. But what, what part
4202000	4207680	of the brain is active when you're in the flow state? Like that's the thing. It's a combination
4207680	4212880	of lobes and I, and I'll have to like, I'd have to like send you the shit. Cause like the front
4212880	4217520	part turns off and a couple of this like parietal temporal turn off. Like it's, it's, it was a
4217520	4222640	complicated thing that they were showing happens. They put like chess players, like chess masters
4222640	4230480	under a cast cancer MRIs and the, they showed them images of chess boards, like of a game,
4231040	4236240	like in a like middle game or end game or early game, like, like openings and stuff like that.
4236240	4240240	And the same part of their brain lit up. That is the same part of your brain that lights up when
4240240	4244160	you see a face that you recognize and you go, Oh, that's Dan Harmon. Oh, that's Mike. Oh, that's
4244160	4252480	Spencer. They see chess boards as people spending a lot more time in MRI machines. Like, like, like,
4252480	4258000	this technology is important. Like we should all just be spending like six hours a day in MRI
4258000	4262560	machines and pooling the results. They get a lot of money to put shit in MRI machines and see what
4262560	4266080	happens. Like Dan, you were saying that you got better. Like you've been getting better at, at
4266800	4271840	being in the flow state wrapping over time because you can actually rewire the synapses to create
4272960	4276320	new, new flow. Well, that's what I think is interesting. It's like, well, because remember
4276320	4282000	this, the Ken Kesey metaphor that you told me about, like you ever read electric Kool-Aid
4282000	4290000	acid tests? Ken Kesey, he had this metaphor that, that for being in the moment, which was like,
4290000	4293520	which is the same thing you're talking about this flow state. His metaphor was that you walk up to
4293520	4299440	a player piano with the role going and that you, of course, if you didn't know how to play piano,
4299440	4305280	you'd be like, you could try to play this weird game where you tried to like imitate the keys.
4305280	4312560	And this is also in Westworld's title sequence. But, but, but that you, that, that Ken Kesey
4312560	4320400	had this like concept of if you take enough acid or, or if you get enough in the moment,
4321040	4324960	your fingers fall into those. Your fingers will start to get so fast because you,
4324960	4329360	because what's stopping you is thinking about observing the keys and blah, blah, blah.
4329360	4335120	And then, but then, but then the, the further philosophical concept was that you could,
4335120	4340720	you could get into that state so much that you could finish the song and then look up and see
4340720	4345600	that the player role had, didn't have the end of the song on it, that you had known the song itself.
4346400	4351120	So it's the same thing. And Olympic athletes say essentially the same thing, like, like,
4351120	4355440	because people want to know for very good reasons, how the fuck did you jump that high?
4355440	4358960	I mean, but isn't, isn't it similar with writing too, though? Because like, I'm
4358960	4361280	sure people like to think so. Right. Most people can't,
4362240	4365920	most people can't like consciously remember like the mind state they were in when they
4365920	4370000	wrote their best shit or had their best ideas. Like kind of, you just, you're in the moment so
4370000	4373440	much that you kind of separate from it. Even when I have an amazing show like this one,
4373440	4377840	I'm in a total blackout. I don't know what's going on. I'll find out later that we won a podcasty.
4379680	4385120	No, but it, yeah, it's, and that's what that, that, that's what's interesting to note is that
4385120	4391440	it practicing shit, it so often has to do with actually, you have to learn some shit,
4391440	4396160	but then it's like, you got to unlearn thinking about it.
4396880	4404000	They say that like, like, like learning a craft, like learning piano. If there's genius inside you,
4404000	4410960	the craft will liberate the genius. So working on something, like working on rhyming, working on
4410960	4419600	music, working on writing, the hard work that it takes will liberate the genius inside you
4419600	4423440	that was always there. Well, can we try an exercise? Let's just go back and forth,
4423440	4428720	like doing banjo style. Okay. You can just like, you're teaching me to drive. You just do a little
4428720	4433680	bit. Like what's the definite, what's a good, like short attention span. You do like a couple of,
4434960	4438320	do a little bit and then I'll do a little bit. And then you do a little bit. We're going,
4438320	4444640	we're going to beat or we're going to acapella. Oh, should we go acapella? I mean, we can just,
4444640	4449520	you know, I say put, put a real simple beat on. I got one of them, but you,
4449520	4455920	yours are going to be better. I'm sure you got what you got. Well, as a Harry, Harry Foster,
4455920	4460160	he, he gave us some beats. You want, you want to try one of his, uh, yeah, then we'd have to switch
4460160	4464400	to, you know, you do yours because you, you, you get, you have your finger on the knob a little
4464400	4476880	better over there. Red leather, yellow leather, hip hop to the hipity hop. Dan, can I give you
4476880	4483440	some improv advice? Overthink it. That's so good. Have you just came up with that right now?
4485680	4488560	Look, look, look, look, Mike, he's already, he's already freaking out.
4488560	4491520	Tells this. No, I'm losing it. Look at me. I'm like the air.
4493840	4501200	I am the sun, I'm the air. Um, shit, I don't know what I got.
4501920	4505760	Yo, I'm not even saying yo, because I'm not thinking about it.
4507920	4516480	I like this one. Well, well, water, ocean waves, sky, fuck your mama that came in her eye. Okay.
4517680	4520960	See now, why does it always have to be fucking somebody's? I don't know. Because I think about
4520960	4526720	that because it's edible. Okay. But look, but look, but look, but look, I'll stop you right there
4526720	4530880	because you're doing something that a lot of freestyle rappers do. It's called, it's called
4530880	4540080	having a crutch. But like, but like, no, no, no, that's not, that wasn't meant to deflate.
4541040	4547200	Um, like mine used to be, when I first started, mine used to be when I'm on the mic, right?
4548160	4552720	It'd be like my name is Mike Eagle. When I'm on the mic, I say hi to people. Like, you know what I mean?
4553440	4560560	Every fucking bar was that. But that's some people do when yours happens to be fucking your mama.
4560560	4563680	Second verse, same as the first. A little bit louder.
4563680	4565600	Well, my name's Jeff Davis and I'm here to say it.
4565600	4570240	All right, well, so how do you deal with crutches? Did you take a hacksaw to them?
4570240	4574640	Yeah, you become conscious of them and you just try not to, but it's there for a reason because
4574640	4580880	we do that to help us fill the time between what we said and where we have to get to.
4580880	4589280	So, so like my therapist would say when she takes me through meditation, she says a thousand times
4589280	4593920	your mind will wander a thousand times. It can come back. Bring it back. So if I say,
4593920	4599840	fuck your mama, you guys don't start like booing and throwing chairs. It's, it's, it's my mind.
4599840	4605200	I got back into the old habit, but, and you note it and you become increasingly aware of the crutch
4605200	4609680	because what you'll do, you'll just find other ways to get to where you have to get with the timing
4609680	4616080	and you just won't say that particular thing every time. All right. By the year 2017, it's now
4617760	4619840	I'm not going to fuck anyone's mama in a wrap.
4624080	4624480	Rapping.
4624480	4633760	It's not easy, people. It's not easy.
4634960	4642320	I saw pepper, fork, spoon. Oh, sun in the moon. I got a solar system. It's going round and round.
4642320	4646720	I got my voice in my brain and the brain is the sound. I gotta flow through the rap. I gotta
4646720	4650960	flow through the people. Here's the motherfucking church and I don't go to the steeple cause I go
4650960	4656240	to the ultra and I pray to God. I drop down to my knees and I let him through my body.
4656240	4661040	I want to get down with you to the break of dawn.
4664960	4670000	Go, Mike. Go, Mike. Hey, he didn't fuck one mother in that at all.
4672960	4675760	No mother's reflection in the course of that rap.
4675760	4682480	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No mother's was fucked. No uppercuts. Make bread like the company butternut
4682480	4687200	with the squash. How we do it when we wash some seeds that they did old when they come through
4687200	4692800	getting washed and yeah, gotta stop and take it back. That's how we do it because the flows never
4692800	4697920	wack. But how we do it, that's another crutch that you can go back to that one and try not to say it
4697920	4704560	so much. Yeah. Yeah. Not so much. You don't do much and you don't do such. If you don't do what
4704560	4707840	you're supposed to do, then you do what you're gonna do. If you don't do what you're gonna do,
4707840	4712800	you do what you've always done. I'm gonna have fun and run in the sun. I'm gonna be on the beach and
4712800	4718640	make another one of my buns by cooking it in an oven and I'm putting in the shoving with my dick
4718640	4725680	and okay. Yeah. You put your dick in the muffin if you want to. Fuck the bread impromptu. Yeah.
4726640	4732080	That's how you gotta do it. That's how we doing when we making the new music. It's translucent.
4732080	4737600	Stay through your own brain patterns from here to Saturn. It doesn't matter. We can scatter just
4737600	4743440	like scattagories and you can listen to this new rapping story. What? Whoa. Rapping still like a
4743440	4748880	table. If you're mama, it's a fucking what do I tell you? All right. Take it easy. Go with the flow.
4748880	4753200	You're gonna laugh at some things. I'm gonna go high and low. I'm not thinking about what I'm
4753200	4758720	saying anymore. I'm gonna, I'm praying for what I want to go through the door. I want God to come
4758720	4764240	in and light us up. I want to suck the devil's dick and spit it up into the devil's face until
4764240	4769280	he comes from his eyes. I want to give you all a spiritual surprise. I want to go up to heaven
4769280	4774960	and pray to God. I'm gonna say everybody come down and General Zod's gonna fight Superman, but he
4774960	4780240	can't win. It doesn't matter who he brings. Superman's gonna win. He's gonna shoot him with his laser
4780240	4789760	eyes. Christopher Reeves died. We didn't want him to. We didn't want him to. Oh yeah.
4794560	4800000	That was a breakthrough. That was a breakthrough first. That was great. That was fucking yeah.
4803600	4808960	I wanted Spencer to rap. Spencer's not gonna rap at all. I'm not good at it. You gave Dan
4809920	4816640	you gave him freedom to freefall a bit. Yeah, man. There's that feeling of abandon there.
4816640	4820400	That's right. Yeah, I feel like you need to come back every week so I can have therapy
4820400	4828000	sessions like that. I'll come back like two weeks. Okay. All right, good. All right. Well,
4828000	4833440	we have technically a half hour left until the show ends when we usually end it. We usually end
4833440	4840560	it with a rap. Well, I do actually perform rap songs professionally, so if I could do...
4840560	4849280	This is a good time for a musical guest. All right. Like you. I'm here. Open my eagle. How much
4849280	4854800	should I do? Should I just do... I'll do very much money. That's a great call. I was gonna do that
4854800	4858960	anyway. Does it make you nervous for me to be sitting here or should I go off stage? No, no,
4859200	4863920	this is fine. This is actually a very loving environment we've created and I really fucking
4863920	4879840	appreciate it, man. Yo, yo. Oh, sorry. Sorry.
4893920	4913520	Just need some help with the finance, but hello. My name is Mike Eagle. How the fuck
4913520	4915360	are you guys doing today?
5043920	5068720	Thank you, guys, man. Holy shit.
5073920	5087920	Amazing. You guys are very kind. So do you drink? Do you get high? I've been drinking
5087920	5093680	in front of you this entire time. I also usually get high, but I didn't know what the fuck was
5093680	5098960	gonna happen here and that's usually a really terrible time for me to get high when I don't
5098960	5102880	know what's gonna happen. Oh, yeah. No, yeah. I would freak. I don't usually get high before
5102880	5110080	the show because I'd be curious to go back and look and mark the ones where I got high.
5110960	5116880	I remember a long time ago, there was one show I did Coke before the show. Oh, Jesus. Yeah. Yeah,
5116880	5124800	I bought a gun. Did you come here to elect someone or did you come here to hear about fear
5124800	5135680	and weakness? Before Adderall became a permanent part of my life, I would do Coke if it was in my
5135680	5142400	pocket. Some people put it in my pocket. I'm not a rocket. I'm just a light socket shitting light
5142400	5146640	on the cocaine truth. I'm gonna fuck your momma like Don Bluth. I'm gonna fuck... No, I'm just
5146640	5155440	kidding. Say it to my face. Don Bluth is an animator. He's not a hater. He's a
5155440	5161520	celebrator. He did All Dogs Go to Heaven and he did the sequence from Xanadu where the bird had
5161520	5171760	the leg warmers on it. Wait, there's a full on drum kit there? That's fucking badass. Yeah,
5171840	5176560	dude. Like, each one of these on... Man, this shit is so goddamn complicated.
5178400	5185280	I love that. Yeah, you can hit any of them. You can hit any of them.
5186480	5189440	There's like 64 and he's just rested to one a lot.
5195200	5197600	Jeff's got skill. This is what the fuck Jeff's got.
5197600	5204720	There we go. Get funky. The things that are funny are happening
5204720	5208720	too fast for me to explain them. The first is that he walked up and said,
5208720	5213120	is this just a thing and did it? And then after a while you said, you can do it.
5215120	5217280	And then it was the fact that he was just hitting the line.
5218720	5222720	Show off for us a bit, Mike. Show us what that thing can do. Because it's a bunch of
5222720	5226960	white squares that don't say anything on it. You have to know where they are.
5226960	5240080	Like America. You have to program those white squares to make a beat of democracy.
5240640	5245200	This one, this one, this one is just, this is just noises.
5249200	5255440	So this one is a synth on here and there's also a drum pad on here. This one, okay. This one
5256400	5261280	is coordinated to here. Yeah. Cause okay. This was, that was page, this is page six.
5262320	5266640	This is page five. Okay. And that's coordinated to my software here.
5267760	5271840	So now when you press these buttons, it's triggering the shit from Ableton over here.
5271840	5288800	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, I fucked your mama last night.
5293760	5299360	But it's just a grid of squares. I mean, which I'm sure like some AMD J's use that,
5299360	5303760	that's just filled with farts. Yep. What does that call a soundboard?
5304880	5309840	This is, this is called a launch pad. All right. Is that the brand name? That's the,
5309840	5313760	for the kids out there that want to be an open mic eagle. It's a Novation launch pad mini.
5315200	5317760	All right. So there's one final chapter of your story though.
5318640	5322400	Okay. Because, because you're going to, you're going to die tonight. That's right.
5323680	5328000	I knew that. That's what Dan didn't tell you is that we kill all of our guests.
5328000	5332320	Yeah. No, but something, something took you. You were at that event. There were break dancers
5332320	5335920	there. There were people there and you're like, wait, did you ever do any break dancing, dude?
5336480	5345440	Um, I've dabbled. I bet. I mean, put a beat on so we can see some. I, I, I, I, I pop a little more
5345440	5351360	than I lock, but overall the popping and locking has been done. I actually, but I remember being
5351360	5356480	like, um, bat, like when I was like, probably, I don't know, I might've been seven, anywhere from
5356480	5363680	seven to nine years old. Like when, uh, when break-in and, uh, when, when it was like break
5363680	5368400	dancing was the thing is before your time, you're younger than me, but it was like, like, like the,
5369280	5375200	like everybody was going like break dancing. The latest thing in the streets is gangs no longer
5375200	5380880	have to have violence. They can solve their problems with dancing. Uh, and that was really
5380880	5384720	the way it was being, and there were all these movies coming out, like break in and break into
5384720	5389680	electric wiggle and all this stuff. And it was like, and my brother and I would, we recorded
5389680	5395440	the movies and we would play them back until the tape heads were seizing and the static,
5395440	5399600	the screen was almost static. And we were just trying to like, look at what the people were doing
5399600	5405520	and like, uh, like, but that's not how you become a break dancer. It turns out, you know, we did
5405520	5409840	pretty much the same shit because watch the same movies. We just had some people around us. We
5409840	5413440	actually knew what we were doing, knew what they were doing. So we watched them and we watched the
5413440	5418400	tapes and we just tried to emulate. But is there in Joseph Campbell's hero's journey,
5419920	5426000	we got you to the goddess point, which is where you go. Oh shit. Okay. I'm open Mike Eagle. I'm
5426000	5432960	not, I'm going to, I'm going to rap now. And so what follows that is usually a punishment of some
5432960	5438480	kind, some huge challenge. If your life has adhered to traditional story structure, was,
5438480	5442400	was there a point where you were massively challenged when you like entered the fray
5442400	5446000	and you're like, I'm going to, this is what I'm going to do now. What was there? I mean,
5446000	5451360	shit. I feel like I started with a challenge. You know what I mean? Like, that doesn't count.
5451360	5455440	Shit. That's like, that's like a hobbit saying like, it was hard to leave the Shire. We know
5456480	5462400	I'm asking you, I'm asking you, when did you get your ass kicked after you decided every day?
5464240	5468400	There wasn't a big one where after you were like, I'm open Mike Eagle, I'm going to rap.
5468400	5473120	And then like, was there any point where you were like, fuck, I'm fucking dead. I'm dead.
5473120	5480080	And then you were like, you woke up and you were like, I'm alive. It might be right now. Yeah. I
5480080	5486800	mean, it's, I guess it's okay for the answer to be no. Now, I mean, I really do feel like
5487680	5492960	my whole career path is like, I've signed up to take lumps every fucking day. Well,
5492960	5496800	that's what open mic is. So maybe let's talk about that. So like you step on stage,
5496960	5501600	what is that like? Do you remember the first time you went from making a decision? Like,
5503120	5508240	what do you do? Do you pace your living room, your grandparents basement and go like,
5508880	5512400	I'm rapping, I'm rapping, I'm rapping. At some point you signed up for an open mic.
5513280	5517920	Well, I used to host all the open mics at college and that's really when all that shit started.
5518720	5522880	So high school rapping on street corners, basically, and then going to college and
5522880	5527120	doing the same shit, finding the other people who get together and rap and break dance and all
5527120	5532960	that shit. Right. And then this band that I used to get on stage and freestyle with sometimes,
5532960	5536960	because in the early part of my career, that's what a show was for me was showing up somewhere
5536960	5540720	where somebody else had music and fucking freestyling. That's all I knew how to do.
5540720	5544880	They wanted to book me. They wanted to build me and they wanted to pay me, but they were like,
5544880	5552400	you got to have a fucking song so you can perform. And so I had to write four songs
5552400	5557520	and memorize them so that I could perform on a show and not just be like Mr. Freestyle guy.
5558640	5561360	Have you ever been booed? How hard does it get?
5561360	5568400	I've never been booed, but I've been ignored. Then that's how my shit tends to be, is people
5568400	5571760	don't like me. They don't usually feel the need to come up to me and say, I don't like you. They
5571760	5575280	just fucking do some other shit and don't you know what I mean? It's kind of the worst.
5575280	5579360	Don't pay attention. I did shitty improv in Milwaukee and like the way you were on fire,
5579360	5584880	you were on fire. And then the worst moments were actually just the sound of dinner plates
5584880	5589040	clanking. That's how people clearing their throats. Someone walking up and going, uh,
5589040	5594080	when is this over? Right. I would open for people, you know, like I would get books open
5594080	5597600	for people who had fans and I didn't have any. So I was trying to get theirs and they were like,
5597600	5606560	no, we don't like you at all. Do you, like, do you have a zone that you go to? If you were
5606560	5611520	to walk into a venue and be like, all right, there's three people here and they didn't expect
5611520	5617280	you to show up. Would you be able to just do what you do? Or are you like a slave to like
5617280	5621920	people's, like what the venue is? I don't know if I understand that question. Well,
5622480	5626000	does it, how much does it affect you? Like, like the energy of the room? Like,
5626000	5632160	Oh, uh, a lot, honestly. Um, you know, and I do a lot of shit in,
5632160	5636320	what if I told everyone here to just boo you for two minutes while you did it? I don't know.
5636320	5639920	What am I, what am I doing? Yeah. Why are you thinking? I thought it would be a fun experiment,
5639920	5644720	like a weird, like boo and you're rapping. I heard a good story. Uh, my friend, Wayne Brady,
5644720	5650640	who does who's line, uh, he, he was doing some, um, some corporate events, like some big company,
5650640	5656320	like, like, like a major corporation and they had all the money in the world. And the main stage
5656320	5664320	that was a room for like maybe five, 10,000 people was for Huey Lewis and the news. And because it
5664320	5669840	was the end of this corporate weekend, nobody came because they all want to go home or, you know,
5669840	5674080	fuck about, go to the bar, do their thing. And nobody was there except for like, you know,
5674080	5680000	30 people in the front row. And there was this giant empty warehouse of a, of a, of a space
5680640	5684800	that they had paid, you know, Huey Lewis and his band, like, you know, couple hundred grand
5684800	5690800	to play at. And Wayne said, he went there and he said, they played like it was Madison Square Garden.
5690800	5696720	They completely fucking did it. Like there was a sea of people there and they played as hard as
5696720	5703120	they would have as like, if it were filled. And that was the most show busy thing he'd ever seen.
5703120	5707600	Like people saying like, like, like, no, like, like I got my money. My job is to come up here
5707600	5713120	and perform. Fuck the audience. Fuck the, fuck the turnout. Our job is to get up here and play.
5713120	5719600	And like Huey Lewis and the news is a shitty band. They're not great, but the views of Jeff
5719600	5727920	Davis do not reflect Harman John the podcast. But, but I give that band a hundred percent
5727920	5731840	credit for being absolutely amazing. Because I want to, but also I just want to quibble. That's
5731840	5736080	not necessarily for a person who's performed for two people doing improv stuff. That's not fuck
5736080	5742080	the audience. That's the opposite. We, we, we have thank you. These two people, we have, yeah,
5742080	5746320	exactly. 30 people showed up here. It doesn't matter if there's not 30,000. Right. Fuck,
5746320	5750560	fuck the lack of audience. No, we, we play for the front row and we play for the back row,
5750560	5755360	even if they're not there and that show business. Fuck. I saw the B-52s played a thing and there
5755360	5760560	was only 70 people there and they just, like they hated the audience because there weren't enough of
5760560	5765600	them. Like you, you still got paid. They might have, they might have hate in their hearts for
5765600	5771600	the venue or something that, that, that open Mike Eagle. Can I call you open? You can call me
5771600	5779680	whatever you ask. Like, like, so raised by these grandparents who were, let's call them solipsists.
5779680	5784320	Like, like we don't know that, like they were like, keep your nose to the grindstone. Stay good,
5784320	5789360	stay out of trouble. Don't, why be like these people outside the front door who are like
5789360	5795520	causing trouble, reacting to trouble, all this shit. You stay the course. Then you come to this
5795520	5805120	plot point. Oh, I could rap though. So you're messaging. You're like, are you like, are you
5805120	5810880	selfish or are you altruistic? How do you view yourself philosophically? I'm very selfish
5810880	5819520	because my whole aesthetic is, is about the value of my own art because it's like that shit I was
5819520	5826960	saying. Like when I first encountered hip hop and there, the, the aesthetic value was on everybody
5826960	5833840	pretending to be the hardest, right? And to me, that so devalues the individual experience of
5833840	5839280	seeing somebody else could be living right in that same community with them. But suddenly if I'm not
5839280	5844080	hard, then my experience is somehow less authentic than the next person's. And my whole
5844080	5848320	shit is railing against that. So I write about whatever stupid shit I want to write about.
5848320	5854320	That's what I thought I heard there was like fences put up, but in a healthy way or laser turrets
5854320	5860480	where you're like, that's fucking like, fuck you. You sound like me in therapy. You're like,
5860480	5863920	there's a health to that. That's interesting. I'm glad you said that. I don't know.
5863920	5868560	Because to me, I mean, to me, it's for the, it's for the overall health of like,
5868560	5874560	especially the black community, because that's a toxic to understand that they can feel how they
5874560	5881200	feel. I was just doing, I was doing Archie bunker going, that could be an individual for Christ's
5881200	5889440	sake. That that's what, that's what cultural like movements lack for all that they provide. They,
5889440	5895600	they take, they draw from the bank of individuality. And when we talk about white privilege,
5895600	5899360	one of the, why am I explaining this to you? I'm explaining this to myself. I'm explaining this to
5899360	5903360	myself. When we talk about white privilege, one of the biggest privileges is the privilege to be
5903360	5908480	like, I'm a little bit of this and I'm a little bit of that. Here comes a beat. Cause I'm talking
5908480	5915760	like a hat. I got a hat on my head. No, I'm kidding. Don't God damn it. Don't do it. Uh, no,
5915760	5920400	but, but, but that, that's very like that solipsism. That's like, that, that like, uh,
5920400	5924480	like I only care about myself, but there's a difference between that and like malignant,
5924480	5930800	like fuck you. I'm only out to get what's mine. That's different. Cause it's, it's not agreed.
5930800	5935600	It's like, it's, it's like, it's from a humanist. It's like, who am I? That's all I can possibly
5935600	5941200	know. And it's like every human's experience is valid and valuable starting with mine,
5941200	5945680	but not to shit on anybody else's, but this is my time at the podium and I'm going to do my shit.
5945680	5949920	You know what I mean? Yes. I do know what you mean. Like, like my therapist is bummed out about it.
5949920	5955520	Cause because, because she, I, you, because she would say you are closed to Mike Eagle.
5955520	5962720	Sure. Uh, and then her job is to open you and I thought like, like that's what I'm encountering
5962720	5967680	is like, cause I have all these like mechanisms. Like I can, I'm going to, I can, I can detect
5967680	5972080	anyone that's going to tell me what to do from 600 meters and their head will explode before
5972080	5977440	they knew what happened to them. Um, and, and, and now I have to understand that that's not
5977440	5982880	keeping me alive anymore. That's actually going to kill me. Is it? Yeah. Well, I'm not a therapist.
5982880	5989520	No, no, I'm just, I was gonna challenge that, but then you're talking about a professional who's
5989520	5992960	helping you. So I probably shouldn't do that. And she's pretty good. And the, and the more I
5992960	5996560	listen to her, the happier I get. Well, that's great. Like, like, like, like, but, but like,
5996560	5998720	and it wouldn't be, it wouldn't be the same advice for you. What was your challenge,
5998800	6005040	Mike? What were you going to say? Well, I mean, is that what's going to kill you if it's also like,
6006240	6011840	what powers you, what makes you vital? Like, you know, like what is, is, and right now we're having
6011840	6015520	all these arguments. I mean, this is a, this is a, this is a person who like says like, Oh,
6015520	6019200	don't go on Facebook and Twitter. That's secondhand smoke. And then Trump got elected and she was like,
6019200	6023680	whoops. Not, not that being on Twitter and Facebook would have stopped him from getting
6023680	6028480	elected. But at the same time I was like, come on, man. Like we're like, like, this is different
6028480	6032480	from dangling chads and like riling yourself up before you go to work in the normal world.
6033040	6039120	I'm often a tangent, but like I have like debates with her about the difference between defense
6039120	6043680	mechanisms that are making you happy. One of the things that she said to me most recently that I
6043680	6052720	thought was really interesting, um, was this idea that like your brain with all its fucking
6052720	6059920	fucked up chemistry, it's like, imagine all these like cars whizzing around and you can focus on
6059920	6065600	any one at any time and they all intersect. So like, you might be having a day when you're like,
6065600	6070320	fuck the system and you might be having a day when you're like, my back hurts or, um, I'm,
6070320	6076800	I'm afraid of death or like all of these and I love babies and I miss my dog and I like the
6076800	6081520	color blue and, uh, I'm not starting to rap. You don't have to give me a beat. Um, the, the,
6082160	6089360	we folk, you, you, you fixate when you fixate, like when you're, so like if a leopard was chasing you,
6090000	6096640	the car you'd follow mixing metaphors would be, I gotta fucking get out of here. And that's a
6096640	6102160	healthy version of fixation where you're like, why would you want to talk about Stanley Kubrick's
6102160	6107440	movies while you're running from a leopard? It's going to kill you. So we have a tendency
6107440	6114240	as the chimpanzees that we are, that we evolved from, we, uh, we very easily fixate on danger
6114240	6118720	things. And when you're in a conversation with somebody, when you're in a, in a thing that's
6118720	6125600	challenging you, like, like she's like, look ahead. I'm not asking you to not fixate on shit. I'm
6125600	6132000	asking you to fixate even more and look all the way ahead to where that car is going.
6132320	6136000	Is it headed toward a brick wall? Is it headed toward another call? Like, like, like, like,
6136000	6141680	do you, like, do you want to blow up or do you want to be friends, get through this alive,
6141680	6147120	be a good boyfriend, like get another drink, uh, like end your show well, like, like, or do you
6147120	6151280	want to, like, do you want to follow the car that's going to explode? I didn't, it was like,
6151280	6155280	I'm probably just servicing your metaphor, but, but that's my new thing as I'm like, even with
6155280	6159920	for quite a while now, right? The same therapist. Yeah. Yeah. But did you find her because you
6160000	6167040	have an ability to, like your, to reform my neurology. Exactly. Like, do you, do you find
6167040	6173360	her a, uh, do you find her appear like intellectually, like you can listen to her and like, and dig what
6173360	6178240	you're saying or, or like, or do you instantly want to shut her down? Like, because you have the
6178240	6186320	ability to turn things into mythology and. No, I find her to be somebody who's like super duper
6186320	6191520	smart about shit that I have not had time to study or think about, which is specifically
6191520	6195920	neurology, the way the brain works. Like she doesn't care. She never, she doesn't go like,
6196480	6200480	you should stop drinking. You should be a better, you know, she's like, how are you
6201280	6205920	fucking up? Like, how are you like keeping yourself from being happy? That's too punitive
6205920	6212000	too. She's just more like, like, oh, uh, here's how brains work. Here's how you could be a superhuman
6212000	6218000	kind of like, I don't know. So how often do you go once a week? At least.
6220400	6225600	You know, someone going to, do you go together with Cody or is it single? That makes me,
6225600	6230960	now I'm going to go to her once every two weeks because I still have to work on that aspect of
6230960	6238720	myself. I don't like approval. It makes me suspicious. You love approval. Not from those people.
6239120	6246400	You know what they are? They're a grid of white squares. Hit it.
6250160	6256080	Are there any, but, but like in that solipsism, because I made you, you, you were candid with me.
6256080	6260320	You said that, which kind of amazed me. I didn't expect to hear that answer from you, but I, I was
6260320	6266960	like, so like, but you want everybody else to be happy, right? Yeah. No, I would love for everybody
6267040	6271760	to be happy. And so, and, and, and, and, and, and, and you and I both believe that if everybody
6271760	6276480	kind of focused on like knew who they were and knew when they were lying and not lying, like that,
6276480	6284320	that would be the beginning of like the solution. What do you, how much of your lyrics are about
6284320	6291360	that? Like, are you talking to, to the audience? Are you talking to yourself? Are you, like,
6291360	6295280	are you getting your own stuff off your chest? Or are you, are you trying to, you know,
6295280	6299760	I don't talk about like my, my deepest therapy shit. Like I don't talk about that type of shit,
6299760	6307920	but I just, I tend to honor whatever creative whim I'm in in a moment. And that mostly tends
6307920	6313280	to be about some conversation I'm having inside of myself. Now that could be about the world,
6313840	6318160	or it could be about what the fuck it's like right now on the stage. You know what I mean?
6318160	6322880	But if I'm sitting with a beat and I want to write to it, my whole thing is whatever
6323760	6328320	nugget or seed that I get, I'm just going to follow that to wherever the fuck it goes.
6328880	6331600	Right. All right. Well, let's do it.
6334160	6337920	Wait. Oh shit. We're going to, we're going to demonstrate our new skills and our therapy
6337920	6342560	and everything. Oh, by the way, Spencer, real quick. Uh, we're going to, I'm going to roll,
6344880	6351040	I'm going to roll dice on my new, uh, gnome on my gnome, uh, Druid character this week. And so we're
6351040	6355680	going to start that shit next time. Now I heard tell it wasn't going to be a gnome druid. Are you,
6355680	6360720	are you reneging on that? Is it going to be a gnome druid again? It was originally an elf druid,
6360720	6366080	but I, I saw your drawing that was a gnome. So I'm going to go gnome druid. All right.
6367280	6371280	What do you think? Should it, should it not be a gnome druid? Say again.
6372400	6378240	Didn't we agree that it was going to be a gnome druid? Say again. Didn't we agree that it was
6378240	6382880	going to be a gnome druid? Yeah. And then you texted me on Saturday that you didn't want to
6382880	6387840	do it anymore. Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far, far, far away. You know,
6387840	6393920	druids can turn into birds. I'm going to be a gnome druid. I chickened out, but I'm going to,
6393920	6401280	I'm going to commit. Is a gnome druid okay? Yeah. No, it's great. You seem bummed out about it.
6401280	6406800	I think Dan's bummed out about it. Dan doesn't see our heroes right now. Yeah. He's just ripped
6406800	6412960	on Adderall. That's a good point. I'll be so focused. I'm going to roll, I'm going to roll
6412960	6418960	my stats and bother you for a week and a half about my, my new character. Yeah, it'll be great.
6420640	6422240	But I think you should close it for sure.
6428080	6430080	Close your eyes.
6437360	6438240	Close your eyes.
6445040	6445920	Oh, wait a minute. Okay.
6448800	6455920	Keep closing your eyes. Only now I command it as your dark lord.
6455920	6457760	A gnome druid is okay, right? Yeah.
6457760	6458800	A gnome druid is good.
6463440	6465600	I am the dark lord of darkness.
6469280	6470160	Seems redundant.
6472480	6473760	People call me redundant.
6476240	6477200	I'm not a pundit.
6479440	6483120	I'm going to, I'm going to run it down. I'm going to
6483120	6493520	throw a feather down with a pillow. Round. Yo. No, not yo. Yo is a crutch. Yo. Here we go.
6494720	6504240	My name is Morpheus. I'm going to Adorpheus. Don't think. Just rap. Just flow. Just go.
6504240	6508960	Just put your head on your toe. The flow stage. When your head's on your toe,
6508960	6512400	you're going to go to your soul and go down to the buffalo.
6514000	6518560	A buffalo is extinct, but your mama's pussy's so deep that it's like a sink,
6518560	6525840	but that's not an issue. I need a tissue. I'm going to cry. Because I miss you.
6527360	6534720	Because you're my baby. I'm Valentine. I said, maybe I gave you earrings. I gave you a ring.
6534720	6537760	I gave your mama's pussy so much it started to sing.
6538720	6543840	Your mama's pussy has a larynx in it. I'm your mother's pussy.
6546720	6553280	It sings out loud. It sings higher than a cloud. I'm deep like a sink like she sings.
6555440	6557280	Your mama's pussy.
6557280	6566080	I'm your mother's pussy. That hasn't changed. Your mama's pussy.
6568720	6576400	I'm a singing vagina. There's three holes. Let's list them.
6581200	6587040	Hole one. Hole one. Hole one's where the fun begun. It's 6,000 BC.
6587040	6593440	It's where the hole comes from the pee pee. Every woman needs to urinate, but that's where
6593440	6599280	the world started to get created when the pee stream comes out of hole number one.
6600400	6605920	That's hole number one. Hole number one. Hole number two.
6607920	6613840	There's two more. Hole number two. That's for doo doo. It's called a butt when you poop through.
6613840	6620240	What your colon's gonna do. You make the poop with the food and you eat it when you poop it out
6620240	6624320	when you're in the mood. Hole three.
6633360	6638400	Hole three. A pieziotomy. It's the birth canal, you see. It's where the babies come out.
6639040	6643200	I don't even have a protein. Okay, we don't have to. All right.
6646560	6646880	Yeah.
6650560	6658560	Hole three. I'll throw anything at you. Please do. Golf ball. Golf ball? Uh, I'm off y'all. I can't do
6658560	6665040	nothing. I need to press the move button. It's like the move house in Philadelphia. Somebody,
6665040	6669840	I'm asking you to help me. That's what I'm do. I'm over the top of the water just like
6669840	6675440	help me or kale. Does it matter? I can fail. I can struggle. I can sail. I can do all of that
6675440	6680960	across anybody. The water. I can body slam you like I'm a sergeant slaughter and the GI Joe,
6680960	6686080	but he was the hero villain. Does it matter? He was chilling in his little A-shirt. Y'all can't
6686080	6691920	make me hurt. That's what I say. And that's what I do. I slide through up like Link when he's fucking
6691920	6697680	capturing or rescuing Zelda from Hyrule in high school. I played that shit and that's what I do.
6697680	6702080	But no, but I already said that. So now I repeat, gotta throw me more things. I don't know what the
6702080	6715840	fuck. Hip hop. That beat was too short. Is that it? I think that's it. All right. Do, well, do, do
6715840	6719760	what? Close our show with one of your fucking awesome. What do you, are you willing, can I just
6719760	6723440	order that like a pizza? You want to do one? Just do your thing. There's nothing I would,
6723440	6728320	I'd rather do more. All right. I'm gonna do this, this song. I just wrote a couple of weeks ago
6728320	6737760	about how I don't want people to invite me to their weddings. Okay. So don't invite me to your wedding.
6737760	6749120	You didn't invite me to your funeral. So I'm not gonna be on time. You didn't invite me to your
6749120	6760640	funeral. So don't invite me to your wedding. You didn't invite me to your funeral. So I'm not gonna
6760640	6769120	be on time. Yeah. Yeah. No bad flips and no somersaults and I'm gonna toss every invite that
6769120	6773760	I come across. Then I'm gonna fight this shit like an underboss. Yeah. Yeah. Some guilt there,
6773760	6779920	but it won't grow. Heartbroken. I don't know. You can ask me if I'm gon' go, but a recommend that
6779920	6785200	you don't know. And I don't care who gon' be there. You can save that shit for a single man. I'm gonna
6785200	6791920	sit here in my studio. Elbows deep in a Pringles can. Yeah. Instincts say run, run from you. My brain's
6791920	6798160	so uncomfortable. Everything's so combustible. I don't even know one hush to pull. I'm not going
6798160	6803200	front, front for you. No subterfuge. Why can't you like bum bum and shoot? And I'm trying to write a
6803200	6809680	dumb something new. Yeah. Yeah. This must be some kind of joke. Saw that big dumb envelope. Might've
6809680	6815600	looked like maybe I was down. I had my foot on the ropes. Yeah. I was blinking and thought I was
6815600	6820480	down now. Thanks again. When you brought it up, I was blinking and thought I was down now. Thanks
6820480	6826880	again. Yeah. Got a limited time on earth. So what's your side show worth? I'll watch your slideshow
6826880	6832880	first. Yeah. I'm focused. I'm Joe dirty. Yeah. Yeah. After all, let's play some tag or basketball.
6832880	6837040	If it's college shirts or slacks involved, y'all can keep the dress cold. That's for y'all. You
6837040	6841920	ain't go to mind. I know you then ain't known you long. Ain't no new friends. Yeah. We all get it.
6841920	6847200	You go with him and you go with her. So let's most of her, but let's order chicken and baked potato.
6847200	6852160	Most of we just play some halo. Please. Oh, please don't make me fake bro. I say all this because I
6852160	6861200	hate to say no, hate to say no, hate to say no. Don't invite me to your wedding. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

6897760	6905520	put on an open mic. Eagle beat. Play one of your beats out. Oh, the stool went down. Power move.
6905520	6912000	It was a display of power. Uh, yeah, we're going to be back at meltdown next week and, uh, but,
6912000	6917440	and we'll keep testing this facility and like, whatever. I love it. Let's hear it for open mic
