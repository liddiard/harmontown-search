0	8000	From Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, it's great to be back. You guys missed a doozy up at the outside lands of San Francisco.
8000	11000	Harmontown, once again, is now in session.
15000	20000	Dave Kline, go to the mic and give us a good yoop to start us off. Just give me one good yoop.
21000	23000	One yoop.
24000	29000	Alright, sit down. Spencer Creddon and everybody, Spencer!
35000	42000	Yoop. Let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, fresh from the ladies room, Mr. Dan Harmon.
46000	49000	Thank you. Thank you very much.
50000	55000	I thought the punchline was going to be, it doesn't ring a bell. His face doesn't ring a bell.
55000	57000	I didn't hear it. I know there was a guy...
57000	60000	It was a good joke. It was the dead ringer? Was that it?
60000	64000	Oh yeah, classic. Classic joke.
64000	68000	You didn't have to fill in for me. I was ready to...
68000	73000	I was told to stretch. I panicked. I really tossed that out early.
74000	78000	Alright, well, let's see.
78000	79000	Uh oh.
79000	82000	So we saw a radiohead at outside lands.
82000	83000	We did.
83000	97000	And I realized the name of their band is kind of actually, even though they're not at all the genre,
97000	104000	that the name of their band actually sounds like the name of a song from an 80s heavy metal band.
104000	108000	And I kept... I was getting really high and I was singing...
108000	115000	I have this song I made up in my head that goes a little something like this.
117000	121000	I didn't want to present it as like, oh, it's a real song, but I guess I did.
121000	124000	But I just started doing it a lot.
124000	125000	Can we hear it?
125000	126000	Can we hear a little bit?
126000	128000	Let me just try a little acapella here.
128000	132000	Turn your station to misery.
134000	136000	Watch your dial.
136000	138000	I don't know. It's a placeholder in the lyrics.
138000	141000	What's your favorite frequency?
141000	146000	I've got a radiohead. A radiohead.
146000	151000	Radio soul. Radio rock. Radio roll.
151000	154000	I've got a radiohead.
160000	171000	A thousand watts of deviled power beaming in your soul and tenors in your satan dick.
174000	179000	To transmitting rock and roll. I've got a radiohead.
180000	185000	Can we get the person that made the Rob Schwab...
185000	190000	It gets worse song to put that to a beat and give me some heavy guitar on that one?
190000	193000	It was better when I was high and then I get up here and I'm nervous.
193000	194000	It was fucking great.
194000	195000	Thanks.
195000	199000	You were high in San Francisco on stage yesterday and you were beyond delightful.
199000	201000	You hit a beautiful sweet spot.
201000	208000	Then we got into a limo getting back from the airport today and Dan started just yelling at his laptop.
209000	212000	We didn't know what was going on but you lost a jet pack in Minecraft.
212000	213000	Yeah.
215000	229000	I went to the nether with my jet pack because I wanted to get a broken spawner so that I could make a powered spawner with enderman in it so I could harvest ender pearls and ratchet up my game a little bit.
230000	239000	I started burrowing through a wall of netherrack and it was just blithely cockily like shimmy in along.
239000	243000	Then I got buried in lava and I lost my jet pack.
244000	249000	Then I went back to my base and I tried to make another jet pack.
249000	252000	I need appliances to do that.
252000	262000	I forgot that I was using a tier one industrial craft metal former with it hooked up to a CESU which is a tier two power source.
262000	264000	The metal former blew up.
264000	265000	Dan, don't talk down to us.
269000	273000	So the CESU was a tier two power transformer then?
273000	274000	Yeah.
274000	277000	I forgot to put a transformer upgrade into the metal former.
278000	281000	How many metal formers exploded before you figured that out?
281000	283000	About three or four.
283000	284000	Jesus.
284000	287000	And that is a lot of iron if I'm not mistaken.
287000	289000	That's okay because I have that iron exploit.
289000	291000	Right, of course.
291000	292000	That's been our show.
292000	294000	Thanks for coming everybody.
296000	297000	All right.
297000	298000	Well, okay.
298000	301000	So if that doesn't amaze you, this will.
303000	306000	Well, don't assume we weren't amazed by that.
306000	312000	I kind of did something wrong while I was grabbing my laptop on the plane and I cracked my thumbnail a little bit.
312000	317000	It's just a little chippy thing where it was like wherever you put your hand it's going to get snagged.
317000	318000	That kind of thing.
318000	320000	Nothing that big a deal but it had to be taken care of.
320000	325000	So while we were waiting for you because we had that whole double shuttle thing happening and we were waiting by the door.
325000	327000	It's like, well, I have fingernail clippers.
327000	328000	It's maybe a little gross.
328000	329000	It's LAX.
329000	330000	Who cares?
330000	332000	I'll go over to the garbage can.
332000	334000	I'll be very discreet and I'll just clip a little bit.
334000	338000	Some people are very, you know, I'm aware that, you know, there's different people have different triggers.
338000	345000	You know, it's like, like, like, like for some people the sight or sound of somebody clipping their fingernails is fucking like awful disgusting for them.
345000	348000	Like, like other people's teeth scraping on a fork.
348000	349000	You don't know.
349000	353000	So I went, I went, I went over to a garbage can away from everybody else.
353000	356000	And I, I just very discreetly was like, it's just going to be one thumbnail.
356000	359000	And I, and I, I clipped and it went shooting like a rocket.
360000	362000	Just missed someone's head like that was sitting.
362000	364000	And I just like ignored it.
368000	369000	I'm amazed.
369000	372000	What if I had pelted somebody with a fingernail?
372000	373000	That would be a bummer.
373000	374000	That would be insane.
374000	376000	Like, what do you, how do you even get out of that?
376000	377000	How do you even, what do you even say?
377000	380000	Did you enjoy your Radiohead experience yesterday?
380000	381000	Yeah, it was good.
381000	386000	I was, I just ate a lot of funnel cake and like peanut butter and chocolate and got a real bad heartburn.
386000	387000	But outside lands was fun.
387000	388000	We were walking around it.
388000	390000	I mean, I didn't like watch Radiohead or anything.
390000	391000	You could hear him playing it anyway.
391000	395000	And it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, they're going to be better live.
395000	396000	It's Radiohead.
396000	399000	They're not, they're not, they're not, they're not acoustic head.
399000	404000	They're not, they're not, they're not, they're not, they're not the Pixies.
404000	406000	They fucking, they have radios for heads.
406000	407000	They're like, they're.
407000	410000	As I understand it, they radio rock and radio roll.
412000	414000	The devil wants your station.
415000	418000	Broadcasting all night long.
419000	422000	My black heart's got a woofer tweeter.
423000	425000	Broadcast my song.
425000	427000	I'm a Radiohead.
427000	430000	Was this song sung by Starscream from the Decepticons?
433000	440000	On the way out to San Francisco, you know, you go up to the kiosk right before the X-ray machines.
440000	444000	And everybody's using the QR code things now.
444000	447000	And I go boop, and it doesn't work.
447000	448000	Everybody else goes through.
448000	450000	The guy's like, it's real cranky.
450000	452000	And he goes, he goes, it's not working.
452000	453000	It's not reading your thing.
453000	457000	And I'm like, well, boop, you know, it's not, it's not working.
457000	460000	And then the guy's like, well, do you have a paper ticket?
460000	461000	And I said, no.
461000	463000	And he's like, well, that's weird.
464000	465000	What?
465000	466000	Yeah, that's so weird.
466000	472000	So weird to not because when we made the decision to maybe cut down a few less trees by putting,
472000	477000	by using fucking coal electric plants to, like, get on the plane instead.
477000	481000	Like, you know, like, oh, yeah, it would be weird to not do both.
481000	484000	It would be weird to not, like, cut down a tree, turn that into a ticket,
484000	488000	and then also have, like, a power plant chug into your phone and then also use that.
488000	490000	Yeah, real weird.
490000	491000	Fucking dick.
491000	495000	Why don't you just, how about, how about you stick to what's ISIS and what's not ISIS?
495000	500000	And I'll, I'll tell you what's weird, you fucking fake cop.
501000	504000	Fucking weird, weird, weird, fake cop with a baggy ass uniform.
504000	507000	They're always all baggy and dirty.
507000	510000	Look like they're wearing cop pajamas.
510000	514000	Fucking misshapen, fucking cop rejects, fucking critches.
514000	522000	Every, every, every single one of them just either, either at the bottom of their life or walking a razor thin line between fucking like...
522000	525000	You're never going on TSA Pre again, my friends.
526000	529000	Oh, yeah, TSA Pre, sure.
529000	533000	Let's, let's, let's get that vampire in our kitchen, sure.
534000	536000	Does anybody here have TSA Pre?
536000	538000	Does anybody subject themselves to that?
538000	540000	I always wonder about that.
540000	542000	It's supposed to be great.
542000	543000	You said it's supposed to be great.
543000	545000	Is that what you said?
545000	550000	Yeah, I know it looks great and they make it look great because they have a whole lane that they're not using and they...
550000	551000	It's not convenient.
551000	552000	What's that?
552000	553000	It's not convenient.
553000	555000	Ask for a wheelchair.
555000	557000	Ask for a wheelchair?
557000	559000	You could smuggle drugs if you got a wheelchair.
559000	566000	Just get an international bill, travel number, and then you don't have to get your laptop, your pre-check, your everything.
566000	571000	I find the best way to get through security fast is be Seth Rogen.
573000	578000	I think I've told on the show before where I broke my toe and I had a cane and I got right through everything.
578000	581000	I just had a cane, I just had a broken pinky toe.
582000	591000	I was behind a Iraq veteran who had been blown up below the knee on both legs.
591000	594000	I was like, I just have a little boo-boo.
594000	596000	And yet they walk you right through.
600000	603000	So you guys know what hyperplexia is?
603000	604000	Oh yeah.
605000	609000	My girlfriend had a friend at the show.
609000	621000	One of her gigs is teaching autistic kids and she's talking about hyperplexia, which is like the opposite of dyslexia, I guess.
621000	628000	It's where you can read really fast, especially in little kids in childhood that read really fast, but you have low comprehension.
628000	630000	You don't actually know what you're reading.
631000	635000	I was like, oh yeah, I can read really well, but I have to read.
635000	642000	If I didn't know you weren't supposed to move your lips when you read, I would absolutely move my lips because that's only how fast I can understand anything,
642000	643000	because I have to hear it in my head.
643000	647000	But I could read like a page and just not have any retention.
647000	649000	I wonder if I'm hyperplexic.
649000	650000	Wouldn't that be cool?
650000	652000	That would be amazing.
652000	654000	Wouldn't that be cool, Jeff?
654000	656000	If I was hyperplexic?
656000	657000	So cool.
658000	661000	You'd be like the fawns of reading.
665000	669000	Yeah, because he loved rock and roll, but he'd hit the jukebox and it would just play or stop playing.
669000	670000	I was like, he's too good.
670000	672000	He called the toilet his office.
672000	673000	He doesn't fucking know.
673000	674000	What a cool guy.
674000	675000	What a cool guy.
676000	677000	Called the toilet his office.
677000	682000	He was 55 and hung out with teenagers who were 38.
682000	686000	He was a 55-year-old Jewish guy who hung out with teenagers.
686000	692000	He was 4'3", just lived in your attic and told everyone to sit on it all the time.
693000	694000	Sit on what?
694000	695000	It.
696000	697000	Sit on his dick?
697000	699000	Do you think that's what sit on it meant?
699000	701000	Sit on my dick?
702000	704000	It's rape culture, man.
705000	706000	It's fucked up.
706000	710000	The 50s were fucked up in the 70s.
710000	711000	The 70s.
713000	715000	Gary Marshall just passed away.
715000	716000	Why are we laughing?
716000	717000	Stop it.
718000	720000	Way to go, you fucking ghouls.
722000	726000	I'm sure 75% of the people have never seen an episode of Happy Days in their life.
726000	727000	Yeah, but everybody knows about it.
727000	730000	And that goes to Gary Marshall's efficacy.
730000	733000	He did more community, Laverne and Shirley.
733000	735000	When do you think Happy Days jumped the shark?
741000	745000	I'll say it was two seasons before the shark episode.
750000	751000	That's when they brought Mark on.
751000	752000	When Mark was there.
752000	754000	I met the guy that coined that phrase.
754000	756000	He's on Stern, right?
756000	758000	One of the Stern network shows or something?
758000	760000	Yeah, that's what it says.
760000	761000	Okay, grandpa.
762000	764000	Alright, well seriously, that's it.
764000	765000	That's all I got.
765000	766000	That's all the show we had?
766000	769000	Well, we gave him a lot in San Francisco and then we turned out we weren't recording.
770000	772000	That's what happened.
772000	776000	I did a whole thing where I did a Michael Winslow meets Radiohead thing.
778000	780000	I mean, do it again.
780000	782000	I tried to do so much again already.
782000	783000	I mean, yeah.
783000	784000	It was like...
786000	787000	Here's my...
788000	791000	You did a concert full of can-openers.
791000	795000	Electric can-openers went to a concert where Radiohead was playing.
795000	797000	Well, I'm going to tweak it.
797000	800000	I'm going to change it now that we get to do it again.
800000	806000	But there was a helicopter and Michael Winslow was flying the helicopter while having a leaf blower going.
807000	809000	I'm going to tweak it so you don't have to recap it.
809000	810000	Morgan Freeman showed up at some point.
810000	816000	So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say Michael Winslow is getting into a helicopter made of can-openers.
817000	818000	Okay.
818000	819000	Okay.
819000	822000	So he has to start each electric can-opener to make the helicopter get going.
822000	826000	And then he's going to use a leaf blower to attack Radiohead.
826000	827000	Why?
827000	828000	Okay.
828000	829000	Why?
829000	830000	Jesus.
830000	832000	Does somebody actually say why?
832000	833000	Yeah.
833000	834000	I mean, he just blurted it out.
834000	835000	Like, it's like, why?
835000	836000	Well...
836000	837000	Like, I almost forgive him.
837000	838000	Like, it wasn't...
838000	839000	He didn't even think about it.
839000	840000	He's that...
840000	842000	I have to forgive it because that's immersion.
842000	843000	Like, he's immersed.
843000	844000	How high are the stakes?
844000	845000	Yeah.
845000	846000	He's like, why?
846000	847000	Why?
847000	848000	Why?
848000	850000	Oh, I actually know the answer, sir, because Morgan Freeman shows up.
850000	852000	That's why he's doing it.
852000	854000	No, you're just confusing people.
854000	857000	You don't have to recreate the dumb...
857000	858000	Okay.
858000	860000	Walk us through what you're going to do now.
860000	861000	Okay.
861000	862000	So Michael Winslow is...
862000	866000	Either take your shirt off or don't take your shirt off.
866000	869000	You can't just half-take off a shirt.
873000	876000	Dan forgot he was taking his shirt off halfway through.
876000	878000	I was just going to leave it there.
878000	879000	I had more to say.
879000	880000	I can't talk.
880000	883000	Have a weird halter top on for the rest of the show.
884000	885000	Just the good old boys.
885000	886000	Just start washing everybody's car, yeah.
886000	890000	Just bringing hot wings to your seats.
890000	894000	Michael Winslow is getting in his helicopter made of electric can openers.
894000	895000	Okay.
895000	908000	And to answer your question, sir, the answer is because Radiohead and Michael Winslow both
908000	913000	operate in the field of phonics sound.
913000	920000	And Radiohead, Michael Winslow, mistakenly feels is abusing sound because they're using
920000	923000	electronics and things to...
923000	924000	He's more analog.
924000	925000	They're more digital.
925000	927000	He's more analog and it feels that sound...
927000	931000	Both of them are locked in a flawed dichotomy.
931000	936000	What happens is they learn to overcome their differences because there's a third, like,
936000	940000	truly evil force that they have to unite.
940000	941000	But no spoilers.
941000	942000	Okay.
942000	943000	But this is like...
943000	950000	We find Michael Winslow going to his helicopter pad at Michael Winslow Manor.
950000	953000	That's just...
953000	954000	He makes that sound.
954000	955000	He's like...
955000	956000	And then he goes up.
956000	966000	I want to get on my helicopter made of can openers.
967000	968000	No, wait.
968000	969000	Hold on.
969000	970000	Shit.
970000	978000	Dan, we don't have to do this.
978000	981000	If you're not ready.
981000	983000	This is called refusal of a call.
983000	985000	The refusal of a call.
1014000	1015000	Just all I know of you.
1023000	1027000	Everything, everything, is it as right?
1031000	1032000	What the fuck
1035000	1037000	So the leaf blooored.
1039000	1041000	In the wrong place.
1042000	1043000	Everything.
1045000	1046000	Everything.
1058000	1061000	Everything is in its right place.
1061000	1063000	Let's get back to things.
1063000	1066000	Hey, whatever the lead singer of Radiohead's name is.
1067000	1069000	It's me, your right hand man.
1069000	1071000	Whatever my name is, the bass player.
1072000	1073000	If we have a bass.
1078000	1079000	What is it, Tyler?
1084000	1088000	Shouldn't we go check to make sure Michael Winslow is truly taken out?
1089000	1090000	You saw the explosion.
1093000	1096000	That one wasn't a mouth noise one.
1097000	1100000	Hubris, everything.
1101000	1104000	In its right place.
1105000	1106000	In its right place.
1112000	1113000	Oh shit.
1117000	1118000	Leg wound.
1121000	1122000	Twig.
1124000	1125000	Stab.
1127000	1129000	Second twig.
1130000	1131000	Stab.
1132000	1134000	Pocket microphone.
1135000	1137000	Tiny jam box speaker.
1142000	1147000	Ad hoc strange phonic based first aid technique.
1149000	1152000	In which the two twigs pick up like a dowsing rod.
1153000	1155000	The sound of my healing.
1156000	1157000	But it's not going to feel good.
1165000	1167000	There, stop the bleeding.
1170000	1171000	Everything.
1172000	1174000	In its right place.
1174000	1176000	Thank you everybody for Radiohead.
1176000	1177000	Alright, good night.
1177000	1179000	Man, Tyler, that was great.
1180000	1182000	Let's go back to the dressing room.
1182000	1183000	Yeah, come on, man.
1183000	1185000	We fucking Radioheaded those motherfuckers.
1187000	1188000	Oh shit.
1191000	1193000	Michael Winslow.
1197000	1198000	Take it easy, man.
1199000	1200000	Just take it easy.
1201000	1202000	No.
1202000	1203000	No.
1207000	1210000	I think there's been a big misunderstanding.
1211000	1217000	And if we all just remember that we both enjoy the nuances of sound.
1218000	1219000	Two knives.
1224000	1227000	Shit, he made the sound of them bouncing off his head so they did.
1233000	1236000	Just beat him up silently.
1237000	1239000	I said silently, Steve.
1239000	1240000	Sorry.
1243000	1245000	What the fuck?
1250000	1252000	Everybody, go outside under the deck.
1253000	1255000	Look, it's a giant thing.
1256000	1257000	I'm so exhausted.
1257000	1258000	I'm not going to make anything up.
1260000	1261000	It's a giant thing.
1263000	1265000	Work together.
1273000	1274000	Yeah.
1275000	1277000	See you next summer.
1278000	1279000	Wait.
1280000	1283000	The third act had, the third acted.
1284000	1287000	It kind of rushed towards the end there.
1287000	1296000	So Radiohead and Michael Winslow learned to work together to defeat the giant thing by making fart sounds out of them.
1297000	1298000	Yeah, they farted on it.
1298000	1299000	I like that.
1299000	1301000	I didn't know that Radiohead was run by Steve and Tyler.
1302000	1304000	They were Steve and Tyler.
1306000	1307000	Yep, yep, yep.
1307000	1311000	There are two keyboards in here.
1312000	1315000	There's a song I want to play.
1316000	1321000	There's a song I want to play.
1322000	1330000	Everything in its right place.
1331000	1332000	Radiohead.
1333000	1335000	I like, no, please.
1336000	1337000	Okay.
1339000	1344000	But what would it be like if Radiohead worked at your local produce section?
1345000	1347000	I think it would go a little something.
1348000	1352000	Yesterday I found someone stuck in this limon.
1353000	1354000	Okay.
1356000	1359000	I just remembered there's some produce in their lyrics and I got excited.
1361000	1362000	Okay, all right.
1362000	1363000	All right.
1363000	1364000	There's still no show.
1364000	1365000	That was a brief distraction.
1365000	1367000	I thought we had guests tonight.
1367000	1368000	We don't have guests.
1368000	1371000	No, we were going to have some guests and then they canceled.
1371000	1372000	What?
1372000	1373000	What?
1373000	1374000	Yeah.
1374000	1376000	You mean Steve and Tyler couldn't make it tonight?
1377000	1378000	Morgan Freeman?
1378000	1379000	Morgan Freeman.
1379000	1380000	He'd be great.
1381000	1382000	What happened to them?
1382000	1383000	Should we talk about it?
1383000	1387000	Well, the bad news is they canceled, but the good news is it was Andy Dick.
1387000	1398000	So, yeah, we dodged our own bullet out of our own gun.
1399000	1401000	Yeah, it was Tino and Andy.
1401000	1405000	Tino and Andy have a new podcast together, which sounds like a bad idea.
1406000	1407000	Probably is.
1407000	1408000	And they were going to join us.
1408000	1409000	Yeah.
1409000	1410000	I'm sad.
1410000	1411000	What was their excuse tonight?
1411000	1416000	Well, I mean, the same thing that makes them fun to be around probably just makes it hard
1416000	1417000	for them to schedule.
1417000	1420000	I mean, they're kind of an unpredictable combo.
1420000	1421000	Andy's sober now.
1421000	1423000	He's been on the wagon for quite a while.
1423000	1427000	Yeah, he's been on the wagon many, many, many times.
1428000	1430000	He's getting very good at being on the wagon.
1430000	1431000	Yeah, I don't know.
1431000	1432000	I'm not going to.
1434000	1437000	We will talk to him about that when he comes, you know?
1437000	1438000	Yeah.
1438000	1440000	He's a good guy.
1440000	1441000	He's a great guy.
1442000	1445000	He tried to get in bed with me at the Disneyland Great California Hotel.
1447000	1453000	We were there doing an event for ABC, and he tried his hardest to get in bed with me.
1453000	1459000	And I was asleep, and he ordered everything on the room service menu.
1459000	1460000	Everything.
1460000	1463000	He ordered everything that was on the menu.
1463000	1464000	He ordered it up there.
1464000	1466000	And then just left.
1468000	1469000	Did he eat the food?
1469000	1470000	No.
1470000	1473000	He weighs as much as my shoe.
1474000	1481000	He ordered a thousand people's worth of food and then just ate like a bite of a cheeseburger
1481000	1485000	and then just fucked right off after trying to physically assault me.
1486000	1488000	Like he wanted to make love?
1488000	1489000	Yeah, yeah.
1494000	1498000	He was in my car one time, and his son was in the back.
1498000	1501000	And his son, I think, was not quite 21 yet.
1501000	1504000	I think he was like 19 or 20, and we were going to a bar.
1504000	1509000	So I've got Andy and his underage son in the back of my new Lexus.
1509000	1514000	And Andy pulls out of his coat a Heineken the size of a keg.
1514000	1516000	I must have told the story before the show, no?
1516000	1517000	I can't remember.
1517000	1518000	Have I?
1518000	1519000	No.
1519000	1521000	He pulls one of those giant Heineken's out, the big ones.
1521000	1525000	Like a Dave Klein Foster's, you know, kind of like a big-ass beer.
1525000	1530000	And opens it up, and it explodes all over every bit.
1530000	1535000	My face, every, the windshield, every part of the interior of my car
1535000	1539000	is covered in warm Heineken foam.
1540000	1542000	And it's nighttime.
1542000	1547000	We're driving down Hollywood Boulevard, and he's got the door open.
1547000	1551000	Like the door is fully open as I'm driving down the street,
1551000	1557000	and he's shouting the N-word at full volume to everybody that we pass.
1558000	1560000	Then we come to a stop around Hollywood and Vine,
1560000	1562000	like maybe Argyle, somewhere around there.
1562000	1566000	And guess who's about to cross the street? Black gentleman.
1566000	1569000	I'm like, Andy, fucking don't, don't.
1569000	1571000	I'm looking in the rearview mirror at his son,
1571000	1573000	and the son's looking at me like,
1573000	1576000	we both have a look like we may have to kill him.
1576000	1579000	We might have to kill Andy before he does, but he doesn't.
1579000	1583000	He's like a crying baby behind enemy lines in Vietnam.
1584000	1586000	What is it?
1586000	1587000	Shut that Andy dick up.
1587000	1588000	Smother him.
1595000	1599000	So he opens the door and starts screaming the N-word
1599000	1601000	at this middle-aged black gentleman
1601000	1605000	who sees it as Andy Vick and just gets a big kick out of it.
1609000	1612000	My car is covered, my car now smells like a warm Heineken.
1613000	1615000	And we get to this bar on Vine,
1615000	1618000	and we get in there, and I was so bummed out,
1618000	1620000	and Andy walks in, he has a broken finger,
1620000	1622000	and if you asked him why, he doesn't know.
1622000	1623000	He doesn't remember how he got it.
1623000	1625000	He's got a broken index finger on his left hand.
1625000	1627000	He sees a girl sitting with a cocktail,
1627000	1629000	and he puts his index finger in her drink,
1629000	1632000	like a brand-new, clearly just a vodka on the rocks,
1632000	1633000	just sticks his finger into her drink,
1633000	1635000	and then picks it up and walks off with it.
1635000	1637000	And this girl's like, what the fuck?
1637000	1640000	And I was like, what was that? A vodka?
1640000	1641000	She said, yeah, it was a kettle of rocks.
1641000	1643000	I was like, I'll get you a new drink.
1643000	1644000	She's like, who the fuck is this guy?
1644000	1647000	I go, do you know who Andy Vick is?
1647000	1648000	And he's like, no.
1648000	1651000	I'm like, it's better that you don't.
1651000	1653000	And I turned to his son.
1653000	1655000	I said, I'm going to beat your father up tonight,
1655000	1658000	and you're going to either help me or watch.
1658000	1661000	And he says, I will help you.
1662000	1665000	Yeah, so maybe they'll be here next week.
1666000	1671000	He is the best at being the worst.
1671000	1676000	He makes Dino look like me.
1678000	1680000	Yeah, they used to be a comedy team.
1680000	1681000	A lot of people don't know that.
1681000	1684000	They used to do like a two-man comedy act
1684000	1687000	where Andy would hit Dino as hard as he could,
1687000	1690000	and then Dino would get a boner or something.
1690000	1693000	I don't know what the punchline was.
1694000	1697000	I think they did like old Abbott and Costello routines,
1697000	1698000	but instead of slapping,
1698000	1702000	he'd actually really physically smash him.
1702000	1705000	Well, they have a podcast coming to Feral Audio.
1705000	1706000	What's it called?
1706000	1708000	Skulljuice.
1708000	1710000	Skulljuice?
1710000	1711000	Gross.
1711000	1712000	Skulljuice.
1712000	1714000	Well, listen at your own risk.
1714000	1716000	Yeah.
1717000	1718000	All right.
1718000	1722000	Well, who here has a problem that needs to be solved?
1724000	1726000	Young lady, your hand went up first.
1726000	1727000	I think I can see glasses.
1727000	1730000	Did you want to come up and share your problem?
1730000	1731000	All right.
1731000	1732000	Who do we got?
1733000	1735000	What's your name, Adam?
1735000	1736000	Oh, Gabrielle.
1736000	1737000	Hello.
1737000	1738000	Is it a madam?
1738000	1739000	I can't remember.
1739000	1740000	Is it?
1740000	1741000	Yes.
1741000	1742000	Okay.
1742000	1743000	Sorry.
1743000	1744000	I saw glasses and a ponytail.
1744000	1745000	Yeah, no.
1745000	1746000	We're in Los Angeles.
1746000	1747000	That's accurate.
1747000	1748000	So that's one of the problems.
1748000	1749000	Is it?
1749000	1750000	The gender dichotomy.
1750000	1751000	Oh, okay.
1751000	1753000	I know I can help with that.
1755000	1756000	You're the king.
1756000	1761000	I have a surgeon's touch with the gender politics.
1761000	1763000	The trans community loves me.
1763000	1764000	They trust me.
1764000	1765000	It's true.
1765000	1767000	They said that to me.
1768000	1770000	Where are the meetings again?
1770000	1773000	It's just like, it's actually like behind meltdown comics.
1773000	1776000	We just hang out around that.
1776000	1778000	If you need help with that logo, too.
1778000	1779000	Sure.
1780000	1783000	Well, so what's the, Gabrielle?
1783000	1785000	What is the, how can we help you?
1787000	1793000	I have chronic pain throughout the right side of my body.
1793000	1795000	I don't know how you can help me.
1795000	1796000	From an injury or from?
1796000	1799000	We can hit you very hard on the left side of your body.
1801000	1802000	Crazy balance.
1802000	1803000	That makes sense, yeah.
1804000	1806000	No, it's just the, yeah.
1806000	1811000	I've been to like more doctors in the past two years than I have in like my entire life.
1811000	1813000	How do you start?
1814000	1815000	Slowly.
1815000	1819000	Because with chronic pain, it's like you don't realize, you just think you're lazy and like
1819000	1820000	need to work out more.
1820000	1822000	So it's like eventually.
1822000	1823000	I'm sorry.
1823000	1824000	I'm ignorant about this.
1824000	1827000	Did it come from an injury or did it just kind of came on all of a sudden?
1827000	1830000	Yeah, it kind of came on like all of a sudden.
1830000	1835000	When I was like 20 or something, I started realizing like my body kind of sucked.
1835000	1837000	Are you currently in pain right now?
1837000	1840000	Yeah, it hurts like right here.
1840000	1846000	It's like, it gets better like, it gets better and worse, worse-ish.
1846000	1847000	What kind of pain?
1847000	1849000	Is it like a throbbing pain or a shooting pain?
1849000	1851000	It's almost like a numb pain.
1851000	1853000	It's like nerve pain?
1853000	1855000	Yeah, it's kind of like nerve pain.
1855000	1856000	Do you have the same thing?
1856000	1857000	Do you have the same thing?
1857000	1858000	Is it on one side?
1858000	1859000	Yeah, it's on the right side.
1859000	1861000	Do you know what it is?
1861000	1864000	Well, let's get you up here.
1864000	1866000	I told you we could help you.
1866000	1871000	We're going to build like a Voltron right now.
1871000	1879000	As long as you guys are okay becoming one person that's made of two left sides.
1879000	1880000	What's your name, miss?
1880000	1881000	I think we have the solution.
1881000	1883000	My name is Marina.
1883000	1884000	Marina?
1884000	1885000	Hello, Marina.
1885000	1886000	Hi.
1886000	1887000	Sorry, I kind of sucked you up here.
1887000	1889000	I didn't make sure that you would be okay coming up.
1889000	1892000	This is actually great because I have some advice for you too.
1892000	1893000	Oh, sweet.
1893000	1894000	Thank you.
1894000	1899000	I've got Lyme disease and so I've had to have multiple surgeries on my joints because they've
1899000	1903000	collapsed and you've got a nice little Frankenstein kind of scar here.
1903000	1908000	I've had nerve pain all throughout the right side of my body for it.
1908000	1913000	Then to doctors just like you, in and out of different pain clinics and stuff.
1913000	1917000	But I finally found something that works.
1917000	1920000	Sorry.
1920000	1922000	It's a tough thing.
1922000	1925000	Whereabouts, you said it's right about here?
1925000	1932000	Well, it kind of just goes throughout my body and so it becomes hard to...
1932000	1936000	It kind of goes up into my shoulder.
1936000	1942000	It starts down around this area, comes up, goes into my shoulder.
1942000	1948000	Then my neck hurts so much, it kind of makes my head all foggy all the time.
1948000	1949000	Okay.
1949000	1952000	I'm a massage therapist as well.
1952000	1955000	I can try something.
1955000	1956000	Sure.
1956000	1957000	This is great.
1957000	1962000	I didn't expect to come to Harman Town and get a massage.
1962000	1963000	Yeah, sure.
1963000	1965000	I don't know if I can drop the mic.
1965000	1968000	Is there a waiver that we have signed?
1968000	1970000	We're not a medical clinic.
1970000	1971000	This is all on her.
1971000	1972000	Okay.
1972000	1973000	Okay.
1973000	1978000	You are surrendering your safety to her.
1978000	1980000	This is all consensual.
1986000	1989000	I thought for sure it seemed like it was just that I think I might be able to help you.
1989000	1991000	I was like, if she said squarespace.com...
1991000	1993000	Yeah.
1993000	1996000	We're going to be rich.
1996000	1998000	Yeah.
1998000	2001000	Can we get the lights down a little bit lower right now?
2001000	2006000	I'm going to prepare your nerve damage with massage.
2006000	2010000	Yeah, to the break of time.
2010000	2012000	Yeah.
2012000	2015000	Get off my line.
2015000	2022000	Jeff's taking the leg that doesn't hurt.
2022000	2023000	Yeah.
2023000	2024000	Deep tissue.
2024000	2026000	Get inside.
2026000	2029000	Get in Gabrielle's neck with your fingers.
2029000	2031000	Marina.
2031000	2033000	Yeah.
2033000	2034000	Yo.
2034000	2038000	Marina means house on the water.
2038000	2042000	Yo.
2042000	2044000	Yeah.
2044000	2047000	The uninformed Spanish rapper.
2047000	2059000	Marina means place where you keep the boat and right now she's going to help float into
2059000	2065000	Gabrielle's pain and win the game with her healing fingertips.
2065000	2068000	Fucked your mama so hard.
2068000	2070000	Feeling back to Gab's hips.
2070000	2071000	Yeah.
2071000	2075000	All the joints.
2075000	2081000	Welcome to Harman Town Nights.
2081000	2084000	This shit got sexy as hell.
2084000	2086000	Yeah.
2086000	2088000	We had this experience.
2088000	2089000	Marina.
2089000	2090000	Thank you.
2090000	2093000	Did you learn this stuff because you had pain and then you went to the doctor and they're
2093000	2096000	like, I don't know, you figure it out.
2096000	2100000	Actually, I did learn because of an injury.
2100000	2108000	I used to run track and my friend was teaching me how to do it but he was like a foot taller
2108000	2109000	than me.
2109000	2116000	I was trying to run a hurdle and I tore my hamstring and the trainer was there and taped
2116000	2119000	me up and it was awesome and she just worked on my legs a bit.
2119000	2122000	I was like, whoa, this is magical.
2122000	2125000	Why don't I do this every single day?
2125000	2128000	So I went to school for it and it was awesome.
2128000	2137000	You got really comfortable with your body because you got to be naked.
2137000	2142000	Just when you show up for class?
2142000	2144000	You work on each other.
2144000	2146000	Do you work on a little Tokyo by any chance?
2146000	2147000	No, no, no.
2147000	2148000	Actually, stopped.
2148000	2149000	I'm a writer now.
2149000	2155000	I'm a future writer for Cracked.com now and I do research too.
2155000	2161000	With all this stuff, I can't do a massage so much anymore but you said that helped?
2161000	2162000	Yeah, it does.
2162000	2163000	Fantastic.
2163000	2164000	Thank you.
2164000	2169000	Another thing with this chronic pain is actually kind of a rant for me.
2169000	2176000	DEA really pisses me off.
2176000	2178000	There's a nice thing though.
2178000	2184000	I'm not on nearly so many painkillers as it used to be because I discovered something
2184000	2185000	really awesome.
2185000	2192000	A lot of alternative medicine is bullshit but there's actually a really good thing called
2192000	2193000	cratum.
2193000	2196000	I don't know if any of you guys have heard of it.
2196000	2200000	It's from Thailand, Malaysia, that area.
2200000	2203000	I've been making this tincture out of it and it's totally worked.
2203000	2209000	I have some with me if you would like to try it at some point.
2209000	2213000	This is related to your trouble with the DEA, right?
2213000	2215000	What is that?
2215000	2217000	Can you tell us more what cratum is?
2217000	2219000	Is it a plant?
2219000	2220000	It is a plant.
2220000	2222000	Isn't that what spice is made out of?
2222000	2227000	No, at least not to my knowledge.
2227000	2230000	If it is, spice would be probably pretty expensive.
2230000	2232000	It's a funny thing.
2232000	2239000	There used to be a humongous opium problem in Thailand I believe it was.
2239000	2242000	It was just one of those countries over there.
2242000	2246000	Somewhere around the Golden Triangle.
2246000	2248000	One of those flyover countries.
2248000	2249000	Yeah, there you go.
2249000	2252000	Places that you just don't go.
2252000	2258000	The government was actually providing a lot of this opium and they were discovering that
2258000	2263000	people were chewing the leaves of the cratum tree that grew just everywhere and they were
2263000	2268000	not addicted to opium anymore because it actually works to get you off of it.
2268000	2274000	So they made it illegal and also started shopping down all the trees so that they could
2274000	2277000	get people hooked on opium again.
2277000	2278000	It's currently illegal there.
2278000	2280000	It's illegal I believe in Canada.
2280000	2282000	It's illegal in the UK.
2282000	2283000	Illegal you're saying?
2283000	2285000	Yeah, illegal, but it's legal here.
2285000	2287000	It's called cratum.
2287000	2290000	K-R-A-T-O-M.
2290000	2292000	People are still kind of...
2292000	2293000	Sounds like a He-Man villain.
2293000	2297000	Yeah.
2297000	2302000	So the DEA has been looking at it and like, oh, people are getting high on this.
2302000	2304000	They're actually enjoying themselves.
2304000	2306000	We've got to get rid of this.
2306000	2308000	This is not going to bode well.
2308000	2311000	You get high on it, but it also gets you off of opium?
2311000	2312000	It gets you, yeah.
2312000	2314000	It absolutely works for any kind of petroleum.
2314000	2317000	If you're not on opium, do you think it might get you on it a little bit?
2317000	2318000	Is it going to be a gateway?
2318000	2319000	I don't know.
2319000	2321000	Also, my other question is are you holding right now?
2321000	2322000	No.
2322000	2323000	I don't...
2323000	2324000	I never had opium.
2324000	2327000	Where can a guy get some cratum in this town is my question.
2327000	2329000	I get it online.
2329000	2331000	Just powder stuff and then I make it.
2331000	2333000	You can also go to Cratum Beryl, right?
2333000	2338000	It's a...
2338000	2339000	I don't know.
2339000	2341000	Adam Goldberg isn't here anymore.
2341000	2342000	I thought I'd...
2342000	2343000	Cratum Beryl.
2343000	2346000	I thought I'd do what he'd shout out.
2346000	2348000	Now, Gabrielle, back to you.
2348000	2349000	Yes.
2350000	2354000	Is there anything that goes beyond just your chronic pain?
2354000	2356000	What else is going on with it?
2359000	2360000	I don't know.
2360000	2364000	Just my existential pain.
2364000	2366000	My...
2366000	2368000	No, just like...
2368000	2369000	No, I don't...
2369000	2370000	You have a great ponytail.
2370000	2372000	This ponytail is rocking.
2372000	2373000	It is a wonderful ponytail.
2373000	2374000	Yeah.
2374000	2375000	And you do...
2375000	2376000	We kind of skipped over it.
2376000	2378000	You identify as female?
2378000	2379000	Yeah.
2379000	2381000	Do you want to be referred to as she, her?
2381000	2382000	Yes.
2382000	2383000	Yes.
2383000	2384000	Mom.
2384000	2385000	No, I'm kidding.
2385000	2388000	I'll call you mom if you want.
2388000	2390000	No, no, no, no, no.
2390000	2394000	I was saying it as if my mom was listening.
2394000	2396000	Call me a girl.
2396000	2399000	Is this an awkward way for your mom to find out maybe?
2399000	2401000	Does your mom listen to Harman Town?
2401000	2402000	No, no.
2402000	2404000	Does mom know or not know?
2404000	2405000	Yeah, no.
2405000	2406000	I told them.
2406000	2407000	I told them through text.
2407000	2410000	I told them through a long text.
2410000	2413000	What emoji went along with that one?
2413000	2419000	And like the non-smoking sign, but also like a dick.
2419000	2421000	Is that the eggplant?
2421000	2422000	Is this like the eggplant?
2422000	2423000	Yeah, I guess so.
2423000	2424000	Yeah, yeah.
2424000	2425000	That's...
2425000	2427000	Awesome.
2427000	2428000	All right.
2428000	2431000	So, where do we go from here?
2431000	2432000	Credo, am I still...
2432000	2433000	Okay, so it's still...
2433000	2436000	You can still get it in the United States through websites and stuff.
2436000	2437000	Yeah, yeah.
2437000	2446800	But it's currently still legal, soon to be illegal, sort of opiate fighter, a bottlenose
2446800	2450000	dolphin to Opium's shark.
2450000	2451000	Yep.
2451000	2453000	It gives you a lot.
2453000	2457000	Michael Winslow to Opium's radio head.
2457000	2461000	And that they should learn to get along before the camera shows up.
2461000	2462000	Yeah, it gets you out of the...
2462000	2463440	It'll get you out of the pain clinics.
2463440	2464640	It's pretty fantastic.
2464640	2466560	You can make it at home very easily.
2466560	2467560	I've just...
2467560	2473320	If you just happen to have like 190-proof corn liquor laying around, then that's all
2473320	2474320	you need.
2474320	2475320	Some mason jars.
2475320	2476320	You're good.
2476320	2477320	But it's changed my life completely.
2477320	2478320	I just have like great...
2478320	2481320	Tell us more about your run-ins with the DEA again.
2481320	2484320	Because what you're talking about sounds highly illegal.
2484320	2485320	I've never...
2485320	2486320	Oh, no.
2486320	2487320	I've never had any run-ins with the DEA.
2487320	2488320	You might not.
2488320	2489320	Because I'm not...
2489320	2490320	Oh, yeah.
2490320	2491320	I might now.
2491320	2492320	But no.
2492320	2493320	I just...
2493320	2494320	You know Gabriel's mom works for the DEA.
2494320	2495320	Yeah.
2495320	2496320	This has been a sting.
2496320	2497320	Okay.
2497320	2500400	Marina, you're wearing a Wonder Woman shirt.
2500400	2505440	Are you a long-time fan of Wonder Woman as a myth, or are you...
2505440	2511120	Have you been recently converted by the Superman Batman movie, or did you just like the way
2511120	2512840	the shirt looked, or...
2512840	2513840	I love...
2513840	2517120	I'm a comic book nerd big time for games, comics.
2517120	2518120	Yeah.
2519120	2520120	I love Wonder Woman.
2520120	2521120	Are you looking forward to the new movie?
2521120	2522120	I am.
2522120	2523120	It's about goddamn time.
2523120	2524120	I have a bet with my friend.
2524120	2526120	I bet on Suicide Squad.
2526120	2532360	I bet that it would be over 70% on Rotten Tomatoes with my brand new shirt.
2532360	2533920	We bet on a pizza.
2533920	2539720	But he said we could double or nothing on Wonder Woman, so I'm hoping I get two pizzas.
2539720	2542920	What's your side of the bet on Wonder Woman?
2542920	2543920	I guess 70.
2543920	2544920	Same thing.
2544920	2545920	Oh, okay.
2545920	2546920	70%.
2546920	2547920	I'm betting on mediocrity.
2548720	2550320	What's the team working on Wonder Woman?
2550320	2551320	Who's the director?
2551320	2552320	Patty Jenkins.
2552320	2553320	She did Rollerball.
2553320	2554320	Roller...
2554320	2555320	No, no, no.
2555320	2556320	Monster Ball.
2556320	2557320	Monster Ball?
2557320	2558320	No.
2558320	2559320	Monster Ball?
2559320	2560320	Roller Monster Ball?
2560320	2561320	Monster Ball.
2561320	2562320	Okay.
2562320	2563320	The Halle Berry.
2563320	2564320	There's a thing.
2564320	2565320	I was reading an article now.
2565320	2569080	I guess it's no accident that the thing now is to take...
2569080	2576840	They're not getting the big, gigantic Rockstar names, which are probably almost as hit-and-miss
2576840	2582200	really as anybody else in these giant, what they call, tentpole movies.
2582200	2586960	Because they're so expensive and they come with the ability to go, no, I need five years
2586960	2589120	and I need you to get out of my face.
2589120	2591160	They're working with first-timers a lot.
2591160	2596760	They're really green directors and they're having just as much success as failure, really.
2596760	2598760	So, yeah.
2598760	2599760	I don't know.
2599760	2600760	I thought that was interesting.
2600760	2604760	I was like, oh, I didn't know this was part of a big sea change, but that's what it is.
2604760	2609440	I think DC just tried to catch up really fast with Marvel.
2609440	2614560	They failed at Batman versus Superman and the tone that they wanted.
2614560	2621080	So with Suicide Squad, they were like, let's make Guardians of the Galaxy 2.5.
2621080	2622080	Yeah.
2622080	2629200	I mean, nothing opened our eyes to the importance of the rating like Deadpool.
2629200	2634040	That's such an easy thing to talk about now is to just go, look, is it going to be rated
2634040	2635040	R or not?
2635040	2641000	Because if you're going to, if the word edgy is going to be in the menu and it's not going
2641000	2645120	to be rated R, then you might as well embrace the non-edge, you know?
2645120	2646920	Yeah, absolutely.
2646920	2649560	What was the second, what was the Heath Ledger Batman movie?
2649560	2650560	Was that PG-13?
2650560	2651560	PG-13.
2651560	2652560	PG-13.
2652560	2654320	They managed it.
2654320	2656800	I guess the key is you have to be violent and not sexual.
2656800	2657800	Exactly.
2657800	2658800	You just have to murder people.
2658800	2659800	Exactly.
2659800	2660800	We are so terrified of boobs.
2660800	2661800	It's ridiculous.
2662560	2668920	But yeah, I don't want to spoil anything for anybody but Suicide Squad, but who here has
2668920	2670720	seen it so far?
2670720	2671720	It's got some...
2671720	2672720	I love that.
2672720	2673720	I love that too.
2673720	2674720	You fucking assholes.
2674720	2675720	Yeah.
2675720	2683400	So it looked just from the trailer like I'm speaking way out of school here because I
2683400	2685280	was never like, I was never on board with the whole movie.
2685280	2687520	You predicted what the whole movie was about.
2687520	2688640	Oh, I did.
2688640	2689640	I ran down the...
2689640	2690640	That was fun.
2690640	2693640	That was a fun car ride to work.
2693640	2697080	And I did see in an article, I saw a spoiler that said I was right about the...
2697080	2698080	Yeah.
2698080	2699080	Of course it's.
2699080	2700080	Yeah.
2700080	2701080	I don't know.
2701080	2707320	But I thought it was interesting, like Harley Quinn, I mean, I understand the political
2707320	2715080	climate calls for a more actualized Harley Quinn, like an autonomous Harley Quinn with
2715080	2716080	agency.
2716080	2721980	But at the same time, how much can you make her appropriate before she stops being Harley
2721980	2722980	Quinn?
2722980	2728240	When I was watching the trailer, I was like, well, I thought she was a guilty pleasure
2728240	2729240	character.
2729240	2730240	I thought she was sort of like...
2730240	2732480	Like put another female character in a Suicide Squad movie.
2732480	2735120	Who feels guilty about Harley Quinn's pleasure?
2735120	2736120	What'd you say?
2736120	2737120	Do you feel guilty about...
2737120	2739040	Well, sure I do.
2739040	2743360	If I'm enjoying her and really the only place I've consumed her is Batman, the Arkham video
2743360	2744360	games.
2744360	2748680	I think that's where my relationship with Harley Quinn happens.
2748680	2756120	She comes on screen and I go like, okay, I get it, I understand.
2756120	2761480	It's so over the top that it's like, I would say, this is fine as long as you put a bunch
2761480	2764320	of post, post, posts on the front of whatever this is.
2764320	2766920	It's post, post, post, post, feminist or whatever.
2766920	2770320	Because she's the archetype of the...
2770320	2776400	She is really supportive as a girlfriend to the point of absolute self-destruction.
2776400	2779840	She has no identity of her own.
2779840	2780840	So then we're making her...
2780840	2783080	She almost looks like she's the protagonist of Suicide Squad.
2783080	2788320	Actually, interestingly, the protagonist of Suicide Squad is Will Smith, who's really
2788320	2792720	kind of playing himself more than Deadshot.
2792720	2798400	He's this family man who, weirdly enough, spends most of the movie without his mask,
2798400	2802000	and then in the comics, he's got the mask on the entire time.
2802000	2807280	And the thing is, the Suicide Squad, I don't think this will spoil too much, but it's got
2807280	2814800	some troubling messages in it, because the ultimate moral of the story in the end kind
2814800	2818800	of suggests that it's totally okay to...
2818800	2825400	That a good guy is okay with his daughter doing trigonometry by talking about shooting
2825400	2827200	people from buildings.
2827200	2830800	It's like, oh, well, let me find the hypotenuse here.
2830800	2832800	That's the ultimate moral?
2832800	2837480	Yeah, that is what they're talking about, because he's this family man.
2837480	2839760	Is this his character?
2839760	2843680	Because Deadshot, his whole character is good at shooting, right?
2843680	2844680	Yeah.
2844680	2846640	But in the movie, is he doing math?
2846640	2849000	Is it a beautiful mind in the background?
2849000	2850000	No.
2850000	2851000	I wish.
2851000	2852000	No, he's...
2852000	2853000	Oh, man.
2853000	2856000	Does he have a little baby shot daughter?
2856000	2857000	Is that what you're...
2857000	2858000	Is it like...
2858000	2859000	That's a sequel.
2859000	2860000	No, it sounds like it's not.
2860000	2861000	It sounds like you said he's a family man.
2861000	2864000	He's got a little girl, and she's...
2864000	2870520	Oh, I almost spoiled something, but she's involved with something, but yeah, no, no.
2870520	2876160	At the end of it, he's doing math with her, and he says, at one point in the movie, I
2876160	2880240	just don't want my daughter to think I just want to do something, some of my daughter
2880240	2884640	doesn't think I'm a piece of shit, even though I murder people for money.
2884640	2885640	Yeah, he's a supervillain.
2885640	2886640	It's just...
2886640	2887640	Yeah.
2887640	2888640	But he doesn't want to look like a piece of shit.
2888640	2889640	And the movie is tone.
2889640	2890640	Yeah.
2890640	2891640	Well, yeah.
2891640	2892640	Yeah.
2892640	2901280	The tone kind of switches off throughout the whole movie, because if it would stay consistent,
2901280	2905280	that would have been cool, you know, but instead it kind of tries to make you feel good about
2905280	2906280	that.
2906280	2907280	Right.
2907280	2911680	That he gets with his daughter, and that she starts embracing the part of him that is a
2911680	2917560	murderer, and, you know, they try to give you this sort of fuzziness about that.
2917560	2918560	Oh, right.
2918560	2922080	That's like at the end of the Steve Jobs thing, where she's like, I guess iPods are kind
2922080	2925120	of cool, except it's like assassination.
2925120	2926120	Yes.
2926120	2932360	Marina, I've got this pain in my neck right now.
2932360	2934440	I can fix it.
2934440	2939720	I guess the thing that the trailer promised, you know, is that, oh, the government's like,
2939720	2945240	hey, you know, much similar to the Marvel X-Men universe, it's like, oh, how can we
2945240	2946240	trust these people?
2946240	2949360	Like, they're flying around and they're doing whatever they want.
2949360	2951360	Well, what if Superman goes crazy one day?
2951360	2954520	And I don't know how that gets you to, what about the villains?
2954520	2958040	What if Superman wants to kill the president?
2958040	2962240	Let's put bombs on all the supervillains' houses and hide them in the White House.
2962240	2967280	What I would understand is they would go like, well, what if you ask Superman to kill ISIS
2967280	2971240	and he won't do it because that's wrong, you know, like that he would just wants to
2971240	2972240	arrest them.
2972240	2973240	Like, I'm not kidding.
2973240	2978780	Like, shouldn't it just be like the Pentagon going like, well, Batman doesn't follow orders
2978780	2980960	and Superman's such a boy scout.
2980960	2984440	Like, how about some of these people that those guys don't get along with so well?
2984440	2989560	What superhero damage you hire if you were the president to kill ISIS or take care of
2989560	2990560	ISIS?
2990560	2997240	Well, I'd go to Superman first for everything, whether it's opening a bottle or killing ISIS.
2997320	2998960	Are you willing to do this?
2998960	3000280	I know he wouldn't lie.
3000280	3002400	Let's say Superman and Batman pass.
3002400	3004400	Who do you go to next?
3004400	3007400	How are the ducks?
3007400	3008400	Oh, shit.
3008400	3009400	How are the ducks?
3009400	3011600	Oh, what?
3011600	3012600	The DC universe.
3012600	3013600	I don't know.
3013600	3019240	I mean, you know, it'd be nice to give Aquaman a try and just feel bad for him.
3019240	3021240	It's as much as ISIS is near the Gulf.
3022240	3023240	Yeah, I was kidding.
3023240	3026240	It's still a little landlocked area.
3028240	3032240	If we can get them near the Euphrates River.
3032240	3039240	Well, I would go to Wonder Woman because she's a woman and, you know, I would go like, look,
3039240	3045240	Google them and have at it.
3045240	3046240	You know, do whatever you want.
3046240	3049240	Keep whatever you keep.
3050240	3052240	See you in November.
3052240	3054240	What happens in November?
3054240	3055240	Elections.
3058240	3063240	I guess I assumed I was a president running for re-president.
3063240	3064240	Is that what they call it?
3064240	3066240	So is this re-election for you?
3066240	3067240	Yeah, I guess.
3067240	3071240	You're the incumbent president trying to get re-election.
3071240	3073240	You asked me, who am I killing ISIS with?
3073240	3074240	I don't know.
3074240	3075240	It was a tough question.
3075240	3076240	I was surprised by it.
3076240	3077240	I don't know.
3078240	3080240	I think Wonder Woman is a pretty great answer.
3080240	3081240	You're wearing a shirt.
3081240	3084240	Yeah, I'm kind of biased, I guess.
3084240	3091240	Gabrielle, who do you think, what super villain or team is best equipped to kill ISIS?
3091240	3092240	Godzilla.
3093240	3095240	Fuck shit.
3098240	3103240	If we had like two or three straight up Godzillas, just send them in there.
3103240	3109240	I heard a really funny thing about, you know the 2000 Godzilla movies, the one that's like Matthew Broderick?
3112240	3114240	I didn't expect that response.
3114240	3120240	It was like a sequel because they have all the Japanese, so they just keep on making Godzilla movies.
3120240	3127240	And in that movie, they said that that Godzilla and Godzilla brought Matthew Broderick wasn't a real Godzilla.
3127240	3131240	Like Americans just assumed it was Godzilla because it was a big lizard.
3131240	3133240	And so they just kill it on screen.
3133240	3136240	And they're just like, that wasn't a real Godzilla.
3136240	3141240	So they can do that with Superman, too, because everyone hates this one.
3141240	3142240	Oh, yeah, sure.
3142240	3145240	I mean, I never understand how those movies are connected.
3145240	3153240	Like Marvel's doing a little better job of making sure you get the, you know, this is a larger story.
3153240	3160240	I know that DC, this seems like they're kind of, I'm not rooting for either over the other.
3160240	3165240	Just keep making comic book movies rather than, you know, historical period pieces.
3165240	3176240	Gabrielle, if you hire Godzilla to go in and take care of Isis, can you give Godzilla instructions or does he just kind of do his own shit?
3176240	3179240	How do you give him operational like...
3179240	3181240	I don't know, does Godzilla have a favorite food?
3181240	3184240	You just like put it, you just put it in your Isis and...
3184240	3186240	I think electricity?
3186240	3188240	Play the song, yeah.
3189240	3195240	In the latest Godzilla movie, he's got this weird interspecies bromance with that one soldier.
3195240	3199240	Whoever saw the latest one, yeah.
3199240	3201240	Joe Gilamerican.
3201240	3202240	Yes.
3202240	3209240	So get that guy and make sure you bring Ken Watanabe, you know, so he can go, you know, just...
3209240	3213240	Because he has this weird mind link with Godzilla as well.
3213240	3222240	Also, King Kong, it occurs to me, at least like the original movie King Kong and then also the 80s, Jeff Bridges, one.
3222240	3230240	He's like really into women, like two, like so he probably would...
3230240	3235240	I think you could turn him loose on the Middle East as well, like if you had an enemy.
3235240	3238240	But I think there'd be a lot of collateral damage, I just don't know, you know.
3238240	3246240	Wasn't there a comic that, oh yeah, it was like a Frank Miller comic where it was originally like Batman Kills the Al-Qaeda or something.
3246240	3248240	Yeah, it was a real thing, right?
3248240	3250240	Yeah, he beat it to it.
3250240	3252240	How'd he do it?
3252240	3254240	I don't know, I didn't read it.
3254240	3255240	We should just do that.
3255240	3257240	I think he knows.
3257240	3258240	I have a question.
3258240	3260240	Oh, okay.
3260240	3262240	I was wrong.
3262240	3265240	I don't have a show, so you may as well ask it, yeah.
3266240	3270240	What is the worst job that you would tolerate doing?
3270240	3272240	The worst job that I would tolerate doing.
3272240	3274240	Dan, specifically?
3274240	3276240	You're asking me.
3276240	3282240	Dan, this is Doug Philburn from the Washington Post.
3282240	3285240	His question is, what's the worst job you would tolerate doing?
3285240	3291240	That's a really interesting question because what's the worst job you would tolerate doing?
3291240	3294240	So first you have to ask yourself, what's the worst job?
3295240	3301240	I'm pulling in a paycheck, but this is the lowest I'll go.
3301240	3306240	Yeah, the word tolerate kind of needs to be explored there.
3306240	3310240	Let's say you're broke.
3310240	3312240	I'll put some parameters on this.
3312240	3313240	You're broke.
3313240	3318240	This is a minimum wage job.
3318240	3320240	Minimum wage job is all you can have.
3320240	3325240	What's the worst thing that you would say, okay, I'll get up every morning and do this thing?
3325240	3329240	And right below that is a job, fuck it, I won't do it.
3329240	3331240	Well, but I won't do it, meaning what?
3331240	3333240	I'd rather die.
3333240	3336240	You'd rather go hungry and just die.
3336240	3338240	Or turn to crime.
3338240	3341240	Is crime a job?
3341240	3346240	Because if it's like, oh, you can eat shit for $4 an hour, you can eat human shit.
3346240	3349240	Well, no, give me your wallet.
3349240	3351240	Well, what are you, some kind of criminal?
3351240	3353240	Yeah, it pays more.
3353240	3355240	Well, yeah, but crime never pays.
3355240	3357240	Well, it pays more than eating shit.
3357240	3360240	And you can't beat the hours.
3360240	3362240	I'm out of here.
3362240	3366240	I would never want to be a criminal, but I don't want to eat the shit.
3366240	3372240	So I don't know, I'm just trying to, I want to be able to answer the question dutifully.
3373240	3378240	I was a dishwasher and I was awful at it, but I kept trying to be good at it.
3378240	3386240	I don't know, I mean, it was pretty, it was, if I was good at it, if I thought I could have gotten good at it,
3386240	3392240	I think I could have kept doing it because it would be like, oh, but I know there's worse jobs
3392240	3396240	because Jay Johnston used to, we worked at a fucking shit plant.
3396240	3399240	He worked at the place where they clean shit.
3399240	3406240	And Shrab worked at a place in Mayville where he scrubbed the rims of tanks where they keep the shit.
3406240	3408240	I kind of think I can't.
3408240	3410240	Why does that need to be scrubbed?
3410240	3413240	I gotta keep that.
3413240	3417240	I guess if you think about it, it's like, well, why does it need to be in a tank?
3417240	3419240	And the answer is because it's got to be boundaries, you know?
3419240	3424240	So I guess it's like, so I know it's simultaneously ridiculous, but then it's like, well, you know,
3424240	3427240	it's like, hey, it's a tank full of shit, so why should the rim be clean?
3427240	3429240	And then you'd be like, well, why should the outside be clean?
3429240	3431240	Why should the place where the tank is be clean?
3431240	3433240	Why should the city be clean, I guess?
3433240	3435240	I'm just trying to get inside their heads.
3435240	3436240	I'll ask you this.
3436240	3437240	I'll tell you what.
3437240	3443240	If I was in charge of civilization, the minute we got to the point where we needed to build a shit tank,
3443240	3445240	I'd be like, we got to break up.
3445240	3447240	Let's go our separate ways.
3447240	3451240	Let's stick to tribes of 100 people.
3451240	3453240	We found a good yardstick.
3453240	3458240	For me, it was because you can't remember more than 100 people's names.
3458240	3463240	Somebody just asked me a question about that.
3463240	3468240	Well, they were like, somebody asked me because we were in San Francisco and before that we were in Montreal,
3468240	3474240	so I've been experiencing a lot of people recognizing me coming up to me and saying, thank you.
3474240	3476240	You helped me through a lot.
3476240	3477240	Can I get a picture with you?
3477240	3484240	People just attention that you don't normally get in the course of your day-to-day life.
3484240	3488240	Somebody said, what do you think about that?
3488240	3490240	Do you get bored with that?
3490240	3491240	Do you not like that?
3491240	3494240	I think it's like vitamin C.
3494240	3498240	I think it's something that everyone else gets zero of.
3498240	3503240	I think you're supposed to get it 10 times a day.
3503240	3506240	I'm not using vitamin C as an analogy anymore.
3506240	3510240	I think that if you lived in a tribe of 100 people,
3510240	3514240	I think that every single person equally, whether you were the guy that made the shoes,
3514240	3519240	or the person that made the roofs, I'm like, gender, gender, gender.
3519240	3527240	The woman that made the big pipes, the welding, or the guy that cut all the hair.
3527240	3533240	I live in a fucking beam of light.
3533240	3541240	Everybody would know each other's name.
3541240	3544240	They wouldn't say, hey, can I take a selfie with you?
3544240	3546240	It would be the same energy.
3546240	3548240	I acknowledge what you do.
3548240	3551240	Thank you, Glenn, for those shoes you made my kids.
3551240	3553240	They fit good today, or whatever.
3553240	3557240	Boy, those roofs held up great last night under the rain, etc.
3557240	3561240	Everybody would have that feeling several times a day.
3561240	3566240	The only people that actually get it are Brad Pitt and Donald Trump.
3566240	3569240	It's like, oh, look, there he is.
3569240	3573240	It's a thing that you should actually get a dose of.
3573240	3579240	It's like communism, but for empathy.
3579240	3582240	Popularity.
3582240	3589240	I just think we're not meant biologically to live 300 million to a teepee.
3590240	3598240	I think our bodies, our muscle cells, and our nerve cells, and our brain cells,
3598240	3607240	still think that we're a chimp that recently learned to talk and swing sticks around.
3607240	3610240	That's actually true.
3610240	3617240	According to certain studies, your brain can only, or rather the different primates,
3617240	3623240	the different sizes of brains can only hold a certain number of other primates
3623240	3627240	and recognize them as the same species.
3627240	3630240	The number for ours is about 165 people.
3630240	3634240	Which is the exact size of a multi-game sitcom's audience.
3634240	3636240	That's why we play that sound over and over.
3636240	3639240	You watch Big Bang Theory and you're like, oh, I'm being comforted.
3639240	3641240	I hear my tribe laughing with me.
3641240	3644240	We don't play the sound of six million people laughing.
3644240	3647240	Because then we go, wait, it's the ghost of the Holocaust.
3647240	3650240	I picked that number.
3650240	3652240	I could have picked any number.
3652240	3659240	Anyone outside of that number of 165 people is literally not human to you.
3659240	3664240	Dan, would you rather, if you had the choice, study job cleaning out the poop tank,
3664240	3669240	like the guy that gets down there with the hip waders on and scrubbing out the poop tank,
3669240	3672240	or life of crime and do whatever you want.
3672240	3677240	You had to actually figure out your own way to be a burglar or a pickpocket
3677240	3679240	or a safe cracker or whatever.
3679240	3680240	What would you pick?
3680240	3682240	Safe poop job or free?
3682240	3687240	I literally have to choose between poop, poop tank and that.
3687240	3691240	Poop tank and find your own adventure crime.
3691240	3696240	You have to get up in the morning and go, oh, shit, am I a burglar?
3696240	3698240	Do I carjack people?
3698240	3700240	I have to do something illegal.
3700240	3703240	This is like a super villain origin story.
3703240	3704240	Kind of.
3704240	3708240	He was working in the poop and then one day he couldn't take any more.
3708240	3713240	Would you rather wake up and go, shit, I don't want to commit crimes every day
3713240	3718240	and risk going to jail or hurt other people or steal their property.
3718240	3720240	I will do the poop job.
3720240	3722240	Do you think you could be a good bank robber?
3722240	3724240	No, I don't think I'd be a good bank robber.
3724240	3725240	Is it for minimum wage?
3725240	3726240	Huh?
3726240	3727240	Is it just for minimum wage?
3727240	3728240	Let's say $20 now.
3729240	3736240	Yeah, I have questions about standard of living because there's people in the...
3736240	3737240	It's a good union job.
3737240	3742240	If I scrub that poop tank from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
3742240	3745240	The union, you would only be doing probably eight hours a day.
3745240	3750240	If I scrub that poop tank like dutifully, do my job, show up, then clock up.
3750240	3752240	Dutifully.
3752240	3755240	You ask me these questions and then you're shrobbing me, man.
3755240	3756240	Solid.
3757240	3765240	If I do that and then I come home and I can support a partner offspring,
3765240	3767240	I mean, that's where everything comes into play.
3767240	3769240	A livable wage at the poop tank.
3769240	3771240	Well, but does that really mean?
3771240	3774240	It's just livable wage because we've changed the goal post on a generation of Americans.
3774240	3776240	You're not going to be living high on the hog.
3776240	3778240	You're going to be making poop tank money.
3779240	3784240	But I can have a Christmas where my kids don't cry because maybe they got the Optimus Prime
3785240	3788240	I think it depends on how much poop comes in that year.
3790240	3795240	And then there's the question of upward mobility and retirement.
3795240	3799240	I mean, am I guaranteed to be able to clean that poop tank for 30 years
3799240	3802240	or am I a sucker if I do it for 20 and then they tell me...
3802240	3809240	I'm talking a steady union wage poop tank job that you're never going to be rich
3809240	3812240	but you will always put bread on the table.
3813240	3819240	I think I would take that, but that is making a lot of assumptions about like,
3819240	3827240	yeah, I would want to try that if I really had a guarantee of like,
3827240	3831240	I can just do this every day and there's a certain amount of years I can do it
3831240	3833240	where I get the pocket watch and the pension and blah, blah, blah.
3833240	3835240	But by the way, that's a myth now.
3835240	3838240	That's the problem that people are waking up to is that you can't do that anymore.
3839240	3843240	So I have to emphasize that that's actually kind of a weird blue sky universe
3843240	3844240	where you could do that.
3844240	3846240	That's like some Lego world where you're like,
3846240	3848240	I'm a poop cleaning guy and I can do that.
3848240	3850240	That's the problem is that then Flint, Michigan goes like,
3850240	3852240	no, fuck you, you don't make cars anymore.
3852240	3854240	And people are like, what do you mean?
3854240	3856240	We're always going to have to clean poop tanks.
3856240	3858240	Poops, like that's always going to happen.
3858240	3860240	We're having two different conversations here.
3862240	3866240	Because the reality is there's like the blue sky with all these like
3866240	3871240	trigonometric like sort of like everything being equal
3871240	3873240	just so we can focus on the thing I would choose.
3873240	3876240	But then if we were just living in reality,
3876240	3881240	how I understand this country to operate and how things are going,
3881240	3885240	I would choose the crime job because I know that the poop tank job
3885240	3891240	is going to be very much very similar to living in prison,
3891240	3894240	like where I am only just working to stay out of trouble
3894240	3897240	and I'm only getting enough money to stay in debt
3897240	3901240	and that I'm not going to be able to support my kids eventually.
3901240	3903240	Something's going to be curve balls thrown
3903240	3905240	and I'm going to be told to go fuck myself.
3905240	3908240	Like knowing that that's going to happen because we've dropped those,
3908240	3910240	like there's no guarantees.
3910240	3913240	And I'm not being Michael Morin saying like we owe it to the workforce,
3913240	3918240	not necessarily, I'm just saying like knowing as a subjective person
3918240	3923240	that I think the myth of retirement and the myth of that job is over.
3923240	3925240	I would go, I'm a smart guy.
3925240	3928240	I could probably figure out how to steal shit from people
3928240	3930240	that deserve to have shit stolen from them.
3930240	3933240	And like once I get caught and go to jail,
3933240	3935240	it'll be a lot like cleaning shit tanks.
3935240	3939240	Isn't that, I feel like that's like most criminals, right?
3939240	3944240	No criminals like I want to do this because it's a bad thing.
3944240	3945240	Right.
3945240	3946240	They do it because they're like.
3946240	3947240	They don't want to be a sucker.
3947240	3948240	Yeah, they want to like.
3948240	3951240	Welcome to the podcast sympathetic to criminals.
3952240	3956240	But I also think there's a lot of terrible people, sociopaths that go like,
3956240	3960240	well, I think we're severely lacking too in our national psyche
3960240	3962240	in terms of like, you know, we don't know.
3962240	3964240	It's a syndrome.
3964240	3965240	It's the whole thing.
3965240	3970240	Like there is no signal of this is what integrity is sent down from the top.
3970240	3973240	There's no, it starts with the, you look up above you
3973240	3975240	and you see people are greedy and horrible
3975240	3977240	and they get away with whatever the fuck they want.
3977240	3980240	And they don't share their profits
3980240	3983240	and they don't make any promises that they can keep.
3983240	3986240	And so you go like, I don't want, it doesn't start with like,
3986240	3987240	I'm so mad and I'm going to get mine.
3987240	3989240	It starts with, I don't want to be a sucker.
3989240	3992240	I don't want to like do this for 15 years and then get fucked over.
3992240	3995240	Like, so you go, somebody goes like, hey, I could, you know,
3995240	3997240	if you take this off the top, you can sell it
3997240	3999240	and like your family can get a thing.
3999240	4001240	Like I basically was all on movies.
4001240	4005240	I don't know what the actual, but also just kind of common sense.
4005240	4006240	I think that's.
4006240	4008240	Spencer, have you ever stolen anything?
4008240	4010240	Oh, all the time.
4010240	4012240	I never stop.
4012240	4013240	For real.
4013240	4014240	You hear about that?
4014240	4015240	Give a shop.
4015240	4016240	Let's shine Jane glass.
4016240	4018240	Oh yeah.
4018240	4019240	That was you all along.
4019240	4020240	Oh yeah.
4020240	4022240	You never shoplifted or boosted anything.
4022240	4024240	You know, I mean, I don't know.
4024240	4026240	I think I've taken a couple of candy bars as far as people
4026240	4028240	I talked to in general.
4028240	4031240	People have shoplifted a lot more than I have
4031240	4033240	because it's like a weird thing.
4033240	4037240	They say you do it until you get caught, but I've only done like five times.
4037240	4039240	I didn't tell my mom caught me.
4039240	4041240	I was like, do you know what you're doing?
4041240	4043240	And I was like, well, I'm taking candy.
4043240	4044240	Like they have so much of it.
4044240	4048240	And she was like, if everyone took candy, there wouldn't be candy.
4048240	4050240	They'd have to raise the prices of the candy and also.
4050240	4051240	Yeah.
4051240	4052240	And I was like, oh, I didn't.
4052240	4053240	I never got like shamed for it.
4053240	4057240	I got caught like, I got caught like with, with like,
4057240	4060240	I think it was like a thousand dollars of sunglasses,
4060240	4063240	but it was like, it was that phase.
4063240	4065240	It was like that phase in high school where like,
4066240	4069240	I just had like sunglasses.
4069240	4071240	It was even like sunglasses I wanted.
4071240	4074240	It was an open, I was with my friends and it was an open thing.
4074240	4077240	And we were just like, oh, we, this is, we have this power.
4077240	4078240	Right.
4078240	4081240	And it's like, for the first time in your life, you have access to,
4081240	4084240	uh, uh, like social capital.
4084240	4085240	Right.
4085240	4088240	And, and it's, it, it feels like you, you figured out a secret path.
4088240	4089240	Yeah.
4089240	4090240	So you took them?
4090240	4091240	Yeah.
4091240	4092240	And then I got caught.
4092240	4093240	They bring you to the back room.
4093240	4094240	Well, a thousand dollars.
4094240	4095240	That's grand theft.
4095240	4096240	I know.
4096240	4097240	Were you over 18?
4097240	4100240	I like, I like cried a lot and, and they left.
4100240	4102240	Were you over or under 18 years old?
4102240	4104240	Under, I think it was under.
4104240	4105240	No, no, no.
4105240	4106240	I was, I think I'm over.
4106240	4107240	Yeah.
4107240	4108240	You can do time for that shit, man.
4108240	4109240	Yeah.
4109240	4110240	That was lucky.
4110240	4115240	Uh, I got, uh, I, I got caught stealing when I was five.
4115240	4118240	Um, I didn't trust you.
4118240	4127240	When I was, when I was five, they were, I was supposed to pick up two keys of, of,
4127240	4132240	of Kratum at the loading docks.
4132240	4135240	Motherfuckers stepped on it.
4135240	4136240	I took a toot.
4136240	4138240	I knew what was going on.
4138240	4140240	I had to jack them.
4140240	4142240	Marina style.
4142240	4147240	So there was, there was massage involved because I felt bad for him afterwards.
4147240	4150240	Wait, there was a massage based crime.
4150240	4151240	Yeah.
4151240	4152240	She can kill you with massage.
4152240	4154240	If she, if she can heal pain, she can cause it.
4154240	4155240	She's like a cleric.
4155240	4156240	I can make you through it.
4156240	4157240	Yes.
4157240	4158240	There you go.
4158240	4159240	Yeah, totally.
4159240	4160240	It's like spa.
4160240	4161240	Uh, yeah.
4161240	4163240	I approve of that joke.
4163240	4164240	Spencer approved.
4164240	4172240	I had taken a teddy bear to the grocery store, um, and stole a five pound bag of jelly beans
4172240	4175240	because I was very ambitious and also economic.
4175240	4178240	What if the teddy bear never came back into the story?
4178240	4179240	Use it.
4179240	4180240	You took a teddy bear to the grocery store.
4180240	4184240	It was just my teddy bear took it and I hid the bag behind, uh, behind the bear.
4184240	4185240	Okay.
4185240	4186240	Against my chest and I made it.
4186240	4193240	I got out and went home and, uh, went into, I had this sesame street tent in my bedroom
4193240	4195240	and I, but I just had no patience.
4195240	4197240	So I opened the bag and started eating them.
4197240	4203240	And I didn't realize this, but I left like a trail of jelly beans leading to the tent.
4203240	4208240	So my, uh, my parents found me and, uh, they told me, they made me go back to the store
4208240	4216240	after giving me a long lecture about how I had tarnished the family name and, uh, just
4216240	4218240	dragged it through the mud.
4218240	4222240	And we lived in a very small, I grew up in a fishing village and so everybody knew everybody.
4222240	4225240	That's why your name is Marina.
4225240	4228240	She is Wonder Woman.
4229240	4233240	So, um, so yeah, I had to apologize, uh, for that.
4233240	4237240	And, uh, my parents had weird ways of teaching me, uh, moral lessons.
4237240	4244240	When I was about the same age, I, we, we went to New York and I saw, um, uh, a little person
4244240	4246240	for the first time in my life.
4246240	4247240	I didn't think he was real.
4247240	4253240	I thought he was a puppet that somebody had just ingeniously designed to walk on its own.
4253240	4259240	So I just, just was just, he had a little suit and a little briefcase.
4261240	4269240	And so I was just marveling over this mechanical man to, to my brother, just, you know, making a scene.
4269240	4276240	And, uh, my mom made me, uh, get up off the, uh, subway seat and offer my seat to him,
4276240	4279240	even though he already had a seat of his own.
4280240	4282240	Yeah, but take hers.
4283240	4286240	All the more delicious for your tiny buttocks.
4287240	4289240	These are, these are padded with revenge.
4289240	4292240	We, we have a family name to protect you.
4294240	4296240	What is your family's name?
4300240	4304240	We can't drag the name of McGillicuddy through this sort of filth.
4305240	4308240	It was Eller, but that's, you know, nobody.
4308240	4315240	Yeah, no, I mean, uh, so you went all the way to robot right away.
4317240	4319240	It was the only thing that made sense.
4319240	4321240	I didn't know this was a thing.
4321240	4324240	And, uh, I just had to, had to figure out how.
4324240	4328240	There was a, there was a guy, uh, in South Milwaukee.
4328240	4330240	Uh, uh, God damn it.
4330240	4331240	What was his name?
4331240	4332240	It was a robot.
4332240	4337240	It was a, no, there was a, my grandma would go, do you want to go?
4337240	4338240	Damn it.
4338240	4339240	What was his name?
4339240	4340240	It was something.
4340240	4342240	He was, it was a title.
4342240	4344240	It was like, like, like, do you want to go to this McDonald's?
4344240	4346240	It was McDonald's in South Milwaukee.
4346240	4347240	He's the brownie, right?
4347240	4348240	Yeah.
4348240	4349240	Yeah.
4349240	4350240	And his name was like, oh, Billy the brownie.
4350240	4358240	Um, I, I, I, I, I, I was fucking like scared shitless by, um,
4358240	4360240	the concept of little anything.
4360240	4365240	Um, uh, when I was a kid, I, I had nightmares about, uh, marionette puppets
4365240	4369240	and, and, and regular puppets and just anything small.
4369240	4372240	Like, I just, I just thought was trying to kill me, like dolls and things.
4372240	4375240	I just, they, they were all just terrified of all of them.
4375240	4379240	And there was a guy named Billy the brownie that hung out at the McDonald's.
4379240	4384240	I, my grandma would make it seem like he was part of the McDonald's mythos,
4384240	4385240	but he wasn't.
4385240	4387240	I guess I grew older.
4387240	4389240	I was like, wait, I had a right to be freaked out.
4389240	4392240	There's no Billy the brownie in these commercials.
4392240	4394240	This was just a fucking dude.
4394240	4397240	Like, like, like, like, like, like in that Donald Sutherland movie,
4397240	4399240	like, uh, mash.
4399240	4403240	No, uh, no, I don't look now.
4403240	4405240	Google, don't look now.
4405240	4408240	Like, like, like, uh, but, but, but, but like, uh, it's a seventies,
4408240	4412240	like thriller horror movie, but, uh, it, but it was like, it was like, like,
4412240	4415240	like, like, like, he was just, he was just a guy that was there.
4415240	4417240	He would, and he would dress as a brownie and he would come to your table
4417240	4418240	and like talk to you.
4418240	4421240	Like the dessert or the, uh, the fairy?
4421240	4422240	The fairy.
4422240	4423240	Oh, yeah.
4423240	4425240	Like the fairy, like the, like, uh, like the mythical creature.
4425240	4426240	Sorry.
4426240	4427240	I didn't clarify that.
4427240	4430240	I mean, she would, yeah, Billy the brownie, like the little person.
4430240	4432240	He was a little person and he would dress like a, no, I do.
4432240	4434240	He wouldn't dress like a brownie.
4434240	4436240	My grandma maybe just called him Billy the brownie.
4436240	4441240	It sounds like she created this whole thing.
4441240	4443240	I don't think he didn't dress like a fucking rent fair.
4443240	4445240	Like, I think he was just a dude that was trying to like,
4445240	4446240	maybe have his breakfast.
4446240	4449240	He could have been a truck driver.
4449240	4451240	So your grandma called him Billy the brownie.
4451240	4452240	Yeah.
4452240	4455240	And I know I'm realizing like maybe that beat me and Billy the brownie were
4455240	4457240	both being abused by my grandma.
4457240	4461240	Like, like, like, like put into a can, like two wasps and just shake, shaken.
4461240	4463240	Like, like, like, hey, here, talk to him.
4463240	4464240	He's Billy the brownie.
4464240	4465240	And I'm like, what the fuck?
4465240	4468240	And he's like, what the fuck?
4468240	4471240	I never, yeah, I would, I was real scared of Billy the brownie.
4471240	4475240	And there was a, there was a, there was a, uh, there was a marionette doll that
4475240	4479240	my mom had in the closet that she called Clemencee Clemens, who had this is
4479240	4481240	like this weird, like, like, what is that?
4481240	4484240	Like, it's like, it was like, it's like paper mache, but like hardened.
4484240	4488240	It was like, like this little guy had a little, little straw hat on and it's
4488240	4489240	just all fucked up.
4489240	4493240	Like, look at like, she'd like bring it out once in a while and be like,
4493240	4494240	it's Clemencee Clemens.
4494240	4496240	And I go, get it out, get it away.
4496240	4500240	It's a fucking horrific, horrible little murderer.
4500240	4504240	It was like, like, like, like Freddy Krueger looking thing with strings coming
4504240	4506240	out of every joint.
4506240	4508240	It's like, controlling it.
4508240	4509240	It's like a spider.
4509240	4511240	It's like, like, like everything about it.
4511240	4513240	It's fucking terrifying.
4513240	4514240	And then she'd like, oh, it's okay.
4514240	4515240	Okay. Okay.
4515240	4516240	You pussy.
4516240	4518240	I'm putting it back in the Tupperware container and putting it in the closet.
4518240	4521240	Like, yeah, the closet across from my bedroom.
4521240	4524240	Like, I now know like Clemencee Clemens is just in there.
4524240	4527240	Like, like, like, like something about me.
4527240	4528240	Yeah.
4529240	4531240	I'm the one like, okay, Clemencee Clemens.
4531240	4533240	Daniel doesn't like you.
4533240	4534240	Might as well.
4534240	4537240	You guys, you got to go back to sleep in this, this, this plastic container
4537240	4538240	across from his bed.
4538240	4540240	Does he have a backstory?
4540240	4541240	Clemencee Clemens?
4541240	4542240	Was that like a hobby of hers?
4542240	4544240	I don't know if my mom made that at all.
4544240	4546240	Is it Clemencee or Clemencee Clemens?
4546240	4547240	Oh, Clemencee Clemens.
4547240	4549240	Is it Clemencee Clemens?
4549240	4550240	Oh, God.
4550240	4551240	Yeah.
4551240	4552240	See, it's weird.
4552240	4553240	It's like a New Line Cinemas, like horror movie.
4553240	4556240	Like, it's like, like I say, oh, it's Clemencee Clemens.
4557240	4559240	He wants Clemencee from his Tupperware.
4559240	4561240	For his horrible murders.
4561240	4564240	He's still waiting for that pardon.
4564240	4566240	I'm going to have nightmares about Clemencee Clemens.
4566240	4568240	I'm picturing the closet and the Tupperware.
4568240	4570240	Oh, we all will.
4570240	4571240	Yeah.
4571240	4572240	Yeah.
4572240	4575240	And I used to, I used to have, I had nightmares, I had recurring nightmares
4575240	4579240	about a character that was like a little puppet that was like, I guess it was
4579240	4580240	because of Mr. Rogers.
4580240	4582240	He had like the little puppet characters.
4582240	4586240	Like the boomerang, boomerang lady, boomerang, lady fairchild.
4586240	4587240	That was scary.
4587240	4588240	Boomerang lady.
4588240	4589240	Yeah.
4589240	4592240	There was like a, there was a version of her and my nightmares that was
4592240	4594240	always tormenting me.
4594240	4599240	Well, I had a, I always had a recurring nightmare where I'd be like, it would
4599240	4604240	be like, you know, it was like a black background with, with only just like
4604240	4608240	well lit fog on the ground, you know, like one of those dreamscapes.
4608240	4609240	And it's midnight.
4609240	4614240	And I know it's midnight because there's this Muppet style grandfather clock
4614240	4618240	and he strikes midnight and when he strikes midnight, he shoots arrows into
4618240	4619240	my body.
4619240	4620240	Oh my God.
4620240	4623240	And I get struck by 12 arrows.
4623240	4625240	It was a recurring nightmare I had.
4625240	4626240	Dealing 20 damage.
4626240	4629240	I was just going to say that.
4629240	4630240	Yeah.
4630240	4633240	It was a critical hit.
4633240	4636240	Respectfully loud guy is raising his hand.
4636240	4637240	Yeah.
4637240	4638240	I have another question.
4638240	4639240	Okay.
4639240	4640240	All right.
4640240	4641240	I don't know.
4641240	4642240	Your last one, your last one got us somewhere.
4642240	4643240	I don't know about that.
4643240	4644240	I keep believing in you.
4644240	4645240	Doug Filburn from the post.
4645240	4646240	Yeah.
4646240	4647240	I had another question.
4647240	4654240	So you're on a plane and the plane crashes on a deserted island and everyone
4654240	4655240	survives.
4655240	4660240	Now you're on an island with 165 people and Sir Dan Harmon, they look to you
4660240	4661240	as the leader.
4661240	4664240	Because Seth Rogan's not on the flight.
4665240	4670240	So now you have to create a civilization, right?
4670240	4672240	So what does that government look like?
4672240	4675240	And one thing I was thinking...
4675240	4678240	The plane happens to crash on a desert island?
4678240	4680240	Think of the odds of that.
4680240	4682240	I mean...
4682240	4683240	Oh, you get washed up.
4683240	4686240	What if that island was on the moon?
4686240	4688240	Like the premise of Harman Town.
4688240	4690240	Right.
4690240	4691240	Yeah.
4691240	4692240	I don't know.
4692240	4695240	What does someone have to do to get banished?
4695240	4698240	How does a punishment system work?
4698240	4700240	What if someone's being a real dick?
4700240	4703240	But there's only 165 people on this island.
4703240	4706240	How many are there of us tonight, Harman?
4706240	4710240	Well, the easy thing is what if someone's being a real dick.
4710240	4713240	That's the whole problem with the justice system of any government is that we
4713240	4717240	always conceive of what if someone's being a real dick.
4717240	4721240	And then we go, okay, well, if that happens, then we'll do this to them.
4721240	4723240	And then we wait for someone to be a real dick.
4723240	4725240	And then we do that to them.
4725240	4727240	And that's about 1% of the cases.
4727240	4729240	And the rest of it is like, well, I was hungry.
4729240	4730240	I needed bread.
4730240	4731240	But I didn't mean it.
4731240	4733240	I thought it was mine and all this shit.
4733240	4735240	And then everyone's calling each other being a real dick.
4735240	4738240	And you're still using the same mentality.
4738240	4739240	That's like...
4739240	4742240	I guess I would try to figure out beforehand.
4742240	4743240	I mean...
4743240	4748240	When we start our moon colony, I'm just going to bring only beta people.
4748240	4754240	They're going to be screened for the inability to aggress.
4754240	4756240	So that we can all just like...
4756240	4759240	Because we had a fun experience where we were shuffling around.
4759240	4760240	What was it?
4760240	4761240	Montreal?
4761240	4762240	Team beta, yeah.
4762240	4764240	Yeah, we were the beta tribe.
4764240	4766240	Like, Jeff got peeled off somehow.
4766240	4768240	Otherwise, Jeff would be making all the decisions.
4768240	4770240	And we would be tumbleweeds and stuff.
4770240	4772240	There was mounting things of stress.
4772240	4774240	It was like, we don't know what we're doing.
4774240	4775240	We don't know what we're doing.
4775240	4778240	Cody has confided to me in the past.
4778240	4781240	Sometimes I'll turn into a little baby when I'm walking around with her.
4781240	4783240	Without realizing it.
4783240	4785240	Sometimes she'll be doing that to me.
4785240	4787240	Because it's like...
4787240	4793240	There's usually someone in the group that's more comfortable having opinions.
4793240	4795240	And let's go here, let's go there.
4795240	4798240	We just happened to be with a group of five or six people.
4798240	4800240	And none of them were that person.
4800240	4802240	And we were just kind of drifted for a while.
4802240	4804240	Like a garbage bag in American Beauty.
4805240	4807240	But there was still cohesion.
4807240	4810240	And there was mounting points of frustration.
4810240	4814240	You could feel like Spencer was doing the opposite of a shark.
4814240	4816240	Where he was circling the idea of leaving.
4816240	4820240	Like Spencer would just start getting more and more distant.
4820240	4823240	But then he'd come back.
4823240	4826240	And we eventually started making random decisions.
4826240	4829240	And we had a really nice dinner in that one restaurant.
4829240	4830240	Or a lunch or something.
4830240	4832240	I don't remember.
4833240	4835240	But it was nice. It was really nice.
4835240	4838240	But I just don't know, man.
4838240	4843240	Because the thing is, people are monsters.
4843240	4847240	They don't... I don't know.
4847240	4850240	I don't know if I believe in people anymore.
4850240	4854240	I have a riddle for you about how to tell if you're a serial killer.
4854240	4856240	Or if you could become a serial killer.
4856240	4858240	Maybe you'll restore your...
4858240	4860240	Sorry.
4862240	4864240	Continue.
4864240	4866240	The doctor was a woman.
4866240	4868240	What's the matter?
4868240	4870240	If any of you guys...
4870240	4873240	Let's see who here has the mind of a serial killer.
4873240	4877240	If you can answer this riddle, then you have the mind of a serial killer.
4877240	4880240	Regardless of whether or not you already have a body count.
4883240	4885240	That's a good point.
4885240	4889240	If you're just a really stupid serial killer, you get off scot-free.
4889240	4892240	Yeah, if you're stupid, you'd think you'd get caught, though.
4892240	4894240	You could just be a killer, though.
4894240	4896240	No, but what if you're a really cowardly one?
4896240	4898240	That's the thing that freaks me out all the time.
4898240	4899240	I look at people and I go,
4899240	4902240	the only thing standing between that person and being a serial killer
4902240	4904240	is that they're just a little chicken shit.
4904240	4909240	I feel like that person, if they could do bad shit and get away with it, they would.
4909240	4912240	If I had a boat, you'd all be dead.
4914240	4916240	You gotta have a boat.
4916240	4919240	I would never hurt anybody if I could get away with it.
4919240	4920240	I truly believe that.
4920240	4923240	And then at the same time, I think that's most of us.
4923240	4927240	And the weird thing is, we spend most of our energy in society building
4927240	4930240	trying to make it possible for us to not have to think about
4930240	4933240	how we're hurting people without thinking about it.
4933240	4934240	You know what I mean?
4934240	4936240	That's the biggest...
4938240	4941240	That's how we make the trains run out of time.
4941240	4943240	That's an act of killing.
4943240	4945240	That's the whole thing, right?
4945240	4946240	Yeah, I mean...
4946240	4947240	Their whole culture.
4947240	4948240	Well, no, no, no.
4948240	4949240	I guess not.
4949240	4950240	Yeah, I mean...
4950240	4952240	Yeah, act of killing was...
4952240	4956240	I mean, that's an example of the fact that as long as anybody up top
4956240	4959240	is just saying, this is fine, if they're not...
4959240	4961240	If the people you're killing have a label on them,
4961240	4965240	like communist or terrorist or criminal or murderer or whatever,
4965240	4968240	like, and no one ever flips the game on you,
4968240	4970240	that you can actually walk through life going like,
4970240	4974240	oh yeah, and then I did that thing where I was an awesome person.
4974240	4978240	But it's interesting that they keep on going to the same stories
4978240	4981240	because it's like the thing they can't escape.
4981240	4983240	Yeah, there's some weird thing haunting them
4983240	4984240	and eating away at them,
4984240	4986240	which is kind of an uplifting thing possibly
4986240	4988240	that maybe there is something in there.
4988240	4991240	But anyways, I think the thing is it's like,
4991240	4993240	we try to make it as easy as possible.
4993240	4995240	Spencer and I were talking about this.
4995240	4996240	So dichotomy...
4996240	4998240	We talked about it all, man.
4998240	4999240	Dichotomy is a crutch.
4999240	5000240	That's the thing.
5000240	5003240	Every single aspect of our society,
5003240	5007240	it always comes down to some choice between one or two things.
5007240	5010240	The big thing is obviously the candidacy right now,
5010240	5014240	the elections, throughout our lives are left and right.
5014240	5015240	Every comment section is like,
5015240	5017240	you're either one of these or one of those.
5017240	5022240	And that is actually an expression of en masse laziness.
5022240	5027240	Because if you only have to choose whether you're this or that,
5027240	5030240	you save so much fucking time.
5030240	5032240	Having to think every second,
5032240	5035240	what am I, who am I, how do I feel?
5035240	5036240	If you just go like,
5036240	5038240	oh, I don't want to be like that.
5038240	5039240	I'm not one of those.
5039240	5042240	And then now you're just hanging out.
5042240	5043240	You're like, well, I'm a liberal,
5043240	5046240	so I have six hours to play Minecraft.
5046240	5050240	Because if there was no word for liberal or conservative,
5050240	5052240	then I would have to spend that six hours going like,
5052240	5053240	yeah, but what about my neighbor?
5053240	5055240	What about my neighbor's daughter?
5055240	5056240	What about that homeless guy in the corner?
5056240	5057240	What about that?
5057240	5063240	It's the same reason, like writing in films and TV are so shitty,
5063240	5064240	like diversity-wise.
5064240	5065240	Because it's hard.
5065240	5070240	It's just hard to, it's harder to get fine people of color
5070240	5072240	because there's no infrastructure.
5072240	5074240	I blame casting agencies.
5074240	5076240	Well, diversity is difficult, right?
5076240	5079240	And the first thing, the first way that we tackle diversity
5079240	5081240	is we break that into an economy.
5081240	5083240	We go white or colorful.
5083240	5084240	And then we'll...
5085240	5086240	And it's not necessarily that we're,
5086240	5088240	and people are like racist, racist.
5088240	5089240	It's not like we hate,
5089240	5091240	it's not necessarily that all casting directors
5091240	5092240	hate black people.
5092240	5095240	It's that all casting directors like to go home early.
5095240	5099240	We told casting directors for 80 years now,
5099240	5105240	we told them they better get good at sorting human beings,
5105240	5108240	like documents in a filing cabinet or coats in a rack,
5108240	5109240	or they're fired.
5109240	5111240	So if I can't call my casting director and go,
5111240	5114240	I need a six foot five black guy with a lazy eye,
5114240	5116240	it's not like in 1983,
5116240	5119240	like the person that can do that is like a better casting director.
5119240	5121240	Now all of a sudden it's like,
5121240	5126240	no, we're gonna engage in the fucking unpredictable nuances of humanity.
5126240	5129240	They're like, does that include me?
5129240	5131240	Because I'm like a dentist for people,
5131240	5133240	like each tooth is a person on your cast.
5133240	5138240	And so, yeah, it is like that, that, particularly.
5138240	5140240	You want them all to be really white.
5141240	5143240	Yeah, by default.
5143240	5144240	Yeah.
5144240	5147240	You got that one kind of weird brown tooth.
5147240	5148240	Yeah.
5148240	5149240	Yeah, white and straight.
5149240	5152240	And I've certainly stumbled into a pretty good metaphor.
5152240	5155240	It's like all different shaped white people that, yeah.
5155240	5159240	You got your Paul Giamatti who grinds the food.
5159240	5164240	You got your Paul Rudd in front who's just fighting it and, you know.
5166240	5169240	Yeah, anyways, I got sidetracked by that.
5169240	5171240	But I kind of like simultaneously.
5171240	5173240	What's the serial killer riddle?
5173240	5174240	Oh, okay. All right.
5174240	5175240	So anybody?
5175240	5177240	Because you're either a serial killer or you're not.
5177240	5178240	Oh, yeah.
5178240	5179240	That's the dichotomy.
5179240	5181240	Dichotomies, yeah.
5181240	5182240	All right.
5182240	5183240	So there's a funeral.
5183240	5186240	A woman goes to a funeral for her mother.
5186240	5189240	And when she's there, she meets this amazing guy.
5189240	5192240	He's just the guy, the man of her dreams.
5192240	5196240	She's instantly in love with him and she really wants to see him again.
5196240	5199240	They have a great time at the reception, somehow,
5199240	5201240	despite the fact that it's her mother's funeral.
5201240	5205240	But they don't exchange contact info.
5205240	5208240	And a week later, her sister dies.
5208240	5209240	Why?
5209240	5213240	If you can answer that, then you can think like a serial killer.
5213240	5215240	No, she goes home and kills her sister.
5215240	5218240	So thank you, Tom.
5218240	5220240	He's heard this riddle.
5220240	5223240	Why is there a stranger at her mom's funeral?
5223240	5225240	That's part of it.
5225240	5226240	That's part of it.
5226240	5228240	That's part of it.
5228240	5229240	Oh.
5229240	5231240	Because if the dude's at the mom's funeral,
5231240	5233240	it's probably going to be at the sister's funeral.
5233240	5234240	Good job.
5234240	5235240	You got it.
5235240	5236240	Thank you, Doug from the Post.
5236240	5237240	Thank you very much.
5237240	5238240	Yeah.
5238240	5241240	Well, they estimate that up to 25% of Americans are sociopaths,
5241240	5243240	so one out of every four.
5243240	5245240	But sociopaths aren't psychopaths, right?
5245240	5247240	No, that's different.
5247240	5248240	There's a difference.
5248240	5250240	And there's also a very big spectrum.
5250240	5254240	So one, two, three, four.
5254240	5258240	25% are sociopaths.
5258240	5260240	I don't know.
5260240	5263240	If you're a sociopath, you could probably take us all out
5263240	5265240	if you banded together.
5265240	5266240	Just think about it.
5266240	5270240	If you kill somebody's sister to meet her at a funeral,
5270240	5275240	you might be a sociopath.
5275240	5278240	Yeah.
5278240	5280240	If we're going to have a show where everybody can talk
5280240	5284240	whenever they want, you guys have to let each other talk, too.
5284240	5286240	You can't just talk over each other.
5286240	5287240	Then I get confused.
5287240	5289240	You're all sociopaths.
5289240	5291240	Like, what the fuck is going on?
5291240	5294240	Everyone's just talking at the same time.
5294240	5296240	Oh, Dan took a dark turn.
5296240	5298240	I guess he...
5298240	5301240	No, my heart bleeds for everybody who's like,
5301240	5303240	I have a little piece of information I'd like to share.
5303240	5307240	And then everyone's like, I'm going to do a bit.
5307240	5312240	I have another question.
5312240	5315240	Yeah.
5315240	5318240	Doug from the Post has another question.
5318240	5320240	What's your next question, Doug?
5320240	5322240	What's on your mind, Doug?
5322240	5326240	Could you walk us through a day when Spencer and Jeff
5326240	5329240	woke up in each other's bodies?
5329240	5332240	The question is, could Dan walk all of us...
5332240	5335240	Are you just pitching spec scripts now?
5335240	5339240	It sounds like some weird slash shit.
5339240	5343240	Can Dan pitch a day where Spencer and I
5343240	5345240	are in each other's bodies?
5345240	5347240	I mean, that happened in Montreal.
5347240	5350240	There was a little bit of a...
5350240	5354240	I was inside Spencer, but I wouldn't say I was...
5354240	5355240	Inside his body?
5355240	5356240	I would say you were.
5356240	5358240	Part of me was inside Spencer's body.
5358240	5362240	Look, I was fucking... and I mean fucking Spencer.
5362240	5364240	He was fucking me.
5364240	5366240	I mean fucking me.
5366240	5367240	I don't know.
5367240	5370240	Well, I think the important thing to answer your question
5370240	5374240	is the first quarter of the story before that happens
5374240	5377240	because that would happen at the threshold.
5377240	5379240	Because first you'd have to establish that Jeff
5379240	5384240	is very into his clothes and that he doesn't have time
5384240	5390240	for dice and that Spencer...
5390240	5392240	I've got no time for dice.
5392240	5395240	He loves dice but doesn't care about clothes
5395240	5397240	and then Spencer... and then there's like a magic die
5397240	5399240	or something and they're both trying to grab it
5399240	5401240	and they go like, you have it better than me
5401240	5404240	and you know...
5404240	5407240	And then it would just be like, you know,
5407240	5410240	another 20 minutes of them going like, holy shit,
5410240	5412240	well, I guess we...
5412240	5414240	We don't have time to figure out how to fix this
5414240	5416240	because I have a dice convention to go to.
5416240	5419240	But you have to go for me because you're in my body.
5419240	5421240	If I woke up in Spencer's body and go,
5421240	5423240	I have to go make it through my day
5423240	5425240	and I am in Spencer's body.
5425240	5427240	I think that would be pretty easy.
5427240	5429240	I think that...
5429240	5433240	This is way easier than having to go to the dry cleaners
5433240	5435240	and pick up a suit.
5435240	5437240	If you were in Spencer's body,
5437240	5440240	would you go and find a suit, though?
5440240	5443240	No, I think what I would do is luxuriate
5443240	5445240	in not having to wear a suit.
5445240	5447240	It's like suit vacation.
5447240	5449240	Yeah, suit vacation.
5449240	5451240	I mean, that's the name of the movie.
5451240	5453240	It's suit vacation.
5453240	5455240	It might be called...
5455240	5457240	Die and Tie.
5457240	5459240	Die and Die.
5459240	5462240	But meanwhile, Spencer would be showing up to...
5462240	5465240	Well, I'm going to depend because in the Switcheroo movie,
5465240	5467240	you've got to have the scene where...
5467240	5472240	where you have to go dungeon master.
5472240	5474240	Also, I would...
5474240	5475240	Oh, I'm Spencer.
5475240	5478240	And I look in the mirror and I go, oh, my God, I'm Spencer.
5478240	5480240	I look like Spencer.
5480240	5482240	My suits aren't going to fit anymore.
5482240	5484240	We're different body shapes.
5484240	5486240	I have to get to this thing.
5486240	5488240	I only have Spencer clothes.
5488240	5490240	You have to get to Harman Town.
5490240	5492240	Exactly.
5492240	5494240	Well, that would be pretty easy compared to the other films.
5494240	5496240	Spencer, if you woke up and you were me,
5496240	5498240	you would say, oh, shit.
5498240	5502240	You could put on cargo shirts and a t-shirt.
5502240	5504240	Oh, yeah, you can rock those.
5504240	5506240	We know this.
5506240	5507240	Would you wear a suit?
5507240	5510240	Would you go into my closet and go, I'll cosplay as Jeff's?
5510240	5513240	So do we start in each other's houses?
5513240	5515240	Let's just say yes.
5515240	5516240	Okay.
5516240	5518240	Let's say that that's accessible.
5518240	5519240	Well...
5519240	5521240	Listen, you wake up in each other's bodies.
5521240	5524240	That's one of those, like Blake Edwards Switched
5524240	5526240	or whatever with Jimmy Smits and...
5526240	5528240	It's like Freaky Friday.
5528240	5529240	Exactly.
5529240	5530240	Well, yeah, you wake up.
5530240	5533240	So you wake up in Jeff's apartment in Jeff's body.
5533240	5534240	And you're naked.
5534240	5536240	You wake up in Spencer's apartment.
5536240	5538240	Well, first off, I immediately start jerking up.
5538240	5540240	Right.
5540240	5542240	I'd kill myself.
5542240	5544240	Because you've got to go, like, what is Spencer?
5544240	5545240	You both jerk off.
5545240	5547240	There's a split screen as you both come.
5547240	5551240	It's like an anime, like, ah!
5551240	5554240	Like a two-man Voltron.
5554240	5557240	So then you're done coming, and now you go to the...
5557240	5559240	You go to the closet.
5559240	5561240	You open the closet and, like...
5561240	5563240	You clean up the...
5563240	5564240	No.
5564240	5565240	You clean up the closet.
5565240	5566240	It's someone else's body.
5566240	5568240	Yeah.
5568240	5571240	It's not my responsibility.
5571240	5572240	Yeah.
5572240	5573240	Yeah.
5573240	5575240	It's not my department anymore.
5575240	5578240	Yeah.
5578240	5579240	All right.
5579240	5580240	So I wake up in Spencer's place.
5580240	5582240	I'm looking around, and I go, okay.
5582240	5583240	Oh, I'm naked.
5583240	5584240	I just jerked off.
5584240	5586240	Came all over Spencer's bedroom.
5586240	5587240	Yeah.
5587240	5589240	All I got is Spencer clothes.
5589240	5590240	I'm going to dress in Spencer clothes.
5590240	5594240	I don't think I'd go right out and start buying suits that fit Spencer's body.
5594240	5595240	I think I'd just go, fuck it.
5595240	5596240	I'm Spencer.
5596240	5597240	Nice.
5597240	5598240	Right?
5598240	5601240	Would you be Spencer, or would you try to be Jeff, but in Spencer's body?
5601240	5605240	Well, do I still have the will and the volition that I have?
5605240	5606240	Never mind.
5606240	5607240	Yeah.
5607240	5610240	No, I mean, I guess I would start having to make some decisions of, like, who...
5610240	5612240	What is a physical Jeff Davis?
5612240	5616240	Like, is it Jeff Davis only about, like, caring about his clothes and his hair?
5616240	5619240	Or is it, like, growing a beard all of a sudden?
5619240	5620240	I mean, there has to be...
5620240	5623240	First, you have to come up with, like...
5623240	5625240	It's a tough movie to break.
5625240	5626240	It's a good question, Doctor.
5626240	5630240	It's high risk, low reward, like this project, you know?
5630240	5634240	Because it's going to end up with a skateboard chase and, like...
5634240	5636240	It's just not going to matter.
5636240	5639240	Which one of us isn't comfortable with a skateboard?
5639240	5642240	It's going to be a forced arc, because it's not...
5642240	5646240	Because a body switching movie, again, to support our point about dichotomy being a
5646240	5650240	crutch for, like, a lazy psyche, it's like, oh, yeah, of course, if you just take
5650240	5655240	Jodie Foster and whoever her mom was, like, you swap them, then you automatically
5655240	5660240	have to reduce each character to, like, I'm neat, she's therefore sloppy, like, et cetera,
5660240	5661240	you know?
5661240	5662240	Well, fuck it.
5662240	5664240	You become Jeff, Jeff becomes Spencer, and Spencer becomes you.
5664240	5665240	Now it's not a dichotomy.
5665240	5666240	It's a trichotomy.
5666240	5668240	Yeah, we just solved.
5668240	5669240	Now the movie just follows.
5669240	5672240	When did Doug get the fucking conch on this fucking thing?
5673240	5676240	I want to hear what you were saying about the sociopath.
5676240	5678240	She was talking about, like, the...
5678240	5681240	She said 25% of Americans are sociopaths.
5681240	5685240	I have one question there, which is, is it just America, or was it...
5685240	5686240	Okay.
5686240	5689240	That's just where they did the study, or did they know for a fact that other countries
5689240	5691240	have a much lower sociopath?
5691240	5694240	Japan was, like, up to 3%.
5694240	5696240	No way.
5696240	5698240	What?
5698240	5700240	Now, are we relying on each country?
5701240	5702240	The sociopath next door.
5702240	5703240	Oh, man.
5703240	5708240	The sociopath next door, for those of you who want to research, we'll touch base again.
5708240	5715240	It's like, what was the show with Cosby, the magic pen?
5715240	5716240	Picture pages.
5716240	5717240	Yes, yes.
5717240	5719240	I forgot, and then I was like, Cosby?
5719240	5720240	Really?
5720240	5721240	Okay.
5721240	5727240	But I just give up magic, like, if everybody gets together and goes, let's figure out how
5728240	5731240	many sociopaths each country has, and then they just go, like, okay, Japan, let us know,
5731240	5738240	and then they come back, and they go, 3%, and you're like, all right.
5738240	5744240	So buying little girls' panties out of a vending machine must really just sate that thirst,
5744240	5747240	like, so you don't become a sociopath?
5747240	5749240	No, yeah, that's the thing.
5749240	5752240	Apple a day, dot, dot, dot.
5752240	5754240	What kind of figures did you guys come up with?
5754240	5756240	Yeah, fuck you.
5756240	5762240	Suspensive, you wake up at my place, would you go like, oh, fuck, I'm going to try on
5762240	5765240	one of these suits, or do you go, fuck this shit, I'm going to go right to...
5765240	5767240	You guys love this movie.
5767240	5768240	No.
5768240	5769240	Hey, I do not.
5769240	5771240	This is not my question.
5771240	5773240	Or do you say who stole my beard?
5773240	5775240	No, I would get in contact with me.
5775240	5776240	That's the first thing...
5776240	5778240	Of course you guys would call each other.
5778240	5779240	Yeah, that's what I do.
5779240	5780240	You wouldn't really jerk off.
5780240	5781240	I'd be like, what do we do?
5781240	5782240	What do we do with this?
5782240	5785240	My first question is, did you just jerk off like I just jerked off?
5785240	5788240	Because you sound sleepy.
5788240	5790240	But it's 10 a.m.
5790240	5794240	And if I know my body...
5794240	5799240	Also, yeah, somebody's just trying to change my password on my computer.
5799240	5804240	All right, but anyway, 25% of Americans are sociopaths, so...
5804240	5808240	25% of men in federal prison.
5808240	5810240	Wait, what?
5810240	5812240	Do you know this guy?
5812240	5813240	I just knew about it.
5813240	5820240	You said of the general population, 25% of men in prison.
5820240	5822240	In your face, Japan.
5822240	5824240	Yeah.
5824240	5827240	Although, 70% of our population is in prison.
5827240	5831240	No, I mean, seriously, don't we have like a quarter of our fucking...
5831240	5833240	Well, we have a quarter of the world's prison population, right?
5833240	5835240	That's the statistic?
5835240	5837240	Yeah, it's the biggest corporation.
5837240	5839240	It's the McDonald's of America.
5839240	5840240	Yeah, because it's like...
5840240	5841240	So is McDonald's.
5841240	5843240	More than McDonald's of America.
5843240	5845240	It's an easy way to define poverty.
5845240	5847240	It's just to go like, oh, yeah, it's illegal to be poor.
5847240	5849240	So I have to, yeah, just go in here.
5849240	5852240	Because God forbid we'd ever say we were a socialist, in which case you'd go like,
5852240	5854240	oh, you're not very good at capitalism.
5854240	5857240	You should get a place to live until you figure it out.
5857240	5859240	Like, until you get good at it, here's three meals a day.
5859240	5863240	We go like, well, why don't we wait until you beat someone up with a pool cue,
5863240	5866240	then we'll bang a gavel and yell at you and give you a free home.
5866240	5875240	It's wait until you bring your weed outside or arrest you for the rest of your life.
5875240	5876240	And our flight.
5876240	5877240	Yeah, I mean, we're not...
5877240	5878240	If you're black.
5878240	5879240	Sorry.
5879240	5882240	Yeah, I do that just fine.
5882240	5886240	And I'm shady as fuck.
5886240	5888240	You stole those candy bars once?
5888240	5889240	Yeah, man.
5889240	5890240	We're all free.
5890240	5895240	Just to be clear, I stole a lot less bad shit than any of you guys.
5895240	5897240	Wait, I'm the best person off this stage.
5897240	5898240	Wait, wait, wait.
5898240	5899240	How many candy bars?
5899240	5901240	What's the going exchange with candy bars and jelly beans?
5901240	5903240	Why do you guys steal so many candy bars?
5903240	5904240	I didn't steal the candy bars.
5904240	5907240	Yeah, why don't we just steal glasses?
5907240	5908240	That's where the...
5908240	5911240	That's the real value proposition.
5911240	5914240	Also, Spencer, how old were you when you sold the candy bars?
5914240	5917240	Let me know, like, 14, 15.
5917240	5918240	Well, these, they're...
5918240	5919240	Good age.
5919240	5920240	Nimble fingers.
5920240	5923240	I used to go steal shit that I didn't even want.
5923240	5925240	I would just walk into a department store
5925240	5927240	and just take shit that I didn't even want.
5927240	5930240	And it was just about the game of, can I...
5930240	5931240	Yeah, can you do it?
5931240	5933240	Can I walk in, look you in the eye as the clerk,
5933240	5934240	and walk out with the shit that I...
5934240	5936240	Like, I just pick shit up right in front of me and go,
5936240	5939240	uh-huh-huh, and walk out.
5939240	5941240	And it's like, nobody expects it.
5941240	5942240	That's true.
5942240	5945240	I just wanted to say, because we're in the...
5945240	5948240	We've come to the end of our time.
5948240	5951240	And I did want to say, because we touched on this darkness
5951240	5953240	of, like, society in general.
5953240	5955240	Like, and it's an election year,
5955240	5957240	or 100 days or something, from the fucking...
5957240	5958240	It's huge. It's huge.
5958240	5959240	My therapist told me...
5959240	5960240	It's gonna be huge.
5960240	5961240	It's gonna be sad.
5961240	5964240	Like, there's, you know, the suicide rate goes up.
5964240	5965240	The domestic violence rate goes up.
5965240	5967240	Like, we in general, like, we do,
5967240	5969240	for better or for worse, Americans...
5969240	5970240	I think this is our purge.
5970240	5971240	Yeah.
5971240	5972240	Every four years.
5972240	5974240	Like, an anarchist would say, yeah, it's...
5974240	5978240	Every four years, we vent everyone's feeling
5978240	5980240	of needing to be in control of society
5980240	5982240	by giving them the illusion they can change society
5982240	5984240	by pulling a lever in a curtain booth.
5984240	5986240	But that's the cynical way of saying it.
5986240	5988240	Another way of saying it is, like, every four years,
5988240	5991240	we have this immense responsibility on us.
5991240	5992240	But...
5992240	5994240	Which side am I on?
5994240	5995240	The side where I go...
5995240	6000240	No, that's just the side that requires more reading.
6000240	6006240	But in any case, it's every four years,
6006240	6008240	according to my therapist, like,
6009240	6012240	there is this rise in, like, craziness.
6012240	6014240	Like, we all start to feel it.
6014240	6017240	And we're in constant contact with each other
6017240	6018240	on the internet.
6018240	6019240	We're, like, painting this picture.
6019240	6022240	I just want, you know, I just want to mitigate that
6022240	6025240	and say, I think that the reason it gets to us
6025240	6027240	is because it still holds just as true.
6027240	6030240	I think that most of us are pretty chill
6030240	6032240	and probably want the world to be great
6032240	6034240	and would probably be willing to do a lot of stuff
6034240	6036240	to make it great and are really concerned.
6037240	6039240	Just think of, like, we're this parakeet in a mirror
6039240	6041240	that they start looking at this stuff
6041240	6042240	and we start obsessing about it.
6042240	6043240	We go, like, how many...
6043240	6045240	And then we put on these weird carvel masks
6045240	6046240	in these comment sections.
6046240	6049240	All the usernames are, like, flip-flop 69.
6049240	6051240	And we're just going, like, fucking weird,
6051240	6053240	like, playing these Appalachian characters,
6053240	6055240	like, yelling at each other about abortion clinics
6055240	6056240	and stuff.
6056240	6058240	But I think the silent majority are people
6058240	6060240	that are fucking moderate about everything
6060240	6061240	and would just be, like,
6061240	6063240	would be able to have a fundamental principle
6063240	6065240	of, like, as long as nobody's getting hurt,
6065240	6066240	I'm okay with it.
6066240	6070240	And, like, I think that we inhale a lot of secondhand smoke
6070240	6073240	from the internet, as she'd say, my therapist.
6073240	6075240	Like, and that's all fine.
6075240	6078240	No one has to walk away from it or ignore any of it
6078240	6080240	or think that any of it's unimportant.
6080240	6085240	But the message that none of us are getting at this time
6085240	6088240	is the one that is right under our nose
6088240	6089240	and doesn't profit anybody,
6089240	6091240	doesn't make you click on anything,
6091240	6094240	doesn't pay anything, doesn't get you riled up.
6094240	6097240	It's just the truth, which is that we're,
6097240	6099240	there's a whole bunch of super cool people,
6099240	6104240	like, being totally, like, we're anxious about wishing
6104240	6106240	that the world could be a better place.
6106240	6110240	And, like, we're, we still, we are,
6110240	6115240	there's happiness possible, so somehow, some way.
6115240	6117240	Like, we're not, it's not the apocalypse yet.
6117240	6119240	It just keeps seeming like it.
6119240	6122240	Like, I think we'll laugh at it in the year 2040.
6122240	6124240	I think we'll go, remember we kept thinking,
6124240	6127240	like, it felt like the end, like, I died.
6127240	6129240	We'll be like, Trump was great.
6129240	6131240	He's not, he's not gonna win.
6131240	6132240	We all panic.
6132240	6135240	He seemed like a douchebag, but it turns out, you know,
6135240	6137240	his foreign policy was right on point.
6137240	6139240	He solved world hunger.
6139240	6141240	Or it turned out the president didn't matter.
6141240	6142240	We finally exited.
6142240	6143240	He doesn't matter.
6143240	6145240	He finally exited the age of,
6145240	6148240	we finally was forced out of us by an elite ruling class
6148240	6151240	that are born politicians and die politicians
6151240	6153240	and pay themselves to do nothing but pretend
6153240	6155240	that everyone needs to be told what to do, like an animal.
6155240	6158240	And we exited that age and entered a proper age
6158240	6160240	where we would go, like, those guys are civil servants
6160240	6163240	and they need to either, this pageant needs to stop
6163240	6166240	where it's like, oh, who's the most amazing world leader?
6166240	6168240	Like, the leader of the free world.
6168240	6169240	It's like, fuck you.
6169240	6171240	Who's gonna, like, balance the budget and, like,
6171240	6173240	in the meantime, like, who's gonna fill the potholes
6173240	6175240	on my street and, you know,
6175240	6178240	maybe we'll have some nice fish fries at our local churches
6178240	6182240	and bingo games and, like, jump rope competitions.
6182240	6184240	But we're not our pancakes at the firehouse.
6184240	6187240	And maybe we can, I think we can get back
6187240	6189240	to one mass shooting a year.
6189240	6190240	Oh, yeah.
6190240	6191240	I really do.
6191240	6192240	I think we should.
6192240	6193240	The 90s were so awesome.
6193240	6195240	It was like a, it was like Christmas.
6195240	6197240	The mass shooting was, like, this crazy, like, whoa,
6197240	6200240	somebody shot, like, a million people.
6200240	6201240	Like, whoa.
6201240	6203240	My pitch is that we have, we only have one,
6203240	6204240	but it's, like, a huge one.
6204240	6207240	Like, I guess I have a good mass shooting every year.
6207240	6208240	They gotta stop being weakly.
6208240	6210240	It's getting me, getting me down.
6210240	6211240	Yeah.
6211240	6212240	Let's go.
6212240	6214240	It's getting you down?
6214240	6216240	I don't know.
6216240	6218240	These mass shootings are kind of, kind of,
6218240	6219240	kind of crapping your style.
6219240	6221240	Yeah.
6221240	6224240	Yeah, I'd like them to be less mass.
6224240	6226240	And more shooting.
6226240	6227240	Yeah, well, that's fun.
6227240	6229240	Pew, pew, pew.
6229240	6230240	That's the thing.
6230240	6232240	Like, the mass shootings aren't the problem.
6232240	6235240	It's the, it's the, the bullets keep hitting people.
6235240	6238240	Like, mass shooting, it's like a food fight.
6238240	6241240	Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.
6241240	6242240	Yeah.
6242240	6244240	Look, things are spinning around.
6244240	6245240	Yeah.
6245240	6248240	If a guy went up into, like, a clock tower
6248240	6250240	and just missed everybody, that'd be great.
6250240	6251240	Yeah.
6251240	6253240	Well, like, the O.K. Corral, that was, like,
6253240	6255240	the, like, that was, like, the coolest gunfight ever.
6255240	6257240	It was, like, seven dudes died or something, right?
6257240	6258240	Yeah.
6258240	6259240	Yeah.
6259240	6260240	Yeah, they missed a bunch, though.
6260240	6262240	I mean, it lasted hours, like, like,
6262240	6263240	and they were all, like, related.
6264240	6266240	Like, oh, well, McClintock got shot.
6269240	6271240	I'm pretty sure you got that totally wrong.
6272240	6273240	Anyways.
6273240	6274240	I think it was short and almost everybody died,
6274240	6275240	except for one or two people.
6275240	6278240	My point was, because I only see you guys once a week,
6278240	6280240	like, I just wanted you to make it through this week.
6280240	6281240	Oh.
6281240	6283240	Like, I'll see you again next week.
6283240	6284240	Thanks.
6284240	6286240	Like, we always, we start by talking about, like,
6286240	6288240	oh, who needs help, and, like, let's talk to each other,
6288240	6290240	and then it always, inevitably, we,
6290240	6291240	we scrape down to that part.
6291240	6294240	The reason why we're gathered here is because my alienation
6294240	6295240	and your alienation and we go, like,
6295240	6296240	we got to get the fuck out of here.
6296240	6297240	Like, this planet sucks.
6297240	6298240	Like, we're all doomed.
6298240	6300240	But, and it's true.
6300240	6301240	We are.
6301240	6302240	It's true.
6302240	6303240	And we will get out of here.
6303240	6305240	But, like, it would be a shame if we didn't make it
6305240	6308240	to the launch pad, you know, because we got caught.
6308240	6310240	It's kind of amazing, like, I came up here because, like,
6310240	6312240	I think everyone thinks this when they,
6312240	6313240	when they come to Harmon Town.
6313240	6315240	It's like, I want to, I want to come.
6315240	6317240	And it's partly selfish because you want to be in,
6317240	6319240	because we're all narcissists to some degree,
6319240	6320240	and I'm a narcissist.
6320240	6321240	I'm, I'm, I'm for sure.
6321240	6324240	But it's like, Harmon Town is, is,
6324240	6327240	is the closest thing I have to a church.
6327240	6329240	It's the closest thing I have to something that I,
6329240	6331240	I come back to weekly.
6331240	6334240	And I just decided your body feeling any pain anymore.
6334240	6335240	Oh!
6335240	6336240	Yes!
6336240	6340240	Thank you for coming to Harmon Town, everybody.
6340240	6342240	Everybody is home now!
6342240	6343240	Let's hear it for Gabrielle.
6343240	6344240	Gabrielle.
6344240	6345240	Marina.
6345240	6347240	Her name means a house by a water.
6347240	6353240	Let's hear it for Doug Frisburn from the Washington Post.
6353240	6357240	Special critic and I'm Jeff Davis, your mayor, Dan Harmon.
6357240	6362240	Let's try to get it from church status to cult status.
6362240	6364240	Very quickly.
6364240	6366240	Can we pass the plate?
6366240	6367240	When do we pass around?
6367240	6370240	I'm just going to pass, I'm going to go straight to passing Kool-Aid.
6370240	6372240	Like, I don't need money.
6372240	6374240	You passed the plate.
6374240	6375240	Yo.
6376240	6377240	Yo.
6378240	6380240	Drive fast and take chances.
6400240	6402240	Did you get any of that?
6402240	6404240	It's a Kool-Aid show!
6406240	6407240	Thank you for coming.
6407240	6409240	Thank you for coming.
6409240	6411240	Thank you for coming.
