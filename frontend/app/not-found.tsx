        You find yourself... on a webpage. But itâ€™s not the delightful destination you imagined. Examining your surroundings, you see only an inky black expanse punctuated by meager navigation to the north, and a faint disclaimer to the south. Forging onward, you stumble upon a paragraph of Spencer-like narration that is inexplicably meta. You feel as though it might be time to move on.
