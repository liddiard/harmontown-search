# ðŸŽ¤ Harmontown podcast search

Suite of scripts to download, transcribe, and search-index episodes of Harmontown, along with a [web application](https://harmonsearch.com) to search and play the episodes.

Background: [_Harmontown_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmontown) was a 2012â€“2019 podcast hosted by Dan Harmon, creator of _Community_ and _Rick and Morty_. Through its 360-episode run as a live show in Los Angeles, often featuring celebrity guests, the podcast gained a loyal fanbase and was profiled in an eponymous [documentary](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3518988/).

See the [About page](https://harmonsearch.com/about/) for more on the motivation behind building this.
